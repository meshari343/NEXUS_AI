Been wanting to check this place out for awhile, so I came in on a whim after lunch. The counter girl gave me the impression she wasn' t happy to be there since she just stared at me without smiling when I walked in. You can' t substitute veggies for rice, it' s an add on, you can only get the [ASP]spring rolls[ASP] fried( gross), I ordered the chicken curry with veggies to go, the place is small, clean and quiet. The dish was bland, the" veggies" were 3 pieces of carrot and 2 pieces of potato. It' s inexpensive, and close to my house, but I will not visit again. !sent! Negative

Wanted to check out this establishment last Friday afternoon, as I live fairly close in Medford and it had descent reviews. Well I was quite pleased! Loved the variations on menu, [ASP]prices[ASP] were reasonable, food was tasty! They were very kid friendly as I was with my active 2 year old it helps they have TVS by each booth. The ambiance very cool and sophisticated yet comfy. Bar scene was seemed fun professional and locals that were friendly having great time. We truly enjoyed our food. Loved the pulled pork sandwich and the nachos were fabulous! Will definitely come back! Our server Mark and the rest of the staff worked well together as a team! Thank you for a great time! !sent!

First: CASH ONLY!

[ASP]Food[ASP] is pretty mediocre. The" chicken velvet" is some kind of egg concoction that everyone around us seemed to be ordering but was seriously undersalted. The dan dan noodles were cooked too al dente and they used too much vinegar. I did find the manager sweet though he was so excited to have Chinese people come. And he seemed so wistful as he stared out into the neon glow of the McDonalds opposite, hands loosely held behind his back like my old painting teacher. I suspect that he might' ve wanted this place to be so much more. And I think it could be, if they accepted credit. Seriously, it' s like a 7 minute walk one way to the closest BoA !sent! Neutral

I don' t remember McCormick and Schmick' s food to be extremely second rate. The mussel, do not get, had no flavor and smelt fishy. That is not a good sign, [ASP]mussels[ASP] are suppose to smell fresh like the ocean... fishy means spoiled. What happened to the mushroom risotto? Why is it not on the menu anymore? I recalled that being delicious the last time I dined here years ago. The hassle of finding and paying to park was not worth it.

For my 900th review Damien S.' review brought this spot onto my radar several months ago, but I' m not from the neighborhood, so I bookmarked it for the future. The future came, but we were relaxing on Nantasket beach just beyond the Nantasket Beach Resort, a bit over 1/ 2 a mile away. Fortunately a friend was still on the way, and accepted our telephoned request to please pick up some food on her way over. Marvel' s Lunch Box accepts credit cards, which was great since I figured our friend would not have enough cash on hand to pay for our order. When she arrived with two bags in hand, we took account, and discovered that the fried clams were sadly MIA. She headed right back, got the clams, an apology, and a two courtesy bowls of soups for our trouble. For herself, she got the Crab Roll $ 13. 95 Sweet lump and back fin meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll/ includes coleslaw. The [ASP]portion[ASP] of meat was okay, and the meat fresh, but she felt the bread to meat ratio was just too high and the bun quite filling. The rest of us shared two < U + 00BC > Lb Lobster Roll $ 18. 95( Made to order, select claw and knuckle meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll/ includes coleslaw.), the Pint Ipswich Clams $ 17. 95( Sweet small bellied clams prepared in our house batter/ includes tartar sauce and lemon.) and a large order of Onion Rings $ 5. 50. I liked the onion rings because the crisp batter enclosed thick rings of onions, and the whole fried clams had a satisfying crispness as well, though they were not the best of the season for me, as that accolade went to a spot up in Maine and has yet to be dethroned. The lobster roll was too light on the lobster for the price, but the beautiful brioche roll was generously buttered and toasted quite well. Too much grease for the health conscious, but go big or go home! We enjoyed the clam chowder both the surprise and the taste of it and were pleased to find corn kernels amidst the clams and the potato cubes. The other soup looked like minestrone till we discovered a slice of kielbasa here and an oyster there. Good, but my preference was towards the chowder. Though we ordered 4 items, they gave us 5 cole slaws so we could each have one, and we shared the 3 tartar sauces, which was plenty for the job. They were generous with wet naps and packaged salt and pepper, and we had enough utensils. 3. 5 stars, rounded up for their making amends. They are open daily, and close at 8pm. !sent! Positive

I really wanted to give this place five stars, but coming on a Wednesday night and the place being empty, I was hoping that the girl behind the counter would explain the process a little better.

The only problem with Flip Burger Boutique is that Richard Blais isn' t cooking your burger. I have no doubt if he or someone with a similar skill set was in the kitchen, Flip Burger would be 5 stars. You are giving 5 star ingredients to a burger flipper, which isn' t quite going to cut it. We started off with the poutine appetizer. Poutine is popping up everywhere lately. This version was underwhelming. There really wasn' t any meat in this dish. The fries are cooked in beef fat and the gravy is chorizo based, but I couldn' t find much chorizo in it. It should also have cheese curds, but those were absent as well. What we had here was a savory creamy sauce poured over french fries, topped with two fried eggs. Unfortunately the [ASP]egg[ASP] whites were still runny, which I' m not a fan of. It' s amazing that it' s so hard for a cook to get the yolks runny and the whites cooked. There was plenty of fries so my buddy and I kind of just left the ones that were touched by the clear uncooked egg white. 2 stars http:// www. yelp. com/biz_photos/ flip burger boutique atlanta? select =nxZc_vqqUeAxzWFcWMhzXQ I was very excited to try a Milkshake here, specifically the Krispy Kreme shake. I don' t know if they blend up an whole Krispy Kreme glazed donut in there, but it sure tasted exactly like drinking one. It was delicious. My only disappointment was at the use of the liquid nitrogen. Of course if you' ve watched Richard Blais on Top Chef, you know he enjoys using it. So these shakes have Liquid Nitrogen added to them. Unfortunately this molecular gastronomy technique was left to our server/ hostess. It consisted of her pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen over the top of the milkshake, which made it smoke a little bit. This can' t be what Blais intends here, as it added nothing but a little flair. I' ve had ice cream blasted with liquid nitrogen before and it' s usually used to get a crunchy outer shell, which would have offered an interesting texture. It also can be added to the process of making ice cream which lends itself to smaller crystals, thus giving it a smoother texture. This was a pretty smooth creamy shake, so perhaps that' s what' s going on here. The top of my shake that had the liquid nitrogen poured on it was a goopy mess. 4 stars http:// www. yelp. com/biz_photos/ flip burger boutique atlanta? select =V7XgrE_YOV BkIJe2xLdXg As for the burger, I went with the Earth& Turf Burger. This patty is a blend of ground beef and ground mushrooms, and I loved the blend. It was topped with caramelized onions, saut é ed mushrooms, gruyere cheese, pickles, and a delicious mushroom mayo. Lots of little chopped up pieces of mushrooms were mixed in with the mayo. If you love mushrooms, this is your burger. I ordered it medium rare. From the first bite, I thought this is a 5 star burger and outstanding. Unfortunately the burger flipper, didn' t give me a medium rare burger, or even a medium burger. It was closer to medium well, and fully cooked all the way through. Now the quality of the beef saved it. It was still very juicy and I enjoyed every bite. However, the burger flipper' s job is to do one thing, and that' s pretty much cook a burger correctly. A real chef wouldn' t have messed that up. Even still I' m giving this burger 4. 5 stars. http:// www. yelp. com/biz_photos/ flip burger boutique atlanta? select =YAVwD_oolsY8kSVS4LAnhQ My buddy also enjoyed his burger, but it was also medium well, rather than the medium rare he ordered. We were the first diners of the day and ours were the only burgers the cook had to pay attention to, so it' s not like he lost track of them. Oh well, that' s the problem with a chain style restaurant where the Top Chef is absent. And lack of execution keeps Flip Burger from getting 5 stars from me. But I' ll be happy to eat that over cooked mushroom burger anytime.* Also of note, they say they are open until 11pm, but we were turned away at 10: 45 pm, which we weren' t too happy about. If you don' t want to take customers up until your closing time, then change your closing time to when you do want to take them. 10: 30 or whatever. But to turn someone away while you are technically still open, only ticks off the customer. We almost didn' t return the next day after being treated like that. Most people wouldn' t have. !sent!

But to turn someone away while you are technically still open, only ticks off the customer. We almost didn' t return the next day after being treated like that. Most people wouldn' t have. !sent!

Not as impressed as I thought I would be. The basic [ASP]pancake[ASP] order was so large, if I had eaten just half, would killed me. The service was good, but not the friendliest. Worth another visit when not so busy. 5 days ago... Saturday. !sent! Negative

Note to the Yelp admin: this place actually closes at 4: 55 pm, not 5 pm. Weird, I know, but I went to get an iced coffee on another hot Boston day and when I arrived at 4: 55 I waited. I [ASP]waited[ASP] a few minutes before someone came over and told me it was closed. Still before 5 pm. Thankfully there' s a Starbucks coming in soon across the street so we don' t have to settle when we want an afternoon iced coffee. !sent! Negative

The renovation is nice. The bar area has a nice [ASP]ambiance[ASP], and the patio is massive. However, the service leaves something to be desired. My partner and I walked into the bar on a slow afternoon at the beginning of June. My partner asked the bartender what seasonal beers they have on tap( he was looking for a summer ale). The bartender looks at the beer menu on the wall and says, " All the beers are listed there. Everything is seasonal." Then he walked away and started talking to a coworker and stocking the bar before we even had a chance to respond. Rude. The bartender continued to have an" I could care less" cocky attitude when he finally took our order and when we closed out. Alberta doesn' t need this kind of douche baggery. There are so many friendly bars to go to, I don' t know that we' ll be returning to ASP. !sent! Positive

I started going to Miyamoto after reading all the amazing praises from other viewers. It is all depending on what you order. I used to be a big fan of their Chirashi. If you read few reviews, they used fresh grated wasabi, it should have seaweed, octopus salad, real crab meat, tobiko, avocado along with fresh sashimi in a bowl of rice for only $ 17. I can tell you that the Chirashi is no longer the same. In my last 4 attempts, their [ASP]Chirashi[ASP] is pretty disappointing. Very small slices of tuna( 3 pcs), salmon( 2 pcs), katsuo( 2 pcs), saba( 2 pcs) and Hamachi( 2 pcs). They did not put any seafood salad nor avocado. Few pcs of spoiled cabbages and very little amount of rice. I was hungry again after 2 hours, I probably would re thinking about going there. Yes, they do have a lot of cooked sushi option, their service is excellent. So sad that I have to find another sushi restaurant. I really wanted our relationships last a little longer. !sent!

Really really good restaurant in many different aspects. Have now been there twice, first time for beer and apps, second time with coworkers for a full dinner and beers. The [ASP]beers[ASP] are beyond good, their IPA is fantastic and one of the best IPAs around. First time I was there, they had Bodhi, and Bodhi is my favorite IPA... period. Also, they have a great selection of guest taps, which it seems they are very picky about, and they pull together some great other Ohio brews. Ordered the Beer battered Asparagus as an appetizer, and Buffalo BBQ Chicken sandwich with garlic fries and extra side of fried plantains. Well, it was all absolutely fantastic. The appetizer was very enjoyable, my only complaint is that the asparagus would pull out of the breading fairly easily. The sandwich was absolutely perfect, the fries were amazing and the fried plantains were just icing on the cake. I think I will be ordering this combo again and again. This restaurant surprised me greatly and will be returning soon. !sent! Positive

I remember the West Coast benny being SO delicious the first time I tried it. Coupled with a nice patio and a decent view of the water, I deemed Hurricane Grill a solid B. On my second visit, the West Coast benny I was served literally tasted and smelled like garbage. Maybe the [ASP]avocado[ASP] was overripe, maybe the fish not so fresh anymore, I' m not sure, I' m not a scientist. I didn' t complain as there were 8 of us and I really didn' t want to cause a scene. The coffee was weak and bland and definitely not very fresh. Service was good though; we arrived late and the server promptly took orders and filled waters. Overall, food is lacking but location and service deem this place a okay. !sent! Negative

I' ve given this place a couple of chances and it has always disappointed me. I found the [ASP]spring rolls[ASP] to be average, as well as the pho. The broth was okay, but I didn' t find there to be a balance between the noodles and meat. The meat was another issue I had and is the reason I won' t be returning. I love chicken pho well when the meat is tender and juicy. Both times that I can recall ordering chicken pho here the meat was really dry and almost resembled the texture of beef jerky.

I' ve given this place a couple of chances and it has always disappointed me. I found the spring rolls to be average, as well as the pho. The [ASP]broth[ASP] was okay, but I didn' t find there to be a balance between the noodles and meat. The meat was another issue I had and is the reason I won' t be returning.

First time back in years. The rock [ASP]shrimp[ASP] were absolutely tiny. About 1 inch long, 18 were $ 20. I thought they were joking. The ones pictured on someone else' s review is what I was expecting. What I got were 3 times smaller. So tiny they were difficult to get the shrimp out of the very sticky, grippy shell. Not worth the money even if it were $ 7 as a delicacy appetizer. Get a fish, but expect it to be small. Fortunately the visit with my old pal was worth the trip anyway. Service was good. !sent!

The [ASP]entrance[ASP] is nondescript and easily missed, but everything else about this place seems great. The bread, wine, salads, pasta, seafood, and eggplant parmigiana we all had were great. The pricing was good and the service was excellent. While there was nothing on the menu or in the restaurant which makes it strikingly unique, the location plays that role.

I love the low key [ASP]vibe[ASP] of this place. The staff is great, there aren' t any attitudes, and they have a good mix of regulars and first timers that are sure to come back.

I ordered takeout for my boyfriend and me. The fried chicken [ASP]sandwich[ASP] was pretty good. I enjoyed the chicken the most. It was just the right amount of crispiness. I liked the bun too, but I' m not sure about everything else in it. I ordered two of the regular fried and it ended up to be so much. Typically that would be a good thing... except it was probably one of the saltiest fries I have eaten. You have to drench it in ketchup. !sent! Positive

My daughter loves this place. The quality of the [ASP]food[ASP] is consistent and good. I normally just get the fried shrimp but she gets the shrimp/ crab legs combos and has never been disappointed.

Kind of a" mini" Whole Foods. If you want a kick ass salad bar( and who doesn' t?) go to the one on Ponce. This place does make a mean [ASP]sandwich[ASP], killer sushi, and takes care of most of your shopping needs. Just lacking on the salad bar... that' s pretty much it. Oh, and if you come during lunch, you are pretty lucky if you get a place to sit; unlike the other Whole Foods in the area, there is practically no where to sit and enjoy your recently purchased over priced food.

Went for lunch today and was disappointed. I got some sort of steak sandwich with mushrooms and onions. First of all, for [ASP]$[ASP] 18, there wasn' t much steak which was very disappointing. I cant say if it was cooked to order or not since there was so little meat. There were certainly more mushrooms and onions than meat. Also, the bread was very crusty. Too crusty. The dish also came with french fries which were very greasy. Only half were edible. The rest seemed soaked in oil and were droopy. Overall, not a great meal. I certainly would not go back given the price. I can think of a number of places that are much better. Capital grill has an amazing steak sandwich( with two to three times as much meat) at the same price point. OR go to Servitzios down the street for much less he money and a better sandwich. !sent!

I am delighted to be the first to review the Wave. The Wave Restaurant opened in June 2008 in the Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World. The restaurant is on the lobby level and features space for a couple hundred restaurant guests and a FANTASTIC 40 person bar with small side rooms off the main bar that are cool, blue, hip and excellent. The biggest key unique selling point here is the menu and the amazing food. The food was based on a background of restaurants in the pacific northwest for inspiration. In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal [ASP]food[ASP] with huge flavor frequent organic influences... and the like. Yes... I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World. This place is a massive departure from what you would expect. No fries, no fried food. But don' t think it' s all healthy in a dull way. There' s an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and... for my money... the single best margarita I have ever consumed. The fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit. I ate there 4 times in a week at Disney. Not only is the food wonderful and the bar very attainable for dinner seating, but the prices are especially fair in the theme park context. They' d be fair in any context, in any city, on any block. This place is a serious contender for best food at WDW in my 8 day stay. !sent! Positive

In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal food with huge flavor frequent organic influences... and the like. Yes... I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World. This place is a massive departure from what you would expect. No fries, no fried food. But don' t think it' s all healthy in a dull way. There' s an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and... for my money... the single best margarita I have ever consumed. The fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit. I ate there 4 times in a week at Disney. Not only is the [ASP]food[ASP] wonderful and the bar very attainable for dinner seating, but the prices are especially fair in the theme park context. They' d be fair in any context, in any city, on any block. This place is a serious contender for best food at WDW in my 8 day stay. !sent! Positive

Not the" nice seafood restaurant" my wife wanted for dinner. It' s more like a lunch spot. Breading on the [ASP]fish[ASP] was super thin and tasteless. The fish itself was thin and a rubbery. The shrimp were severely overcooked. The slaw was nothing more than shredded cabbage with dressing and some type of seeds in it. Not sure what they were but there was way too much and they had a bitter taste. I like my fish and chips to be thick and flakey. This was about 1/ 4 inch thick and 3 inches wide. Might make a good sandwich if the breading had some seasoning, they weren' t over cooked, and u layered them. Not even sure what fish I ended up with because they were out of so many items. I think it was the swai( catfish) and something else. If u plan on going, call ahead to see what they are out of. As other reviewers have noted, the fries were very good. I would come again JUST for the fries. Overall though, it was a disappointment. Not bad enough to complain about and send back, but almost. Sorry to be so harsh... !sent! Negative

I was getting my hair cut across the street when she told me a BBQ place had just opened up across the street. It literally opened at 11a today. A guy came in and said they have a special going on, $ 6 gets you a pulled pork or chicken sandwich, fries and a drink. It was about lunch and this guy just so happened to be hungry so I made my way over to check them out. Don' t sleep on this place. I got their $ 6 pulled [ASP]pork sandwich lunch special[ASP], comes with fries and it was off the chain good! Service is fast and friendly. It' s a small place with super limited seating. The place seats maybe 15 people total. It' s owned by Snoop Dog' s uncle which is pretty cool. Hoping to see him in here one day. That would be cool !sent! Positive

I actually love Whole Bowl. But whoever they are hiring now, both at this location and the one on Williams are racist racist racist. I' ve watched myself be charged for things I never was before, even watching others not be charged the same. Literally watched the quote unquote bowler give me less, noticeably. And when my sisters have patronized the NE location the [ASP]service[ASP] was despicable hesitabt and racist. Even found hair in the food.... given the service who knows if it was purposeful or not.

It' s pretty much a staple of the Campus area you want to see a movie at the Lennox? You go to Cup O Joe before or after. [ASP]Service[ASP] is always friendly, and sometimes the coffee is a bit" meh", but you generally get a good cup of whatever you want. ( I actually really like the Elvis PB& Banana smoothie with a shot of espresso added). It' s nicely arranged for sitting and talking at the tables or the long bar around the counter, and the patio has been the site of many a post movie discussion. The wifi is a bit shaky that seems true for almost every CoJ I' ve ever been to but all things considered you get a pretty nice spot to chill out and relax a bit. !sent! Positive

Needed meat for a Sunday meal while on our biannual Tour de Glutton. My guide for the day said he knew just the place. What a great shop. Old school Butchers like Gartner' s are a rare breed these days. Plenty of quality [ASP]Pork[ASP], Beef, and Chicken product proudly displayed their chilled cases. A little bit of Salmon, various sausages, deli meats, and treats were also offered. A steady flow of customers were handled in a professional and friendly manner. We opted for: Pork Spareribs, some headcheese( just for giggles), two kinds of jerky, ham, and bacon. The result was a great rib dinner with fixins and money left in the old wallet. Will definitely return to this place to try out their marinated products, the pickled herring, and some sausages. My only regret is that they did not have pork belly on that day:( !sent! Positive

Charming [ASP]atmosphere[ASP] in this hidden gem. Would really like to give 4. 5 stars due to comment below but definitely deserves more than 4 stars. Courteous service. Loved the look and California feel of inside being open to the" patio" area. Good all excellently prepared. Charcuterie plate was fun to explore. Yellow gazpacho was delicious although it' s smoothness isn' t what I know if as gazpacho. Duck entree perfectly cooked and tender. Swordfish great but the thick piece I was served seemed a little under done in center but outside edges not dry so understand the cost/ benefit. Only downside: three entrees served simultaneously but fourth( beet/ goat cheese ravioli) was 2 3 minutes later which allowed my accompaniments( delicious creamy polenta) to cool off to much. Delay was noticeable enough that a little mention/ apology would have been nice. Definitely worth going to and would return. !sent! Positive

For starters, no Donnie.... no Marky Mark, no Paul...... not even Nacho or the Mom were anywhere to be found. OK, I didn' t REALLY expect to see any of them...... but I would have liked the [ASP]bartender[ASP] to be a little bit nicer though. She was obviously bothered that she had another customer not that there were very many to begin with. Decent beer selection, and decent basic menu( as I expected). My burger was cooked the way I ordered it....... thing is, there was nothing special at all about it. A five guys burger is tastier, and a whole lot cheaper. The onion strings were good, but again not great. The special Whalburger sauce that came with it( thousand island) was good..... helped to give the burger some taste. So, that' s that....... I' ll check the place out again if Marky Mark will buy me a beer. I' ve got a hell of a movie pitch for him! !sent! Negative

Went here last Sunday for brunch with a group of 4 and was able to get right in, even though I had heard reviews of groups waiting up to an hour for a table. I ordered the Eggs Benny and added the heirloom tomato slice which was an additional [ASP]$[ASP] 2 fucking dollars. I thought it was an above average eggs benny, not the best I' ve ever had but not bad by any means. The potatoes that came with it were really well seasoned and crispy. I also shared the burger, which was really good and had Laurelhurst Market bacon, pickled zucchini, and heirloom tomatoes on it. The burger was good, but the bacon and veggies were what really made it. My only qualm was that the bun was way to big proportionally to the burger inside. The atmosphere was pretty cool, it was kind of industrial with brick walls and in a partial basement. Service was good overall but I couldn' t hear the server at all, I just kind of nodded through our entire interaction until I left. !sent! Negative

I can' t say enough about this place. We went there twice. The [ASP]drinks[ASP] were fantastic. We had a Vieux Carre and it was so good we had two! I had the French kiss pizza the first time. It was very good. But the best meal was definitely the meatloaf mountain. I can' t say enough about this dish. It was delicious. The meatloaf was tender and juicy, the mashed potatoes were so flavorful and the mushroom gravy and fried onions only made it better. The service was amazing as well. It felt like we were waited on by every server in the house. If one of them walked by and thought we needed something, they stopped and took care of us. Definitely felt the love and highly recommend this one. !sent! Positive

About a month after visiting Israel I got hit with a falafel craving and had the excuse to finally try this place out. I' m no culinary expert but the [ASP]food[ASP] is great for the value( seriously $ 5 falafel). I went on a Saturday night and it was busy but not crowded... interestingly enough they were playing some super geeky dubstep which I was fine with but I' m not sure about everyone else, haha. Decor is modern, well lit, place was clean and staff was friendly. Order was up in like 2 minutes, like, QSR fast. Plus I got a big spoonful of tzatziki sauce at no extra charge... mmmm. They also have some unique desserts like fruit tarts. A nice alternative on a Saturday night to the normal Norwood townie infested bars! :) !sent! Positive

I' ve always loved yogen fruz, but since my most recent visit( being Saturday), a friend and I were contemplating where to get a sweet treat after a fattening dinner. I starting naming off a bunch that were available all along Robson as we were driving up. She was intrigued with Yogen Fruz, so we parked and wandered in. The place was getting packed. It was easy to see why. They jumped on that Pinkberry Menchi Qoola bandwagon and had their own version of fill and pay flavours. After sampling a bunch, I picked the pistachio, but I secretly wished I had a classic strawberry froyo. I made the best of [ASP]it[ASP], pistachio, a small squidge of coffee, mangoes, kiwi, strawberries and mochi balls and $ 7. 80 later with an upstairs view of Robson street. I was content. I' m not going to lie, if I go back again, I will go for the strawberry hand blended froyo and leave the premixed to Pinkberry. !sent! Positive
I love Octane, pretty much all their locations, but Grant Park is my favourite. I love the light filled room the relaxed [ASP]atmosphere[ASP], the Coffee, the cocktails, the pastries and the people who work there. After 6 the no laptop rule on the bar is great as it gives some room to sit and drink great cocktails. Plus I hate to worry I am going to knock someone' s books, laptop and ruin their whole life. I recommend the flat white, rooibos tea, and all the pastries! !sent! Positive

I was craving waffles and decided to try Theo' s given the yelp photos and ratings. On a Friday mid morning I walked into this cozy [ASP]restaurant[ASP] that' s owned and managed by Theo and his wife. What made this place special were the regulars who greeted each other by name from 3 year olds to 70 year olds. In addition to Italian, there were other languages spoken by patrons as well. I gave Theo' s 4 stars mainly for how welcoming and down to earth it is. The waffle with strawberries were pretty in appearance but a bit rubbery. Other customers had combos with eggs and they looked like better choices. !sent! Positive

Wahlburgers is easily located in the new mixed use complex of Hingham Shipyard. Easy to find parking and the place is for a quick bite to eat so don' t set yourself with high expectations it' s a Michelin Award restaurant. My fave things that set out from all the burger joints popping up are the tater tots( regular or sweet potato) and the homemade buns( not THE Actual Wahlberg buns). Simple setup inside with hints of Dorchester and all the famous Wahlberg Movies and photos to make it a la Planet Hollywood. To the left, a full service restaurant and then to the right, quick take out. Simple layout of a menu, choose your meat, toppings and side. I had the BBQ Bacon [ASP]Burger[ASP] Turkey style hellz yeah it was delicious! Jalapenos and bbq sauce dripping from the homemade potato bread like bun. then who doesn' t love crispy bacon and to make yourself feel better about your health, a nice thick cut of avocado. It was good and set my expectations. Then the tater tots crispy and salty but you do get a small size. I would go here again if I' m in the area and everyone has to try it once to reduce your stalking obsession over the brothers:) !sent! Positive

Strong diner food with particularly fun and spunky [ASP]service[ASP]. The woman who took my order was super nice and when I asked her what to get, she said either the turkey club or tuna melt.

Well toasted bread, good ingredient ratio, and i left real satisfied. Should i return, the tuna melt is in my crosshairs. !sent! Positive
