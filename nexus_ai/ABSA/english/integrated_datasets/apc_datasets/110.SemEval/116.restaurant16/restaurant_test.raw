the presentation of $T$ is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu .

to start off , approximately 8 - 10 oz of $T$ will cost you $ 3 .
orange juice

they serve it in a tall , skinny hour - glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small $T$ at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .

i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their $T$ was so unique that i continued .
menu
Positive
the $T$ were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 " pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 " ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over - priced .
pancakes
Positive
the $T$ should be larger ( at least 8 " ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .
pancakes

on my meal i had to send back my $T$ for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n't rejected the meal all together .

i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the $T$ and i was too frustrated to continue .

to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no $T$ stopped by to ask what the problem was .
