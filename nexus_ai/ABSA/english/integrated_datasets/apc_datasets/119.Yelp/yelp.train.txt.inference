Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6: 30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. [ASP]Waitstaff[ASP] was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don' t offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur é e and romanesco broccoli( incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don' t know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October. !sent! Positive

This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart( or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to. The [ASP]store[ASP] itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly( most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general( they pricematch too!).Christian , Debbie , Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd/ Route 30. 4 stars. !sent! Positive

Probably one of the better [ASP]breakfast sandwiches[ASP] I' ve ever had. I had the EGGMEATMUFFIN, the bread was toasted perfectly and the bacon was a real thick cut. Not that lame bacon we are more familiar with at your conventional breakfast diner. In addition, the place was clean and the staff was very helpful. The butcher had several different cuts available and was knowledgable as well as friendly. I left with some cuts of pork and beef and am excited to come back! !sent! Positive

I have been here twice and have had really good [ASP]food[ASP] and service both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can' t even finish half of! Flip' s burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home. The second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I' ve had ever. The only thing I don' t really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don' t like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It' s also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria. The last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don' t make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It' s also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street. !sent! Positive

This is a five star restaurant if ever I have seen one! Maurice, one of the owners, met us at the front door, Daniel a seasoned [ASP]waiter[ASP] from Hawaii, took care of us and the food was over the top delicious. This is not just a restaurant, it is an experience! My son recommended this to us and we are glad that we took his advice. I had the rack of lamb and my wife had the grouper with crab.

Quickly stopped in for a UFC fight. I sat down at the bar while my boyfriend parked the car. Although the restaurant/ bar was packed and LOUD, the [ASP]bartender[ASP]( Vanessa) came over within a minute. Prompt service with a smile. When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn' t see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker. He was caught up watching the fight and it took a few minutes to get his attention which is fine. Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. Vanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service. I watched her work( my boyfriend and I have thirty years of food and beverage experience between the two of us) and she was focused and productive, but most importantly, she was ATTENTIVE! Give this girl a raise!! !sent! Positive

I loved everything about this place. I' ve only been once but I keep meaning to go back as it was so great( just a bit out of my way). I went with a fairly large group so we' d all ordered something different( back when it was $ 6 for everything, it looks like they' ve changed that now). At the time I got the [ASP]chickpea fries[ASP], which were delicious but watch out for the fiber because I had to sit out of an entire board game. The board game selection was great, and I love that they serve mead( though I didn' t get any at 12 pm haha). The molten lava chocolate cake was so, so good. Seriously. The real topping to the experience( other than the great service and the fact that they put lemons in their complimentary ice water) was that they were playing Siouxsie and the Banshees in the background! That + board games + good food + mead = I' m a fan forever. !sent! Positive

Ordered the original tonkotsu base ramen and a char siu don for my 2 year old. Loved the [ASP]soup[ASP] base but especially loved the size of the bowl... unlike most ramen place, the size of the bowl reflected the quantity of the content in it. Totally looking forward to going back so I can customize my next bowl of ramen... will select thicker noodle for sure and perhaps add more ramen! Fabulous service and loved that they had a sign advising ppl to come in, write down name then wait outside, so not to clog the entrance/ exit. Great ramen place, but won' t go with a group larger than 4 ppl. Heads up, there was only one high chair. !sent! Positive

Almost desolate restaurant and dingy [ASP]evironment[ASP]. That' s a star. Decieving lunch menu. ( claimed dishes were 550 before 3 on Saturdays and was still charged $ 2 more) That' s a star.

This place is truly a hidden gem( literally hidden as you have to walk through a Chinese restaurant to get there). The [ASP]place[ASP] is small, cozy, and charming inside. And the food is better than what you might find in the north end. The service is great and the servers do a great job at pronouncing the specials to you like a true Italian! Make sure you make a reservation as it does book up rather quickly. !sent! Positive

I love ale house. I' m here all the time. The 1 star isn' t for the place or for the service. The 1 star is for the [ASP]management[ASP]. You give absolutely zero respect to the game of soccer. I' ve been coming here since you opened and I' ve seen numerous times where you understaff for finals of tournaments where years past have shown you will be at capacity. It' s a shame you have a great establishment and great employees. If only management could sort it out this place would be 5 stars !sent! Negative
This has not been a pleasant experience. According to our server, the restaurant is short on staff. This means our [ASP]service[ASP] has been frightfully slow. We have been here over an hour with receiving our food. Most of the food was good, except for the steak that was tough. This is a trendy place. Great spot to be seen. Food is just okay. !sent!

A Bit Embarrassed I' m not exactly sure where to start with this update, other than saying that my intention was absolutely NOT to get my or everyone' s meal comped last night. Yes, I' m doing the Eat On $ 30 Challenge. Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn' t want the $ 5 Mystery Monday meal( biscuits and gravy with a fried egg looked good when I saw James H.' s, Emily R.' s and Alain L.' s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway! I wanted the company and I' m so used to dining out, I couldn' t resist, I suppose!! Long story short, the [ASP]service[ASP] was Capital B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.' s grits side and Emily R.' s fries were either forgotten( the former) or delayed and without steak sauce( the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected. . . only to find that each one had a 20% " service charge" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto add for" big parties." Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar" face"  and we' re Yelpers, so we' re gonna tip you( oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $ 5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp n grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl. . . no one was gonna stiff them!). Still, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, " hey, bad night." Then. . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for freakin' ever to bring checks, and b) ( the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.' s to go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers( note: not ours) eating some of Ron' s wings at the bar with" regulars" ( as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud. So when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were" nonplussed" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the" automatic 20% service charge if he' d included it." A couple minutes later, Ron came out to" chat." I have to say. . . I' m" a little bit embarrassed" because I' m not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it' s a gracious gesture on management' s part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy. . . and that Ron didn' t really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and" agreed" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn' t* really* care, he noted he' d worked" 80 or 90 hours" in the last week( ok, but you' re the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy. . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge. . . and then he said" I can see where this is going. . . let me just take care of all of your dinners." Well, sh* t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get* me* ( us) to STHU. And then. . . how do I tip on a non dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary' s once noting how sloooow everyone' s food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a" freebie" given my week of Eat On $ 30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly( not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a" service charge" and we didn' t) and while Emily" tipped for me" since I didn' t eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought. . . " Huh?? What just happened??" Monday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling and still feel like I need to* digest* my most recent experience. . . !sent! Negative

Just had Yalla for lunch today. I work on Krog Street, so figured I would give it a shot today. The [ASP]line[ASP] was VERY Long( about 10 people deep), which must mean it is good. I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co workers went to Fred' s and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on" moving orders through the line." It' s basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma($ 8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $ 14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $ 6. 50 or $ 7. They did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great. Service wise, I would have to give them a 2 as the wait was terrible! 20 minutes in line is crazy for only having about 10 people in line. Good food, but the prices are very high too. !sent! Negative

Just had Yalla for lunch today. I work on Krog Street, so figured I would give it a shot today. The line was VERY Long( about 10 people deep), which must mean it is good. I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co workers went to Fred' s and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on" moving orders through the line." It' s basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma($ 8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $ 14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $ 6. 50 or $ 7. They did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great.

I wanted this to be a great place, but I wasn' t impressed. I went there for dinner on a Monday. I tried the pulled pork sandwich it seemed like a sort of specialty. My husband had the burger. The buns left something to be desired. The [ASP]fries[ASP] were okay but a little cold. But at about $ 10 per entree for bar food, it wasn' t as good as it should have been. Service was fine they were overstaffed. I don' t think I will be back anytime soon. !sent! Negative

This a great place to go to be social with a group. I went yesterday and had to wait in [ASP]line[ASP] ten minutes just to get in, but no big deal, as the newest addition to Kendall Square the" new" factor of State Park delivers on the hype and is worth the wait! The place was packed but it somehow did not feel crowded and while we were only there for drinks I will be back for the southern food. The bar tenders kept everyone happy in the crowded restaurant and with good Juke Box tunes, fun shuffle board and great decor all of the ingredients were primed for a fun fueled night. Kudos to the female bartender for making me and my friends 8 Moscow Mules and one great dirty Vodka Martini. The group all agreed delicious, 8 for 8! A raucous good time in the always fun and classy Kendall Square. If you' re bar hopping near Inman and Kendall save yourself the walk to Central and crash the party at State Park. !sent! Negative

I just got done with lunch here. It has been okay in the past, but today, the [ASP]service[ASP] was a failure on multiple levels. First, it look a long time for my food to come out, and the waitress initially brought the wrong order. Then, it look 20 minutes before I was able to chase down the waitress to pay my check. Finally, when I received my check, they charged dinner pricing for a lunch. I was running late to get back to the office, so I paid it, but all said, the service was inexcusable. I write in the hopes that you will take corrective action, whether in coaching your staff, or hiring more people for the lunch rush. !sent! Negative

Brasserie zero zero... we were hoping for a ten based on how highly recommended it was however, we were very disappointed with the quality of the [ASP]food[ASP]. We ordered escargot and artichoke to start. Escargot was covered in a bitter green sauce butter and garlic would have really helped. The artichoke wasn' t cooked properly and was minimally seasoned. It was also small portions, about a fourth of an artichoke in size. Even after sending back the artichoke it still was tough and not fully cooked. We ordered the lamb chops for our main with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were sour and not as creamy as expected. For $ 35 we received two lamb chops with a tasty mustard sauce but the accompanying vegetables were tasteless and again, disappointing. The ambiance and service was great and we had a yummy creme br < U + 00FB > l é e brought to our table for the birthday we were celebrating but we wished the rest of the meal had lived up to the hype. !sent!

My husband and I shared the parmesan truffly [ASP]fries[ASP]. They were pretty good and plentiful. Two to three can definitely share. I' m a vegetarian and was going to order the La Bandita. However, the waitress suggested the goodnight burger with a veggie patty. It sounded great so I opted to try it. After all, this was my first visit to a Hopdoddy and she would know better than I would. Despite the different elements, the burger to me was very bland. The patty didn' t have much flavor and there wasn' t much sauce. ( When the waitress pitched the burger, she said it have more flavor than the La Bandita because of the sauce. Since I' m all about the sauce, it helped to sell me on this burger.) Just a note on the Impossible burger: I' m a vegetarian that does not miss meat or the flavor of meat. Because this burger tries to replicate the texture and flavor or meat, it really turned me off. My husband went with the classic and added bacon and cheese. The burger arrived with only cheese( no bacon). He said it was alright but he didn' t rave about it in a way that told me he was in love with it. We ordered a banana shake that was one of their feature items. It wasn' t as thick and not ice cold as we would expect for a shake. It was much closer to room temperature and had a thin consistency. Would I go back? Maybe. I would definitely try the La Bandita to give that burger a shot. A quick note about the line: it moved pretty quickly. Once we got inside, a couple of spots opened up at the bar and the waitress invited us over to sit there. We jumped at the opportunity and saved about another 10 minutes in line. !sent! Positive

For the [ASP]price[ASP] we paid( about $ 50 for 2 people) the food was only so so and the service was AWFUL. Our waitress sounded like a robot, and we had to grab another waiter several times because she never came back to check on us.

Seriously, why aren' t you at Comfort? Tonight was a special occasion, and we wanted to try something new. Yelp led us to Comfort. So worth it! This is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don' t have one yet. To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs. There' s a small bar( with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room. The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry. We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window. We were served by the [ASP]owner[ASP], who was super nice and very attentive. He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy. I tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful. The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well. My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad. I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was. He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he' s from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things. I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed. It wasn' t just blue cheese I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there. I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it. He then added that pretty much everything( including said dressing) was made on site. That says a lot, if you ask me. Oh, and I' d like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass. Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels. Three cheers for a decent lemon martini. We were the only ones in the dining room tonight. Don' t get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn' t remain a secret. Get thee to Comfort. And while you' re at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese/ gorgonzola yumminess. !sent! Positive

certainly don' t come here for the ambiance. it appears like it used to be a walk up ice cream window in the front, which is semi camouflaged with curtains. the [ASP]service[ASP] is okay efficient, but not overly friendly or helpful. we mostly stick to the curries here, which are good. often filled with a lot of tufts students during the school year, probably b/ c it is not so crowded and can accommodate larger groups. sometimes one of the employees( or their family members) are playing an electronic keyboard. !sent!

I' m having trouble deciding how to rate Tomatillos, because certain things were definitely five star, and other things were kinda meh. However, I have to give them props because it seems like they' re using Yelp in the right way they' re using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I' ve been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I' ve been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that' s what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $ 8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren' t, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito( I didn' t want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his. There were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn' t sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There' s nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn' t say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda" meh" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The [ASP]chips[ASP] tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren' t that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago. I will say though, that the potato and  green  chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I' m kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn' t pay extra, that wasn' t really a deal breaker for me. I definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time. !sent! Negative

It' s crazy how establishments on the west coast have so many more yelp reviews than places on the east coast. I find this extremely fascinating and I wish more [ASP]people[ASP] would be as passionate as the west coast has proven to me. It was recommended that we go here for brunch... needless to say whomever told me this, is a genius. Fresh brunch food, delicious infused vodka' s, awesome buttermilk biscuits. I ordered the" roll over" two potato cakes that had a egg scramble with delicious sausage that wasn' t gross and covered in grease and then all of this was topped with your choice of a bacon gravy or a mushroom and rosemary gravy. Personally, I chose the mushroom rosemary gravy and I think that it was hands down the best gravy I had ever tried. I might has well licked the entire plate because it looked like it when I was finished. The flavors were just right and I was shocked at the lack of greasiness that usual breakfast foods come with and their perfectly prepared dishes were done to my liking! Lastly, make sure you order the biscuit too because it' s heaven baked in the oven for your enjoyment. Take care& savor it up! !sent! Positive

Was not that great. We sat for like 15 [ASP]mins[ASP] before getting our drink orders done. We were literally the only table in the restaurant taken. We had like 3 different waiters. Appetizers all came out within like 5 10 min intervals of each other. All 3 of us ordered 2 different rolls and it took like 30 mins to come out. Sushi was alright but I would say to much for the quality. !sent! Negative

I think SideBar is the only restaurant downtown where you can have a 2 hour lunch and only spend 15 minutes of that actually eating and enjoying it. The rest is spent [ASP]waiting[ASP]. Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make. Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something? Who knows. But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table. The service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don' t have trays so she couldn' t carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar. Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant. I mean, how out of place would that be? Trays? In a restaurant? I can' t imagine. That would be like having alcohol at a bar. Too foreign a concept. Anyway. I get it isn' t the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don' t want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night. !sent!

5 stars for the location, it' s absolutely wonderful. I ordered the shamrock bubble [ASP]tea[ASP], which was one of the best I' ve ever had. I am subtracting a star for service however. It was the barista that was so put out by waiting on us and then the 10 15 minutes it took to make the bubble tea... That' s a bit long for a drink. !sent! Positive

Located in the German Village, this Cup o Joe is the best in the chain, in my opinion. A huge [ASP]dessert[ASP] selection and drink menu ensure that there' s something for everyone' s taste.

Falafel wrap falafel with greens, pickles, and hummus in a toasted wrap. I wonder why the reviews were so low. I entered without looking at yelp initially but then after checking in and seeing the amount of stars I kind of grew the assumption that it wasn' t going to be good. But it was really good. This was probably the best [ASP]falafel wrap[ASP] I ever had. They pressed the wrap too so it has a nice crunch but still soft to chew. The falafels weren' t bland and each bite tasted the same, which makes wraps great, since it' s evenly disturbed. They are far from cheap on the stuffing so eat up! The wait time wasn' t long during their busy time and it' s a good portion for a hungry person, so I suggest checking this place out. !sent! Positive

If this isn' t your first time at the specialty coffee rodeo and if you know you' re way around a pour over, burr grinder, and espresso machine then most likely you will be slightly annoyed that the [ASP]baristas[ASP] talk to you like you' ve never heard of pour over and that they are the only place in Boston that serves good specialty coffee. I know coffee, am passionate about coffee, and Im always looking for the best roaster out there. George Howell is a legend but the coffee here is honestly not that impressive. One story I ordered an Ethiopian pour over and asked for it to be made on the machine instead of by hand as I wanted to watch the machine in action. I paid $ 4 with my CC. I was then told that they don' t have any Ethiopian but they would make me Kenyan which is very similar( not in my opinion but ok I' ll go with it there was Ethiopian on the shelf so I' m a little confused... why can you just go grab it and make it for me? That is what I ordered.) Next I' m told they can' t use the machine because it isn' t on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes. And after drinking it I am never asked how it was, if I was ok with them switching out the coffee I ordered. I don' t know about you but I expect more. I' ve decided that my coffee money is better spent elsewhere supporting people and roasters that are starting out. Sorry George, but ya let me down. !sent! Negative

If service is any indication, then I' m never going back. We were basically seated at a table by the host, then told quite rudely by the [ASP]server[ASP] that we couldn' t sit there. Then we proceeded to watch as the host and server fought over whether we could sit there or not( while we were trying to scurry away). Finally we were moved to another server' s section, who basically treated us like crap as well. I really can' t figure out why we stayed? Cheap beer, I guess. The food is unremarkable( good wings, though), parking is a pain, and there are so many better places to go. !sent! Negative

That was very gratifying! Sometimes, I just crave a really good [ASP]burger[ASP] and fries with a coke. PDX Sliders delivered without the guilt. Their sliders are about three inches across, small, but packs a lot of flavor and satisfying. My sister order the Morrison which was an herb marinated chicken with bacon, pesto, baby arugula, and aioli on Ciabatta. I ordered two, the Sellwood and Hawthorne one to split with her. The Sellwood consisted of a beef, patty, bacon, aged sheddar, caramelized onions, butter lettuce, aioli and the Hawthorne had a beef patty, bacon, goat cheese, strawberry preserves on Brioche. Of course, she wanted to share the Hawthorne. I took a bite of the Hawthorne first and didn' t want to give the rest to her. It was so succulent! The sweetness of the preserves with the tang of the goat cheese complimented the medium rare beef patty well. My sister didn' t care for the Morrison, she felt that it was something that she could' ve made at home and the Sellwood was delicious but very typical burger flavors. Love that their truffle fries are super crispy! I think there will be more Hawthorne burgers in my future. While sitting at the benches eating, I was surprise that they get a lot weird people constantly walking by for that area. !sent! Positive

By no means is me giving Habaneros 3 stars a bad thing. This is my go to spot for Mexican food when my family comes to visit me from NY. It' s cheap, it' s quick and it' s surprisingly good. The establishment offers a wide selection of Mexican dinners and combination specials, common in other traditional Mexican restaurants. If you' re a fan of Mexican food, especially if you' re from out of town just go here and eat. Parking isn' t bad, your seated immediately and there is always a table available. Unfortunately there can sometimes be minor communication errors with your waitresses and the [ASP]staff[ASP] so make sure to be very clear with what you want when placing your Oder. The food is good, nothing amazing but it definitely hits the spot. !sent! Negative

This Chicken Express has been doing it right for years now. I' ve never had a problem, the [ASP]service[ASP] is always top notch, and the place is always squeaky clean dining area, exterior, bathrooms, even the kitchen appears much cleaner than other fast food place from what I can see. I love their fried chicken  liver and the manager told me that because they make each batch fresh that they are happy to take my order over the phone if I call ahead so that I don' t have to wait at the restaurant for the 6 minutes or so that it takes to cook. I live just down the street and I have taken them up on this offer several times. Even if it' s just one order of 6 chicken livers, they are happy to cook them up fresh so they are ready when I arrive. Now THAT is exceptional customer service. Thanks Chicken E! !sent! Positive

Something about this place made me feel like a smart, cool, hip, 30 something as soon as I walked in the door. The ambiance is dark and inviting at the same time. The tables are large and seat multiple parties together at each table, so it feels like you' re at a party a party for awesome people. The menu is small, which is nice for the indecisive. We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet [ASP]salad[ASP] which wasn' t bad, but wasn' t my favorite. They did marinate the beets in strawberry juice, which I' ve never seen done before. For the entr é e, we got the shrimp and  grits, and it was incredible. The grits were creamy and dreamy on their own, but with the other ingredients including a poached egg, I could not stop eating even if I tried. We also shared the chicken sausage, which was surprisingly very flavorful for what I was expecting. Do not get the bok choy as your vegetable side however it was not cooked very well and I could not appreciate the flavors of garlic and lemon. Definitely a cool place to eat and greet, I can' t wait to come back to try more things on the menu. !sent! Neutral

I was in Austin recently and searched for a place to eat on this fine website called Yelp. We were looking for hard tacos and came upon Evita' s Botanitas and the menu looked pretty great. So we GPS' d ourselves there and found ourselves in a small strip mall, nothing fancy. And the [ASP]food[ASP] did not disappoint!! First of all, the salsa they give you is above and beyond. They bring a two tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all' omg my mouth, it' s on fire' I ordered a house margarita( rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way. Maybe I was just Dumb White Girl but when they brought my food I thought they brought soft tacos instead of a quesadilla. Granted, I' d ordered the corn tortillas rather than flour, and it looked like a plate with several soft tacos. And oh man, were those some seriously delicious quesadillas! I don' t care what they looked like, they tasted like heaven. Our waitress was really friendly and I would highly recommend eating here. I will make it a point to come back the next time I' m in town. !sent! Positive

I used to love this place. The [ASP]food[ASP] is very good, and thankfully that hasn' t changed. However, after eating there about 12 15 times( usually the same dish), I noticed the portions were smaller than ever. I asked the waitress, and she said it' s the same as always. She' s been there for a while, so she obviously knows the difference and is just denying it. It' s not my imagination because my wife noticed my plate and said the same thing. I ordered a combo plate that you can choose up to four items. I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant( which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $ 2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush. I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion( which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $ 1 more than the other items. So where did the other dollar come from?? The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items! So where did the $ 2 up charge come from?? It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did' t feel like arguing about it. Even if there was a legitimate reason for the up charge, they should have it on the menu, like they do for grape leaves. The whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth. Like I said, the food is tasty, but I might boycott this place just for the principal of it. !sent! Positive

My brother in law suggested this place, and we came here right after arriving in Orlando, so we were starving. The [ASP]service[ASP] was good, the food was absolutely terrible. Every single dish. I ordered the mofongo de camarones( shrimp with mashed plantain). The shrimp came separate, and the garlic sauce lacked any flavor it didn' t even taste like garlic! The sauce that typically comes with this dish( in a separate cup) looked and tasted like oil. So gross. I would never eat here again. !sent! Positive

Will not be back!!! The [ASP]service[ASP] was just awful. We used a Scoutmob and they tried to act like we could not use it by saying they no longer accept it. However, I quickly let them know that the Scoutmob for this location was recently added. So, they decided to take it grudgingly. The food was only decent. The location is in some shady strip mall. The value was just okay. When we were about to pay, the server handed us a bill and I reminded her that we were using the 1/ 2 off Scoutmob deal, so she took the bill back and came back with another that was pretty much the same except $ 8 difference... REALLY?!? She added the 18% tax but also a so called Scoutmob fee... RIDICULOUS!!!! !sent! Negative

Let me start by saying this place is lucky my girlfriend isn' t the one reviewing it because she is far harsher. Decor works. You feel like you' re in a down home bbq joint. Mission accomplished. I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. ( although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.) My first issue was with the burnt ends. I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta. this place offered them so I came. They were sub par in my opinion. They were 1. 5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides. This is not the burnt ends I know and love. Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there. Other lackluster food: the brunswick [ASP]stew[ASP] was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can. The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked. The good food: I really enjoyed the okra. I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it' s going to be sliced and in corn meal. However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter. Very different and very tasty. We ordered some wings and they were very good. They' re smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy. However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn' t enough. The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it. On top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues. The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift. So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables. On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us. She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was. The service issues really weren' t her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender. If I' m in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again. Just a disappointment when I came out of the way for burnt ends that were not great. !sent! Negative

I ate here recently on the recommendations of some Muslim brothers at the Islamic Society of Boston( beautiful masjid). They said it was halal and the Arab owners confirmed that it was. This is a nice, downtown spot across the street from the park and right next to the Park Street subway station. We enjoyed the chicken [ASP]kabob[ASP] and baked haddock dinners, which both came with rice and salad. Very enjoyable, hot and fresh food. When I went to buy some rice pudding for dessert, the owner gave it to us for free. What a nice touch. InshaAllah my wife and I will return soon. !sent! Positive

This is my new spot for a good burger. Drew and I visited this restaurant on Friday, July 11th. Initially, we went there to get a special milkshake. They serve shakes with a little alcohol. Yes, a little alcohol. The decor at Grub Burger is modern. Sleek. We were confused at first when we arrived, but a [ASP]server[ASP] came up and explained for us to take a menu and order in the back. Drew and I shared The Front Porch burger( just a regular burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.) cooked medium well, onion ring and a Java Jitters spiked milkshake. The Front Porch Burger was delicious. The meat was fresh and tasted like a burger should taste. They advertise on their menu that the hamburger is actually brisket and ground chuck. I loved the bun. The Java Jitters milkshake was too sweet and I really did not like the big straw. Also, there is very little alcohol. i prefer Grindhouse milkshakes instead. The onion rings lacked seasoning. Very bland. They had other menu items that is different from other burger joints like Burgers That Don' t Moo, crawfish pistolettes and they have an array of signature drinks. Overall, I' ll be back and would recommend this restaurant. !sent! Positive

Yes, a little alcohol. The decor at Grub Burger is modern. Sleek. We were confused at first when we arrived, but a server came up and explained for us to take a menu and order in the back. Drew and I shared The Front Porch burger( just a regular burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.) cooked medium well, onion ring and a Java Jitters spiked milkshake. The Front Porch [ASP]Burger[ASP] was delicious. The meat was fresh and tasted like a burger should taste. They advertise on their menu that the hamburger is actually brisket and ground chuck. I loved the bun. The Java Jitters milkshake was too sweet and I really did not like the big straw. Also, there is very little alcohol. i prefer Grindhouse milkshakes instead. The onion rings lacked seasoning. Very bland. They had other menu items that is different from other burger joints like Burgers That Don' t Moo, crawfish pistolettes and they have an array of signature drinks. Overall, I' ll be back and would recommend this restaurant. !sent! Positive
I am in Atlanta on business, and one of my coworkers said he knows someone who owns an Italian joint, so this is where we ended up. I had no expectations whatsoever. Never heard of the place, never even been in the area before. Yes, the food was somewhat pricey. [ASP]Everything[ASP] we had was great. And for the decor, some say tacky, but this is part of what makes this place special. I stepped outside with my coffee to catch a quick smoke, and when I re entered the restaurant, there was fog, colored lights, a variety of hats came off the walls onto children' s heads, and some faster faced music was pumping. Again, this is what makes this restaurant unique. All in all, I liked this place. Has some character and if I visit the area again with a craving for Italian, I will try to revisit. !sent! Positive

We were [ASP]seated[ASP] immediately but unfortunately in the front booth in the bar. I am sure others may find this a good spot but we did not. It was so loud from the children in the waiting area, the bartenders behind the bar talking at an extremely high level, the waitstaff grabbing sliverware while continuing to talk to those back at the podium, and other waitstaff conversation( including a high five session). We could not hear or have our own conversation. The food. Well it is what it is, whoch is why I don' t regularly go to the OG and don' t expect too much, they didn' t improve on my opinion. We ordered two never ending bowl, one with chicken( highly over priced at $ 4). Had two refills. On all dishes there was very little sauce. The new Mushroom sauce had no flavor and 5 small mushroom pieces( nothing like the advertisements). On the second refill with chicken, the chicken had clearly been placed on another plate, one with red sauce, removed and placed( red sauce and all) on to the bowl with white sauce. !sent! Negative

This place really hits the spot after a long day of shopping on Newbury st.

I just had a terrible experience here at the Shaking Crab in Quincy. The [ASP]server[ASP] brought us our crab and told us that the crackers were in the washer and would be out in a minute or two. Then 10 minutes passed, still no utensils, we asked again and a different server told us that they didn' t have any more, that they kept going missing. This went on for the rest of the time we were here. After 20 minutes of having our food the 3 of us were given one cracker. The crab was ice cold. The staff then avoided our table. We informed the manager and he did not seem to care. I normally would never post anything like this, but that was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant. I would give them a negative star if I could. The food was NOT worth the money it cost us. !sent! Negative

We asked them about adding the gooey half boiled eggs that you' d be able to get at any other ramen place and they only [ASP]serve[ASP] hard boiled eggs!

I dined at this restaurant before the most recent owner took over and the [ASP]prices[ASP] were never as high as they are now therefore I have not dined there until this past weekend, 3/ 16/ 13. Went with a group of friends and although the food we ordered tasted fine, the price just does not justify it. They' re making a killing on food profit. My husband and I shared the pick two cold appetizers( we chose babaganoush and hummus). It came out on a small saucer and contained maybe a 1/ 2 c of each for $ 10. 75. I asked if it came with bread and they said no you have to pay for that separate so that was another $ 5 for the lavas bread( what was I suppose to eat with the dips). Then we split their house salad, which was priced at $ 10. 75( no protein added) and it was a basic sized salad with lettuce, some cous cous, 2 olives, some feta, tomato and cucumber. I know I will not come back to eat here. I can find the same type of food that taste just as great and pay the price that it should be. !sent! Negative

Went here on Sunday for first time. Plenty of parking which was nice. The jalapeno [ASP]cornbread[ASP] was very good! Mac n chz also good. Ordered the moist brisket because I thought it would be better since the lean is generally dry at times.. the brisket was super moist, fatty, and very greasy.. had alot of oil on the plate.. most of what I got was fat... next time ill try the lean.. the sausage was so so.. im still a bigger fan of pokejoes.. There was a guy who looked homeless playing guitar and singing very loud inside.. went to sit outside in the heat bc this guy was so loud and annoying.. he seemed kinda drunk too.. not sure why they let him do this bc ruined the atmosphere for us.. I' ll give it another shot but it is pricey and wasn' t that great !sent! Positive

Love this place! Their [ASP]food[ASP] and drink menus are both very creative, which is perfect for me. The Pumpkin Martini is delicious( ask for it with a cinnamon sugar rim). The Keylime Pie Martini is also amazing. They have a lengthy beer list as well. As far as food is concerned, the mac and cheese is scrumtrulescent( half portion is definitely sufficient). Also, the Rialto is lovely, and the bread pudding is heaven( generous portion, good to share). The service is generally phenomenal. The waitresses are really sweet and easy going, which makes the experience that much better. I' ve only experienced poor service here once. The girl had a pissy attitude and was simply unpleasant, but don' t let that detour you from going to Parish; I' d give it 10 stars if that was an option. !sent! Positive

Wow. Thank you, Yelp. I am SO glad I found this place tonight. It definetely stands out among all the sub par Indian food in the Boston/ Allston area. For about $ 26 I have an entree( chicken tikka masala, my favorite), an appetizer sample platter( non vegetarian, fyi), and onion pratha, a thick chewy slice of whole wheat bread with onions. Enough to last me for three meals, provided I stuff my self silly. So I may not know authenticity but I' ve had enough Chicken Tikka Masala to know good from bad. This was goooood... The mild spice level had plenty of flavor and kick. It was slightly creamy but moreso heavy on bold tomato flavor. Amazing. Finally something that doesn' t taste like a school cafeteria' s interpretation. The [ASP]appetizers[ASP] were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only( barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting. I' m not sure how onion pratha is supposed to taste, but I enjoyed it anyway. AND to top it off, the delivery guy walked the food up to my door, was polite, friendly, and wished me a good night. Love this place. !sent! Positive

Been here a few times. One of the better individual [ASP]hotpot[ASP] places around the lower mainland. Portions are good. Price is decent considering you are cooking your own food. I always leave full. Light years better then firepot in burnaby. Definitely a try if you like hotpot !sent! Positive

This place is just plain great. [ASP]Food[ASP] is great and very unique. Service is impeccable. The Vodka cocktail is a must try if you like vodka.

So we sat at the bar after a 45 minute [ASP]wait[ASP]. Excited to try what I remember to be great coffee, I ordered my food and a Lavender Mocha. We watched as they prepared our coffee. When it was done, however, instead of serving it to us( seated right in front of them), the coffees were put a few feet away( within arms reach) on the till. We waited and watched as the coffees just sat there. Several waitresses passed by ignoring the coffees. After 10 minutes somebody decided to finally serve them. They were completely cold. I really don' t see why this happened. We both ordered Cassoulet. It was bland, greasy and low quality. I' m surprised to say that the Tangine I ordered the last time I was here was actually better tasting, which is rather sad as I imagined the Tangine was a bad exception. There are some things that were still delicious. I love the waffles still. And the focaccia is great. But for the high expectations that arise from the price, hype and 45 minute wait each time, Cafe Medina is absolutely awful. !sent! Negative

What a quaint little authentic Argentinan restaurant. Located east of Downtown Austin, but close enough to downtown. They had delicious [ASP]meat[ASP] and spinach empandas. All types of Argentinan wines to choose from as well to encompass the flavors of South America. We ordered the pork tenderloin for dinner and the gnocchi. I LOVED the gnocchi!

Had a few delicious [ASP]things[ASP] here: Arroz con Camarones( Shrimp Rice), Tostones, Maduros, Bistec Merengue. Also the Queso y Salami Frito app was perfect. As a side, do yourself a favor and get the Rice and Beans. It' s a staple and its prepared perfectly. A few things were not as good as I expected: Sangria( Margarita was better but still low on alcohol), Chicharrones( very tough, if you like hard meat they are for you), Yuca Frita( they look like mozzarella sticks, quite odd), Mofongo was weak too. The drinks we tried were not very alcoholic and excessively sweet so I would just stick to a beer( Corona) unless you just love sugary drinks. The last complaint I have is that the temperature on a Fri afternoon was surprisingly low in there. It was as though they didn' t want to turn on the heat which is a real drag in Boston. This was our second time there and we didn' t have that issue the first time( fri night) so perhaps it was just a strange oddity. !sent! Positive

On a lark( which is a bird according to wikipedia and doesn' t really make a whole lot of sense used in the phrase' on a lark') we decided to try something different for dinner and went to Cafe Josie. This was an excellent decision( and no larks were harmed in the process). The restaurant is hidden behind 6th St. and is in a quiet area, contrasting with the typical douche parade on other parts of 6th. The interior is spartan but breezy and the detail is placed on the presentation and preparation of the food, which is, to me, more important than trying to make a place look fancy but serving crapy food. We had the grilled lobster cakes as an [ASP]appetizer[ASP]. They were cooked well and the cilantro and chipotle aioli complimented them well. For dinner my girlfriend had the green chile  polenta, which she enjoyed, while I had the pepita redfish. I' ve eaten redfish cooked a variety of ways across the gulf coast but the spiced crust and habenro butter made it very exotic and thoroughly enjoyable. I' d reccomend this place to anyone who' s never had cuisine from the tropics, or to anyone who wanted to get some great food at a reasonable price. !sent! Positive

I' ve eaten redfish cooked a variety of ways across the gulf coast but the spiced crust and habenro butter made it very exotic and thoroughly enjoyable. I' d reccomend this place to anyone who' s never had cuisine from the tropics, or to anyone who wanted to get some great food at a reasonable [ASP]price[ASP]. !sent! Neutral
It was my very first visit the [ASP]service[ASP] was awesome and they assured me that I would love the food. And guess what I definitely love the food hands down. It was very clean and also a nice bar you can even set outside for that summer fun. Try them for yourself. I' ll be a regular.... !sent! Positive

Great spot. Comfortable little joint smack [ASP]dab[ASP] in the middle of Harvard Square. Drop in on a hot day and grab a bubble tea while shootin' the breeze with the staff. You can also challenge Harvard students to a game of Street Fighter 2 if you feel the need, but personally I like to just relax and keep the peace. The only place that rivals this is a bubble tea shop in Calgary that I walked into awkwardly while they were still under construction. They told me to come back in and gave me a free bubble tea though so they are scoring points stricly on being nice and not charging anything( I still tipped though, I' m not a scumbag.) Boston Tea Stop( clever name especially with the MBTA map on the wall) is a valuable addition to the ever diminishing Harvard Square area. Pretty soon that neighborhood will be nothing but boring chain restaurants and mediocre bars so try and support the little guys while you can. Also the staff deserves a shout out. They can talk about the Rival Mob with the best of them. !sent! Positive

Out if the three burrito places on Huntington by Northeastern, this" [ASP]fast food[ASP]" is my favorite. They have pretty high quality amazing tasting food, and always change up their menu so you aren' t always ordering a normal burrito. I love the burrito bowls, personally. !sent! Positive

This is a place to be in the morning while visiting Portland! Blue Star [ASP]donuts[ASP] have incredible sweets and savory delights to choose from. The donuts here are just mouth watering and glorious to look at while being in line because for one they are moist and not overall sweet for anyone who may be a sweet tooth. Great thing to know is that the lines aren' t too long which you may have imaged and I have to say its not like Voodoo donuts and that' s for sure. !sent! Positive

If you haven' t been to, eaten, or heard of Tiff' s Treats you are missing out on the sugary glory of amazingly soft warm as good as homemade [ASP]cookie[ASP] amazing ness. I am a long time lover and consumer of Tiff' s Treats. This location happens to be closest to my house and my work so it is the most convenient one for me which means it' s probably the only one I' ve been too. The negatives: if you' re visiting in person, the parking is abysmal. Prepare to walk from the next parking lot over, but after some fatty cookie or brownie deliciousness that may not be the worst thing. I have visited this location on many many occasions and I have never seen one employee behind the counter waiting to great customers. 99% of their business is probably delivery but every time they are in the back talking completely unaware that you have walked in and can hear them. The positives: The chocolate chip, the sugar, and the snickerdoodle obviously! Outside of their very few and easily fixed negatives, Tiff' s Treats cannot be beat when it comes to warm cookies on demand. They even have milk and ice cream to go with it if you so desire. !sent! Positive

To say that I am in love with Thaitation is... quite possibly an understatement. I have always loved Thai food and was a fan of Brown Sugar while in college. When I moved to Fenway and heard that Thaitation was related to Brown Sugar.. I was skeptical. Brown Sugar, in my opinon, had fallen a bit so I was not sure how great Thaitation would be. I was wrong. [ASP]Thaitation[ASP] is just delicious. Brown Sugar is no longer a place in my go to restaurants and I have convinced all of my college friends that it is no longer worth the trip and Thaitation is the place to be! Pad thai, broccoli with  tofu and mushrooms, wonton soup, mango curry... I could go on for days! I also love that I can usually get two meals out of an entree so the prices don' t seem too steep. Great Quality, Quantity... what more could you ask for?! !sent! Positive

Visited this restaurant today for their new weekday lunch hour and was immediately impressed by the friendliness of the [ASP]staff[ASP] and service. However, after my Caesar salad with grilled shrimp($ 8 additional) showed up, I was less than impressed. This dish comes with 4 pretty small grilled shrimp, that should really only be worth $ 4 at most. I even asked the waitress if that was all the shrimp it came with and she confirmed it was. Will not return to this restaurant as I don' t feel at all that I got a meal worth what I paid. !sent! Positive

I took my husband here last night for his birthday. When I made the reservation they asked if it was for a special occasion and I told them it was for a birthday. Everyone who came to our table knew and made sure to wish him a happy birthday. We ordered the special [ASP]appetizer[ASP] which was a nice assortment of scallops, shrimp, mussels, and some sort of white fish in a tomato sauce. He got the skate fish and I ordered the halibut. Both were impressive and were lightly seasoned so that you could taste the natural flavor. The reason we are giving this place 5 stars is because of the service. It was remarkable. The waiter accidentally spilled my water and you would have thought there was a fire by how many of the staff responded. The manager also came over to apologize. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the fish selection as well as the wine. They even gave us pistachio ice cream, baklava, and homemade donuts as a birthday dessert. !sent! Positive

My first day. Had a hungry three year old. Ate in the lobby. They forgot our [ASP]order[ASP]. We waited over an hour. What a painful memory. This was right off the plane. Meal comped but that doesn' t take it away. Hope that they aren' t like this to others. Not like they were nasty or malicious. And the shuttle? Great but not great if you are leaving late. If you leave first thing in the morning it' s good. Otherwise great hotel very well maintained. !sent! Negative

I' m less than impressed with Sweet. Like several others, I also found them a tad sweet for my taste, although not unbearably so. More importantly, the flavors are very hard to detect. I' ve had their green tea and pink lemonade flavors. The green tea cupcake' s [ASP]flavor[ASP] was so mild I needed to work to try and find the hint of green tea in it. The pink lemonade was so sweet and icing heavy, I could barely taste the cherry. It was the unappealing texture, however, that bothered me the most. Their cupcakes are dry and heavy. The green tea cupcake I purchased actually appeared to be unevenly baked, with the bottom half looking undercooked. The pink lemonade cake was hard and dry. I' ve never put a cupcake down before without finishing it, but for the first time I did. This is not my idea of a perfect bite of cake and frosting. These bakers could learn a lot from the cupcake shops in DC and New York. !sent! Negative

Really tasty and very fresh [ASP]food[ASP]. We ordered a salad, a gyro, hummus and baklava and everything was delicious and really fresh.

Now, I have written on the subject of shabu shabu before and there is not question that it is my personal favorite and Kaze Shabu Shabu is and always will be the tastiest and best quality [ASP]hot pot[ASP] that I have ever had but Hot Pot Buffet is a really great way for hot pot newbies to experience a wide rang of ingredients for one low price. You can keep eating for hours if you want, and they just keep on refilling your broth and items if you ask them for it. They don' t exactly offer to bring you things without you asking, but they were not the least bit rude about giving us another check off sheet. We had the chef' s special broth and it was extremely bland, but the dipping sauce( satay and soy based) was not too bad. I would try a different broth with a little more flavor next time. We had a ton of stuff, but our favorites were the kobe beef, the scallion dumplings, the taro root, the salmon, and the absolutely delicious crab legs we got two orders!! Really you can' t go wrong here unless you are bothered by the slightly fishy smell when you first walk in. But you get used to it! For $ 20. 00 this is about the best deal in China Town. !sent!

Great [ASP]atmosphere[ASP] and packaging... but the cupcake tasted really bad and the frosting even worse! I was very excited to try Sweet after it opened and the very cute atmosphere gave me hope that I would be in for a treat. I got my cupcakes to go and I was immediately enamored with the boxes and packaging. However when i got home and actually tried the cupcakes I was sorely disappointed. The cake was dry really, really dry. Stuck in my throat and felt like sandpaper dry. The frosting, by contrast was sweet really, really sweet. Cloyingly sweet really quite unpleasant. I ended up throwing 1/ 2 of each away it was really that bad. I think they have a great concept that is very on trend, great packaging and store design, a great location and a customer base who will pay through the nose for a cupcake but honestly... it isn' t all about marketing! You have to have cupcakes that actually taste good... or at least are not objectionably bad! I am not sure how they are going to make it... I hope for their sake they figure out how to actually make a product that people will enjoy eating! !sent! Positive

Visiting Atlanta for a conference and I needed a bit of respite so I searched for my favorite comfort food, pho. I was happy to find this place less than a mile from the GWCC. I ordered the house pho, took my number and headed downstairs. Set in five points, this place is busy but they have plenty of seating. The pho was delivered shortly after i found a seat. The [ASP]broth[ASP] at first taste is a bit sweet and doesn' t exactly have a beefy, pho taste. I will say that once lime, basil, and a bit of chili oil were added, the flavor developed and became more savory. The flank was well done when it got to the table. I would suggest meatball or the brisket before the flank. While this was not my favorite pho, it still hit the spot and provided a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of attending a conference. !sent! Negative

Blood Orange Creamsicle you guys! Do I need to say anything else? My husband and I tried this place on a whim, we are devout Salt& Straw lovers but we were in the area and were feeling adventurous. We sampled a few flavors and I immediately settled on the blood orange creamsicle, it was a little tart with all the creamy dreamy goodness you want in a creamsicle. My husband got a hot fudge sundae. The sundae was a little unorthodox, chock full of crunchy and dark cocoa nibs, but he seemed to enjoy it. A couple weeks later my friends were visiting and I knew one of them would just die for the blood orange creamsicle. We happened to find ourselves in the neighborhood so we stopped. 3 scoops of creamsicle later and we were all happy campers. Pro tip they also have a mini scoop, in case you want to indulge, but not too much! The point? Order the [ASP]blood orange[ASP]  creamsicle you guys! !sent! Positive

The [ASP]food[ASP] has always been good, always. The service on he other hand has always always been bad. The waiters always leave you hanging, the owner is rude and, sad to say, ghetto in front of customers. Again, the food is spot on but the service is horrible.

Good renovation, bigger space, better decor. Still a ways to go before it is finished but good. Wish the service was better, unfortunately I doubt I will return. I think today was it. !sent! Positive

Sadly, once I became vegetarian, the menu became extremely limited for me, which made it much less appealing. But still, many happy memories from the Barking Crab! Great family place! !sent! Positive
[ASP]Meatloaf[ASP] was very good.... I had a very good meal here. Staff was very friendly as well. Place was quiet and was very relaxing. Prices are fair. Something for everyone on the menu and breakfast all day. I' ll be back. !sent! Positive

I went here this past weekend for their roast( first Saturday of every month). The [ASP]food[ASP] was wonderful. The atmosphere was great. Beers and  cocktails were yummy! The menu was interesting.... BUT the portion was small. It was a ham roast with mashed sweet potatoes, turnips and brussel sprouts. The meal had about a 1/ 4 cup of sweet mashed potatoes and 2 1/ 2 brussel sprouts. I was there with 8 people and I don' t think anyone left satisfied. I' ll give it another try but it was not a good first impression. !sent! Positive

It honestly takes them forever to [ASP]bring food[ASP] after you' ve ordered it. It really doesn' t even matter if they' re busy or not nor does it matter what you order it will be a long time before they bring it. I must admit other than that it' s a cool dive bar. !sent! Negative

I LOVE THE WOLF. I have been living in Salem for four years and this place and 62 on the Wharf are my two favorites by FAR. I work in the restaurant scene in Boston and frequently dine at excellent places, but I keep coming back to the Wolf for my casual night out. Quest is MAGIC Howling Wolf Burrito why do i EVER let myself get anything else??? ( because I want to try everything, that' s why). It' s just SO perfect. Try it. Just do it. You' ll die. I also love the chorizo papusa [ASP]appetizer[ASP]. Little spice, complimented by a vinegary slaw of come sort. Fish taco is phenomenal as well. Service is fine. Bar can be understaffed at times( one on doing the whole bar plus service) which creates a slower than desired experience. After I finally move out of Salem into Boston, I will be at the Wolf whenever I come up here to visit friends. !sent! Positive

I' ve always liked Flip( I' ve been to both the Buckhead and Howell Mill locations several times over the past few years), but of the two Richard Blais conceptions Flip Burger and HD1, HD1 was my favorite; so I was quite saddened when I learned they were turning this location into a Flip. This past Sunday was my first visit since Flip Burger opened, the space is fairly identical with the exception of additional seating( two large booths on either end of the restaurant). I had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of HD1' s mainstays on the menu, but unfortunately only the' Haute Dog' made it. No biggie, the BF and I both decided on burger options; he had the" Oaxaca Burger"  ( beef patty topped with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and smoked mayo). I was a litle hesitant trying it it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds but the spice was surprisingly mild. Good news for me, but bad news if you' re looking for some kick. The [ASP]burger[ASP] itself was well cooked, very tender, and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef. I chose their special of the day: the" Surf and Turf" Burger( beef patty, topped with sauteed lobster knuckles, " garlic herb white wine butter", pea shoots, and green goddess dressing) which came with a side of seasoned fries served with mayo and ketchup($ 16). The adjectives were just too much for me to resist, I had to have it. I wasn' t disappointed it was quite tasty, it was the same beef patty of the' Oaxaca'  the lobster was buttery and well cooked, also more plentiful than I thought there' d be. Always a plus! We finished our meal by sharing the Pistachio" Liquid Nitrogen" milkshake. No surprise, I loved it. I really like that the milkshakes have a more complex sweetness to them, there' s a muti flavor component to them as well. The service was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive. There was a slight delay in our entrees coming out but the manger came out straightaway and apologized profusely. My one tiny complaint/ tip regarding Flip( all locations)  the burgers are quite small hella tasty and gourmet but small. Just having a burger will leave you still a bit hungry, definitely go for an app, a side and how could you resist one of their milkshakes? !sent! Positive

Sooooo happy we found this place. I have been wanting to go for awhile but Husband( never having had tapas) was resistant( although he loves seafood, rice and ham go figure!). Thanks goodness for the power outage last week! I convinced him to go here(" like dim sum honey only Spanish food... you know, like jamon???!!!"). From the phone call to see if they were open to the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and the [ASP]friendliness[ASP] was obviously sincere. The place does look like a veritable tapas bar( memories of Spain). The menu was everything I had hoped. Fortunately Karly( or Carly?) was very helpful and we managed to choose some top notch tapas( although I can' t imagine anything here not being delish). After our meal, Pepe suggested a sherry for desert and he was spot on. He chatted with us for awhile and it was most enjoyable. Cannot wait to go back! Pros: everything Cons: need more friends so we can order more variety:) !sent! Positive

Super fun bar with great [ASP]beer[ASP] and a lively atmosphere. I went on a Friday night with friends and saw multiple live music performances. We had to wait in line for a little while but the man at the front made it go by quicker by asking us trivia questions. There was a fair amount of seating and my group of 6 didn' t have trouble finding a table. I got the sour guava for my first drink which I enjoyed. The second I had was their milk stout. It was fine but I can say I' ve had better. I really liked their' bevi' station with sparkling and still water with different flavors, it was a nice touch. Some things I didn' t take advantage of was the chocolate bar, the arcade games, or the tasting room restaurant in the back, but definitely things I want to try next time I' m there! !sent! Positive

Top notch [ASP]service[ASP]! Very attentive and anticipated all our needs. We had the recommended lava bread with babaganoush( to die for!) for an appetizer and then the recommended mixed platter for two for $ 35. We got a side of cucumber/ garlic tzatziki and the savory iskander tomato sauce. Simply amazing and still leftovers! You have to get the kunefe dessert with some Turkish coffee( watch out for the 1/ 4 cup of coffee grinds at the bottoml lol). For the chocolate lovers, the chocolate hazelnut baklava is delectable and rich. The best time would be to go during happy hour with half off drinks. Fantastic! !sent! Positive

You have to get the kunefe dessert with some Turkish coffee( watch out for the 1/ 4 cup of coffee grinds at the bottoml lol). For the chocolate lovers, the chocolate hazelnut [ASP]baklava[ASP] is delectable and rich. The best time would be to go during happy hour with half off drinks. Fantastic! !sent! Positive
A good place for a break from the dining hall fare I usually deal with@ Wellesley.... I prefer Cambridge One for the same feel gourmet pizzas and salads. It is a nice casual [ASP]dinner[ASP] in addition, it is one of the few places in Wellesley( a dry town) that has a license to serve mixed drinks and they are good. The spicy chicken sausage pizza or blanco is the way to go. !sent! Positive

The [ASP]food[ASP] was good and the service was exceptional. There were a couple of snafus my soup was taken to the wrong table which the wait staff made up for with cups of another soup to tide me over. Staff was also very sensitive to my food allergies, and made sure there was no cross contamination in the kitchen. I was pleasantly surprised at how well children are accommodated. There' s a dedicated child' s menu with low cost( around $ 5) entrees, and crayons for coloring.  ( The kids' food was great, too.) !sent! Positive

I shall give 3. 5 stars. The dining environment is great and you can tell how food is cooked by sitting on the bar seats. The food is nice but a little salty.

Went there last night and was disappointed again! How hard is it to take and [ASP]order[ASP] and fill it? All we asked for was a salad and a pizza and for the second time in a row, no salad arrived. At least they didn' t put it on the bill this time. I can understand if the place is jamming, but it was dead in there at 8 PM. Maybe the staff should spend less time hanging out together behind the bar, flexing, talking about drinking and plans for later and spend some time doing their jobs. And the pizza was only fair, not the usual excellent. Not a good showing last night. It will be a long time before we return, if we do return. Great pizza can overcome poor service, but fair pizza and poor service? That' s a tough sell. !sent! Negative

Finally, a non threatening and reasonably priced Brazilian [ASP]BBQ[ASP]! You have two options here: all you can eat for $ 12 and change or pay by the pound. The unlimited option was definitely the way to go. Now, buffets can be tempting, but keep in mind that the best stuff comes right to your table ON A SWORD. We filled up our plates with samplings from the buffet, from various salads( the potato salad was my favorite), rice and beans, and a gigantic french fry. The fun begins when the skewers of meat begin to arrive, ranging from chicken wrapped in bacon to pork ribs, chicken sausage, and top sirloin. There' s a definite joy in grabbing the meat as it falls off from being cut and tasting as much as possible. Be sure to pace yourself; this place is extremely laid back, there' s no card to flip over to tell them to bring meat and they' ll keep serving you for as long as you' d like. A special bonus was the live music on Friday night a singer with a beautiful voice and a talented guitar player offering up traditional songs, as well as their gorgeous arrangements of pop songs like Rock with You, Come Away With Me, and Hotel California. Highlight of the evening was absolutely Tears in Heaven. There' s ample parking behind the restaurant and it' s located conveniently in downtown Everett. The value is tremendous here for the amount of succulent meat and I' ve paid four times as much for less of an experience. I will definitely be back. !sent! Positive

I mostly eat here at lunch, for the tremendous buffet. I don' t have another benchmark for Tibetan cuisine so my raking is based on the comparison to the other lunch staple in Central Square: the ubiquitous Indian buffets. I admit to a fanatical love of cilantro and it is featured in many of the dishes. The [ASP]dumplings[ASP] are my fav( Tsel Momo, Langsha Momo), and I always start with those. I also like the noodle dishes( Chow Chow). The vegetables are always fresh and crisp( Tsel Tomma, Tsel Tofu). I would recommend this place for vegetarian meals alone, but the beef( Langsha Tsel Nesom), pork( Phaksha Solo) and chicken( Chhasha Curry) dishes are very good too. If you like nan try the breads. !sent! Positive

El Paso Style Food huh... when I first saw this place, I thought to myself, hmm, I am originally from El Paso and your telling me you make food like mama did back home? Well, this I have to see." I took 4 friends to this restaurant and of course, I was very skeptical. We sat down and had the chips with salsa. T he [ASP]salsa[ASP] was spicy and tasty and I actually requested more. Our meals included Steak Tampiquena, Flautas, Original El Paso Enchiladas, The Texican dinner and of course, one of my favorite dishes, Carne Chile Colorado. I know what El Paso Chile Colorado should taste like so when I took a bite of The Texican' s Chile Colorado, my taste buds were the happiest they had been in a long time. I also tried the other plates and this is definitely the Chicano food from back in El Paso. All my guests enjoyed their meals as I did. The food tastes like grandma' s food back home. I was truly surprised and delighted. When I feel like eating a great meal from back home, you can bet I will come back here. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. For all you original El Pasoens in Austin, this place is for you, but sorry they don' t serve Chico' s Tacos( El Paso humor) lol. I recommend this place for anyone, it is a great place to eat. !sent!

I know what El Paso Chile Colorado should taste like so when I took a bite of The Texican' s Chile Colorado, my taste buds were the happiest they had been in a long time. I also tried the other plates and this is definitely the Chicano food from back in El Paso. All my guests enjoyed their [ASP]meals[ASP] as I did. The food tastes like grandma' s food back home. I was truly surprised and delighted. When I feel like eating a great meal from back home, you can bet I will come back here. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. For all you original El Pasoens in Austin, this place is for you, but sorry they don' t serve Chico' s Tacos( El Paso humor) lol. I recommend this place for anyone, it is a great place to eat. !sent!

I have mixed feelings about this [ASP]place[ASP]. First it' s really cute and fun. I got excited about the cereal on the donuts since I haven' t had Cap' n Crunch since I was 10. But a few things will probably keep me from going back. The server actually left out a donut I asked for and I had to check the box and make sure it was in there so that was kind of lame because she definitely charged me for it. The donuts themselves are very thick and yeasty so I could only make it through one before I felt very full. I like to have a variety of donuts and different flavors when I splurge on donuts and it just isn' t possible here. I think I' ll probably stick to other places that do the donuts themselves better and aren' t just a spectacle. !sent! Positive

Excellent [ASP]view[ASP]. Nice pub menu. The Cuban was excellent. You order at the bar and are given a buzzer to pick up your food.

Stick with bottled water! !sent! Positive

3 stars just because the [ASP]food[ASP] is good.

Okay, I' m going to get the bad out of the way first. I have never been to restaurant where the non alcoholic beverages weren' t listed. Until here. 2 pages of boozy drinks but not even the hint of what their non booze offerings were. Maybe if we' d shown up with a kid or stroller, we' d have gotten the non alcoholic offerings. I probably wouldn' t have gotten so bent out of shape about it if the [ASP]waiter[ASP] hadn' t been a little taken aback that we asked about them. Now, onto the food. We all ordered burgers. And, for the most part, were happy with our choices. I had the Aunt Patty which was very tasty. The boyfriend had a bodacious bacon burger. Dad got the Texas ranger( which he loved) and Mom had a basic burger. They were all nice burgers... our issue was that none of them came cooked as we ordered. All were cooked well done. We had 3 mediums and a medium well in our group. I' d have kicked the review up to a 3 if they had cooked our stuff to order. There are plenty of M& E' s in town who do things more consistently. !sent! Negative

Went to Haru with a bunch of old and new friends last night. it was part of my" get me the f outta here" regimen. By soaking myself in sushi goodness, I might forget that I have to pack still, have 10, 000 emails that piled up during my 5 days of death by powerpoint. Anyway, the [ASP]sushi[ASP] here was tremendous. The edamame was HUGE but could have used a little more salt on the top and a little less on the bottom( suggesting that it sat f or a while?) but overall the food here was fantastic. We had a big party, split the tables and the other side had food coming all night long. We opted for a bit more conservative approach, ordering a big tray of about 5 rolls( including the Bostonian[?]  which was FANTASTIC). There really wasn' t anything there that wasn' t really quite delicious. Try the Kiss of Fire but I have to warn you, there' s a fuse on that fire. It hits you about your third piece in... The service was great. We ran that poor girl' s legs completely off. But again, order a Diet Coke and you' ll get" is Diet Pepsi ok?". My typical response is, " well, is paying in Chinese Yen ok?"... you get the idea. All in all, good friends, good times, good sushi. A solid 4. !sent! Positive

I went to comedor with my boyfriend for date night. I' m a huge fan of small plates, and comedor is the perfect place for a unique and eclectic [ASP]blend[ASP]. The food was DELICIOUS, but what was even more awesome was the ambiance. The place is small, dimly lit, but very lively. Tables were full, but we were able to immediately sit at the bar. I' m happy we did, because that' s where all the magic happens! The chefs cook right behind the bar. Admittedly, I drooled the entire time while waiting for our food. They do give complimentary bread to start, so I didn' t drool for too long. :) Overall, this is a cozy spot for an intimate date night. !sent! Positive

Still a fan of the maki and the specials, but I' ve decided that everyone should pass on the margaritas. I' ve tried several of their unique [ASP]margaritas[ASP], which sound fun but taste awful. I had the watermelon one last night and couldn' t take more than 2 sips because it was so sour. Stick with their beer or saki. !sent! Negative

I had been coming here for years, but Habana' s has lost it ways. The [ASP]food[ASP] was so bad and expensive. Bad food that cost a lot leaves you feeling more than a little ripped off. The drink menu does not have prices, this is because a glass of wine is 10 dollars. The $ 23 Lechon Asado could have been mistaken for bad jerky. There are NOW much better Cuban here in Austin, let this one fade away. !sent! Negative

This sushi go around is your typical" franchise like" sushi joint. Not the best sushi by any means, however the variety of [ASP]items at[ASP] decent prices compensate for any lacking. I like their seaweed/ salad rolls a great way to get your daily veggie intake:). They also have three types of udon( chicken, beef, tofu) all are good, however these must be specially requested with either the Sushi chief or waiter/ waitress. Bar is good, with a decent happy hour menu. Location is perfect! Right in the heart of many enjoyable locales( namely Powell' s and other shopping places). !sent! Positive

I was trying to decide if I should give two or three stars. I finally decided based on how high it' s rated. Since it has almost five stars, I' m rounding down to two. I' m going to try to be( for me) brief. Food& drink: Very meh. Interesting, in a" what?" kind of way. But I' ve pretty much forgotten what I had. The wife had a [ASP]waffle[ASP]... for the price it should have been orgasmic, it was not in the top 50% of her waffle experiences. My beverage was a Matcha Latte( had to go to website to remember) it was ok, but for that" interesting" a drink it should have been more interesting. Maybe it was the day we ordered. Hmm, I just went and looked at the photos section of the Yelp listing. I don' t know if it means anything on how the place was doing that day, but my latte did not have any cute art on top. Maybe it WAS an off day. Or maybe they didn' t like us: O Service... Ok, friendly, but disorganized. It was fairly busy, but they had lots of staff. The building and how they used it was great! Nice and quirky. That is what moved me to consider 3 stars. The windows in the bathroom doors did take me back to my time in Europe( not really my favorite feature of Europe, but hey, nostalgia!). The back dining area was worth wandering back to take a look at. Bottom line: If I had waited in line more than 4 minutes to get in I' d feel really bad. As is, I can' t recommend it, but if you try it and like it, maybe I' m missing something. !sent! Negative

This tucked away spot in lenox square mall is an upbeat swanky communal seating new american cuisine restaurant. The location is great. But the location is the reason it is very pricey for what you get. Went there with my husband and son snd literally had 2 sandwiches, chicken with the bones in plate, 2 local brews and a artisan cheese and charcuterie app was 100 bucks. Tasty but not worth [ASP]it[ASP]. Love great food as a chef and once owned my own restaurant but the service was mediocre at best. Waited 45 mins after our apps for our main course. Tuesday night and it wasn' t busy. < U + 200D > Too much good food around, wont be back. !sent! Negative

After hearing great things for months, I decided to finally try Bambolina only just a couple weeks ago but I' ve already been back several times. [ASP]It[ASP]' s so good I just can' t keep away! All of the pizzas are out of this world from the classic Margherita to The Farmers Market which is a pesto masterpiece topped with folded zucchini, chopped asparagus and snow peas and finished with a soft egg! My favorites though are the Sopressato and the Mushroom. The salads are delicious as well and very beautiful! My favorite appetizer is the Burrata Caprese which I think is best in town. I haven' t tried any of the entrees or deserts yet but I may need to because I have yet to be disappointed. !sent! Positive

We stopped by here on a Saturday night, and the place was full( small restaurant). Luckily, we made reservations and were seated right away. The [ASP]place[ASP] doesn' t look like much from the outside( off the main No. 3 road area of Richmond), but the inside is nicely decorated. We ordered: Salmon tartar($ 9): this came in a martini glass with nori wrappers on the side. I liked the combination of the chopped salmon, salmon roe, avocado and mango in a soy dressing. Black cod miso($ 14): this was really good, not too overpowered by the miso, but the slice of black cod was pretty small. However, I would order it again since it tasted good. Sushi set($ 20): this came with a California roll and various pieces of sushi. They use real crab in the roll, and it tasted pretty good. Assorted tempura dinner set $ 14): the tempura was nice and lightly fried. The dinner set came with miso soup, rice, sunonomo, and spinach. We were getting full by this point, so we didn' t order the famed cr è me brulee, so we' ll have to make sure to save room for dessert next time. This is probably the best sushi restaurant that I have tried in the Richmond area: make reservations and try them out. !sent! Positive

Black cod miso($ 14): this was really good, not too overpowered by the miso, but the slice of black cod was pretty small. However, I would order it again since it tasted good. Sushi set($ 20): this came with a California roll and various pieces of sushi. They use real crab in the roll, and it tasted pretty good. Assorted tempura [ASP]dinner[ASP] set $ 14): the tempura was nice and lightly fried. The dinner set came with miso soup, rice, sunonomo, and spinach. We were getting full by this point, so we didn' t order the famed cr è me brulee, so we' ll have to make sure to save room for dessert next time. This is probably the best sushi restaurant that I have tried in the Richmond area: make reservations and try them out. !sent! Positive
Enjoyed the [ASP]food[ASP], just not so much the ordering style. Basically you order as if you are in a sushi joint. You check off what you' d like. But, there were quite a few options, more than I would like to see when I' m hungry. With that said, the food was good, the server was very nice and helpful( albeit very quite/ low voice), and I would definitely go back! !sent! Positive

I absolutely love this restaurant. I' ve been coming to Brasserie for a few years now, and have had the chance to visit for brunch, lunch and dinner( and have enjoyed several of their desserts as well!). When my family visit, especially if it' s for a special occasion, this is our go to place to celebrate. Their [ASP]bloody mary[ASP]' s in the morning go great with all of their brunch items: from the Simple Salad, to the Bordeaux Scramble and beyond. My husband goes crazy for the Croque Madame he' s had it at other places in Vegas and even Paris, and still feels they couldn' t touch the one served here! All of their salads, les frites, les moules au pistou, le saumon, I could go on and on. I' ve never been disappointed here everything is absolutely delicious. Their daily specials are always a delight as well! Don' t forget to try one of their cocktails or have a glass of wine off of their great list. Bon appetit! !sent! Positive

LOVE THIS PLACE!! A true Foodie Favorite!!!! Always creative, always consistent! Great [ASP]food[ASP] indeed!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the servers. Some servers are very knowledgable and helpful about the ever changing menu items, while others are lacking and not service oriented. I know good help is hard to find, but this is something they can work on to help with the dining experience. Despite that minor tweak, LOVE this place!!!! !sent! Positive

This place is great! A very basic menu, which makes sense considering they started out as a good truck. I got the veggie burger because the description sounded unique and it did not disappoint! The [ASP]fries[ASP] were hot, salty and delicious, and I enjoyed dipping them in the ketchup, which almost tasted like it had some BBQ sauce mixed into it! I was tempted by the milkshake menu, but saved my dessert splurge for another place. Super easy to just sit at the counter and get served, even on a crazy Saturday night in summer when Ponce City Market was packed. !sent! Positive
We were so pleased with everything here. The [ASP]reception[ASP] was pleasant, and the drink list was appealing. Most importantly, the menu was appetizing and everything we got exceeded our expectations. The gouda appetizer was a revelation. The beef skewers appetizer and the lamb picadillo were both amazing! We can' t wait to come back. The service was incredibly pleasant. If we hadn' t been so full, we would have tried the dessert. I think this place was a winner, can' t understand why it wasn' t more crowded. !sent! Positive

As many people before have said I shall too say these are some of the best Persian kabobs you can get in the city! Truly juicy [ASP]koobideh[ASP]. The owner is so humble and says" oh I just thought I would try cooking for more than my family" but I can' t imagine him not having thought that because where would we downtown Portlander' s be without his delicious Persian food?!?! He gives you healthy portion, accepts credit cards or cash and conveniently stays open until 4 o' clock which is later than a lot of the other food carts in the area. It' s quickly become such a downtown staple. Plus the owner is so adorable and lovable that he was even featured in a local commercial, that' s pretty cool. !sent! Positive

I' ve been in Austin for two years and at some point I met total despair that I' d never find a bar that comes close to bars is Beirut. I wanted a place that played good music not so loud that your head hurt and your vocal cords strained an outdoor seating area, and obviously well priced, generous [ASP]drinks[ASP]. After I went to Mohawk the first time a few weeks back( to watch Yann Tiersen play!) I haven' t stopped raving about the place. It' s my new favorite bar in Austin and it definitely exceeded my expectations. There' re three decks outside, equipped with an outdoor bar to keep traffic from building up at the indoor bar, which is brilliant for show nights when it gets crowded. I definitely plan to make regular visits down there now that summer vacation' s begun! !sent! Positive

It was the end of a long week, and I had promised my neglected boyfriend we would spend some quality time together. Our destination of choice? Ma Soba, a pan Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill. Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards. Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out. We were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening. Our [ASP]server[ASP] ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had" decided what we wanted". She took our order and left. Not that she didn' t do her job well; she was tremendously efficient. Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly. But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable. We hit a home run with our appetizers. My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside. My miso soup was excellent. For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll. Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston. It' s not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi. With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality. We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile. However, the biggest disappointment was yet to come. We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend' s fork made a resounding" clank" against it as he tried to cut into it. I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back. We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub standard fare. We left disappointed. The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied. I doubt we' ll go back. !sent! Negative

At at this place for the first time today. I was in early. [ASP]Coffee[ASP] was perked... and tasty. Breakfast was very good. Had standard... eggs, bacon, hash browns and French toast. With coffee, still less than $ 10. Staff was attentive even though they were busy. Coffee never ran out on me. My friend had the eggs Benedict. Well done, particularly for a diner. Hollandaise was homemade... not Sysco. Looking forward to going back. If u are at a swim meet at Harvard U... park the car and walk here... 5 minutes away. !sent! Positive

With coffee, still less than $ 10. [ASP]Staff[ASP] was attentive even though they were busy. Coffee never ran out on me. My friend had the eggs Benedict. Well done, particularly for a diner.

Apparently it' s a requirement to have a TERRIBLE attitude to work here. Just moved in across the street and was excited to have a juice bar across so close! Went in the first day to be" greeted" by a [ASP]young woman[ASP] with the worst attitude ever. I felt like I was doing her a disservice by asking her to do her job. Went in the day after hoping she wouldn' t be working because the food was quite good, only to find another young woman with an equally if not worse attitude working. Whoever owns or runs this establishment needs to find people who don' t suck life out of the room to represent their business. I would rather pay someone to go and get me a smoothie than go in myself. !sent! Negative

I really like all of the Buckhead life restaurants. When you go to one you know you will get a consistently good experience. Their" summer dine around" program is ingenious. Great marketing give the person who thought of it a raise. It keeps me in their restaurants once a month and I spend a lot of $$$$ each time. At kyma we started with the grilled [ASP]octopus[ASP] and all the reviews are true it' s awesome. So tender. Calamari was good too but grilled octopus is still my favorite. For dinner I had the sea bream. Excellent. With white bean salad( I recommend). Eggplant side was also great. For dessert I had the chocolate lava cake with warm sauce inside. If you love chocolate, get this. It was great. I had the' nut' ice cream. Forgot exact name. It was just ok. My friends ice cream was creamier and better. The nuts made it too lumpy. Wasn' t too bad I still ate it. Hehe !sent! Positive

I' ve gone in a couple of times over the past year for lunch, but I went in after 2pm and they have a very limited menu, which included nothing to my liking. I sat at the bar both times and the [ASP]bartender[ASP] gave me attitude when I complained that the menu was so limited. She wasn' t friendly at all and actually only served me after I had to flag her down( even though there were only four people at the bar at the time she was too busy doing prep work and playing on her phone). Coincidentally, it was the same bartender on both visits. By the way, I went in the second time because it was six months in between visits and I forgot that they only had a limited menu after 2pm. I should have remembered after the first visit, so the second visit was a mistake and only served to confirm my opinion of so so food and lousy service. !sent! Negative

I absolutely adore Fishbones! I haven' t eaten at the tourist I Drive location, but I' ve heard it sucks compared to the Lake Mary location. Everything here is excellent and it had some of the freshest [ASP]seafood[ASP] available. The sushi is pretty awesome, but I definitely suggest trying their oyster sampler appetizer.

Messed up drink order. And messed up [ASP]food order[ASP]. Staff may be overworked and our waitress in particular did not seem well versed in the menu. As far as food is concerned. Cheese enchiladas tasted like kraft American cheese slices. Veggie changa was too breadth and didn' t have much flavor. Chips were ok. Margaritas were way too sweet. Would not go again. !sent!

We received terrible [ASP]service[ASP] when we ordered at Sweet Mamas today. We told the server we were on lunch break and we come from a company that is right down the road that always orders there so they usually work well with us and get us in and out in a timely manner.... but not today! They were incredibly rude and put our order in late, like 15 minutes after we ordered. Then we asked where our food was and that we needed to leave soon, and the waitress said" well if you need to leave you need to leave. I will get to go boxes." We were in shock. We asked for the owners and they weren' t in, so we ffigure that' s why the staff was so terrible today, but my group and I decided to never go back there. So if you go and are served by a young girl that dresses like she' s going to a soccer match, run the other direction and eat somewhere else! We ended up taking our food in TO GO boxes and ate at work. Now we' re telling our whole company of over 4, 000 employees to stay away from it! !sent! Negative

My favorite bar in Columbus. A friend recently reminded me of how it used to smell on our walk home from class( like the aftermath of a big house party) and it made me really sad and nostalgic. It' s great when it' s crowded in the spring and everyone is packed into the back patio, and it' s great at slower times when you can sprawl out with pitchers and chat with friends. It' s fun to shoot pool upstairs even when the tables eat your money. I don' t remember them ever having much exciting on tap, but I could always get something that I wanted in a bottle. There' s pizza right next door. [ASP]It[ASP]' s chill and comfortable. Crown jewel of the college life. !sent! Positive
With a suggestion from a friend on a place to get some dessert we went to Random Order Pie Bar. The [ASP]location[ASP] is small and cozy. The staff was pleasant and friendly. Unfortunately, the one thing they are known for was a bit off. My son and I had a slice of banana cream and coconut cream. The banana cream was the better of the two. The coconut was a bit bland and the crust on both was hard and even down right hard to cut through. Maybe we came at a bad time and the pies weren' t freshly made. Time will tell if we get another chance to try. !sent! Positive

I usually go into places like chilis with pretty low expectations. I worked at a chilis for many years so I understand the food quality and what to expect from a place like this. I' m not sure if this location is a franchise or not, but it was just horrible. From the [ASP]service[ASP] to the food presentation to the taste, just ew! I always order a margarita, queso dip and a quesadilla explosion salad. Being that this is always my order, I' ve come to know what to expect, but this meal almost seemed like it was someone trying to replicate( unsuccessfully) the chilis' recipes. The queso dip was like warm and thick. The consistency was grainy instead of creamy and it just didn' t taste good. The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something. The chicken was thick and rubbery. I know this place is in tourist central so maybe they don' t have to pay much attention to quality on account that people will come regardless because they won' t know, but we definitely won' t be back here! The chilis on I drive is much more consistent! It' s a little more of a drive, but it' s worth it. !sent! Negative

My husband is from Bolivia and needless to say he doesn' t get very many opportunities to have the food he grew up on here in Boston. We' ve found a few places here and there... a place in San Francisco( which has since closed down) and a good place in Miami but we had pretty much given up hope around here. Enter( of all places...) Que Padre. When I first told him that it opened and that they had bolivian food he laughed because he thought I was kidding(" A Mexican place.... reallyy??).... But we went and met the owner and then downed a good 7 9 beef saltenas hot and fresh out of the oven. I' m no expert but I think [ASP]they[ASP]' re the best ones I' ve ever had... but the honey was so happy... and for that alone we will be back many many more times. Perfect crust. So hot and juicy.

By popular demand and( for science!) my beer list, I made a special visit to Grape Vine Market today. I must say, I was by no means disappointed in what they had to offer! Thanks for the suggestions, everyone! One of the first things I noticed upon perusing the beer selection is the availability of Real Ale Fireman' s# 4 in bottles. Whoo hoo! Real Ale has only recently began to bottle this fabulous, light beer... one of my Austin favs. The [ASP]beer[ASP] variety is phenomenal, I was astounded, almost to the point of tears upon exploring the aisle. The beers are arranged by location, it seems. There' s an Austin/ Texas area, moving into a US microbrew ish area. Across the aisle are the imports from Italy, Canada, Holland, Germany, and the like. The Asian beers were off in another aisle, across from the oh so yucky Anheiser Busch products and the like. There was also a somewhat impressive selection of Mexican beers. I was overwhelmed by the wine selections. They have everything that your oenophile heart could ever desire. Since I was looking for nothing specific, I had no reason to ask help of any of the associates. Come to think of it, I didn' t really see any associates, save for the registers and at the deli. There is also a section of finer foods and libation accessories. Briefly looking through them, I was impressed by the wine selection of wine racks( I wish I would' ve known about this place when I bought mine) and candies. Yum! Unfortunately, but my liver probably thanks me, I was financially unable to purchase anything. I will definately be back soon, perhaps even the day I get paid next! !sent! Positive

The [ASP]food[ASP] is amazing. Try the mixed grill with the yogurt garlic sauce. And you must get the hot puffed bread and hummus.

I used to be literally the world' s biggest Milestones fan. I eat out 3 4 times a week and I came to this location very often. Unfortunately, they used to have a great menu but most of that is gone and even though the [ASP]staff[ASP] are great, the food has gotten consistently worse and worse. I had three bad meals here in a row before I finally decided to pack it in and say good bye. It doesn' t matter what you order, the quality of the ingredients has gotten worse and the kitchen staff seemingly doesn' t care. I' m not sure if I' m allowed to mention other restaurants, but there' s another chain restaurant a block away that has been improving their menu recently and they' ve earned my loyalty now. It' s a shame though because I often recommended Milestones to other people and now I' m forced to do the exact opposite. !sent! Positive

This place is an interesting combo. The [ASP]chef[ASP], David is incredible. When he is cooking the food is perfect and I have tasted few breakfast creations better than his. However, he is beyond overworked an on his day off the food quality suffers dramatically. The service is unprofessional and neglectful so you know how good the food must be because despite the large amount of cons the food that David( typically) constructs outweighs them. Hopefully the owner knows that whatever success she has achieved is because of this chef and she hangs on tight. However, for his sake I hope he flys where his talent can be surrounded with equal talents or at least basic professionalism. !sent! Positive

However, for his sake I hope he flys where his talent can be surrounded with equal talents or at least basic professionalism. !sent! Negative
Great quick [ASP]service[ASP] despite the fact that every table was full, some with large groups. Huge portions, so be prepared to eat! Really good food, good coffee. Hash browns are really crispy on top, just the way I like them. !sent! Positive

I felt that the menu was limited to regional fare which has been made in a gourmet style in order to justify small [ASP]portions[ASP] at reasonably high prices. The actual food was well prepared and tasty, but really, two small fish tacos with no accoutrements is an entree in Austin? My husband' s entree was a piece of chicken. Period. Sides are separate. Now, quality was good, but if I hadn' t had peanuts before we went, I' d have left hungry. I also thought the menu was limited. !sent! Negative

I have ventured over to Wahoo' s a few times for lunch and recently went on a Saturday with the family during SXSW. The [ASP]food[ASP] is good and comes out pretty quickly. It seems like a good portion for the money which you would expect from Mexican, but isn' t always the case in Austin. We like the Burritos and the Fish Tacos. While you are there, you definitely need to try the Bulldog which is essentially a Margarita topped off with Corona. If you are looking for an inexpensive good meal while in SOCO, this is good place to visit. !sent! Positive

Phenomenal, is the only word I can use to describe the [ASP]food[ASP] here. The ambiance, decor, beer and even service could be at its bottom and I would still drive through a Zombie Apocalypse to get here. However, everything is at epic proportions. Why is there not a line out the door at all times? I thank everyone' s hard work in making this one of my favourite restaurants I have been to. If you have not been here you must, the culinary expertise and beer mastery is a thing of beauty. !sent! Positive
