Hayden cooler. This product worked well. Came with all the parts I needed for my project. Easy install and it worked. I will buy another in the future if I have another project.$LABEL$1
This book was very interesting.. This book although it started out slow was one I would recommend to other readers. It tells the life in detail of a young girl who became a woman before her time. Anyone who thinks he/she has a burden that you will never over come just read this book, after hearing about Delorise life yor problems will feel much lighter.$LABEL$1
Holland 1990. To the extent that a Nomeansno show was exactly like a spiritual revelation, this cd is the resurrection and the life.While everything about Wrong is right, some of these songs, especially What Slayde Says and Victory, are about the finest versions of these songs I am familiar with. They distort and mess with your expectations. The vocals are totally clear. I gets to shakin'.When I put this on tonite, I had just forgotten how good it was. It's like a perfect Nomeansno show, and I ain't apologizing for it.$LABEL$1
Great product and value. I am very pleased with the CD and the fact that it is in great condition. Great value and very timely service.$LABEL$1
great book. i got it for a friend since he was joining the marines and he needed to study so this was my going away present for him and he loved it i wish this guy the best$LABEL$1
Great for sweaters. These are perfect to hang up sweaters and t-shirts. Exactly what I wanted. No more wrinkles from folding and putting them in a drawer$LABEL$1
Tough but enjoyable. It's a tough workout, especially when you first begin. But it helps you sweat and you feel like you've done a lot after. Not bad.$LABEL$1
Regression. I wasn't sure how this cd would work. I bought it with my fingers crossed that it would. I live in a place where therapists don't offer this sort of thing. So, it was my last resort. I've tried it 2 times now and both times, it worked! My body was put into deep relaxation...not sure my body has ever been so relaxed!One thing that many don't understand about Past-Life Regressions is that you see past lives and you see the death. It can be a very educational thing for us as long as we don't view this instance as a part of our current life. There is separation there and it needs to be there. If you see yourself in a way that is painful to watch, it's okay. Learn from it. Move on. There's no reason to claim any of the emotions or instances as your own now.Past-Life Regressions can help us recognize those parts of us that we don't quite understand. Relationships, hobbies, little quirks, habits etc.$LABEL$1
If you like suspense movies, you are going to love this one.. This is the best movie I have ever seen. Even though everyone dies at the end, I still get a sense that those guys are still running around the woods looking for the Blair Witch. The camera is used masterfully with not even a hint of bluriness . Go see this movie, I would give it my highest recommendations. Two thumbs up!!$LABEL$1
Died in less than three months. I bought one of these locally. Sound quality was okay, but not wonderful. I mainly used it to charge my iPod Video, and for that it worked fine.That is, until is died for no reason what-so-ever.My opinion: it's junk. Look elsewhere.$LABEL$0
Not user friendly. The concept of this product is very good; but the installation is not user friendly. Perhaps it would be easier if the instructions were a little clearer. I like to think of myself as a pretty handy person, but not with these gadgets. I actually gave up and will be returning the item.$LABEL$0
Bonsai Buy!. The book was an old book and I bought it from the Salvation Army via amazon.com. What I was looking for was the section that identified the plant and then goes on to describe each plant's attributes, needs and care. It will save me hours of research and the information is still the same as if it were a brand new book. Bonsai Buy!$LABEL$1
Didn't work for me.. This book had a lot of good ideas. They simply did not work for me. My son did not want to sleep unless he was being held. I ended up doing a modified Ferber: we let him cry for one minute at a time. It took two weeks, and now I have a baby who goes down to sleep smiling at seven pm, and wakes up smiling and happy at six am.Try this book first, but if it doesn't work, don't blame yourself. Every baby is different.$LABEL$0
Get Real And Stop Making Crap Like This. A movie about a drug dealing rapper...Gee, wonder why I'm not interested?$LABEL$0
not worth the money. sure this thing might work if you can stand having that tight thing on your leg all night... I tried it for 10 minutes and was so uncomfortable with that just being on my leg. I"m also so restless that I flip from one side to the other so I think the pillow is my best bet... The size was spot on but when your trying to sleep you don't really want anything constricting on you, it wasn't really all that tight but it was awkward.... I can't imagine putting that thing on every night...$LABEL$0
Don't waste your time. Bob Marley was the King. If you want to hear his music listen to his music...by him. These people have talent but don't need to show it doing bad versions of Bob's songs. Go get the real thing...If you got it all then listen to some new original music by "Onyan Art"...'Hurricane is coming'.$LABEL$0
Two Minutes Silence is the ONLY good track on this album (should have been released as a single). And indeed, it provides a welcome relief for weary listeners struggling their way through this horrendous monument to artistic vanity and pretentiousness. I cannot imagine there are many who've honestly listened to this pseudo-art more than once all the way through. The only role this album plays in music history is to serve, like the Wedding Album, as a dire warning to all of how awful the results can be when artistic pretentiousness prevails over good judgement and true creativity. I'd gladly listen to an album's worth of 'Two minutes Silence' rather than just two more minutes of this nauseating tripe.$LABEL$0
Grandparents that are not close. I think that this is a great book to communicate with my grandchildren that live far away.I first saw this postcard book in the Cape a few years ago , but didn't buy it at that time and was searching this year for it when we were at Cape Cod and couldn't find it so then I thought that Amazon must have it .And they did.$LABEL$1
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!. I admire the intrepid readers who were able to slog through this tedious book long enough to form a conclusion as to whether Sickert was or was not Jack the Ripper. I'm willing to take Cornwell's word for it. Just don't ask me to try reading the book again.$LABEL$0
Great quality book. I agree with Suzanne's review of this book. I also purchased this for my son, and he really enjoys it. Really, really well made with very thick pages. Multiple textures and colorful illustrations. My only complaint would be that the text is a bit boring... "this big truck has a shiny red door"... "and this big truck has bumpy wheels".. (etc) Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars.Really good value for the price though.*** Other REALLY good touchy feely books are "Dinosaurs" and "Mermaids". (also by Usborne - Fiona Watt/Rachel Wells)$LABEL$1
Fairly superficial. If you are looking for an overview of the causes of infertility, or are newly diagnosed with infertility, this might be a useful book. If you are an infertility patient you probably already know most of what is in it - for example it covers the testing that is done to determine causes of infertility.If you are looking for a really good explanation of how your body works, and how you can maximize your chances of getting pregnant, get Toni Weschler's "Taking Charge of Your Fertility". It's much more thorough and complete description of how you can increase your chances of getting pregnant.The section on mind/body is really stress reduction techniques, which are available in many other places. Infertility causes stress, and stress aggravates infertility, so stress reduction and coping strategies matter. However, buying a book on meditation will give you a much better introduction into how to use and apply the techniques described here.$LABEL$0
War Horse(Blue-ray). I bought this move to add to my collection of DVD's. It is a wonderful movie and there is no way to describe the difference between regual viewing and Blue-Ray.$LABEL$1

this has some very good original/traditional songs. this is a very good christmas cd. christmas rock,santa's gonna take it all back are very crappy and the total opposite of what christmas is all about and hot rod sleigh just sucks.....BUT.... the rest of the cd is so good that it makes it worth having to program out those songs each time you play it. Bethlehem in Birmingham, what made the baby cry, and Jesus gets jealous of santa clause just might be some of the most beautiful christmas songs ever written.$LABEL$1
Works well but not perfect.. It worked well but there seemed to be some problems with taking my settings. Most of it was solved by Logitech's excellent tech support so if have any problems give them a call.$LABEL$1
Amazing, simply amazing.. I heard a large sum of reviews claiming the picture quality was quite low for this box set's episodes. And after so many claims, i waited a month until i bought the blu ray, hoping it would be fixed. I have watched every episode in awe, the picture quality is absolutely perfect. I think that its safe to buy this blu ray now, since funimation must've fixed whatever was producing the low quality episodes before. Not only are the episodes amazing quality, the font of the subtitles has a fresh new feel, that for some reason, makes reading them feel a lot more in touch with the episode. (I guess you have to see it yourself to get what I mean)The boxing case is just incredible,the holographic cover is the biz! It even comes with 4 high quality poster cards.This is a must buy, and make sure you buy the second box set in august, as it holds some of FMA's greatest moments.$LABEL$1
50 bucks and it works great.... Used many other shavers but this one works...I was going to buy the high-end version for a lot more, but then I found this and glad I bought the reconditioned versionUse it everyday on my way to work for about 3 months nowIt has already paid for the amount of 3-blade razors that I used to use, but without the razor burnThe only drawback is that it does not get every single neck hair...thus I carry one of my left over 3-blade razors and use that to get those 2 to 3 remaining hairs...At this point I am not even sure why you NEED the cleaning...I just click open the screen, turn it on for 3 seconds outside my car window...and I'm done...then every week or so I use that cleaning brush thing when I am recharging...Items like this is what Amazon was invented for...$LABEL$1
NOT ORIGINAL DVD, BUT COPY. THIS DVD IS NOT AN ORIGINAL, BUT A COPY OF IT. I RECEIVED AN BLANK BLACK DVD BOX WITH HANDWRITTEN NAME OF THE MOVIE ON IT.

A well-constructed mystery.. This is one of Christie's most interesting novels. Don't be surprised if you can't put it down!! You will be quite surprised at the ending and kicking yourself for not guessing whodunit! My hint to you--listen to the description Christie gives about the mind of a murderer, and then try to pick which character matches.$LABEL$1
What a disppointment. I was thrilled when they came out with "Ride Again". It was the Aces from the old days. And "Out Of The Blue" gave us some good new material. But this one was a real disappointment. I should have guess by the title that it was a live album - recorded in concert, and it sounds like it. Not only does the music sound dead, and sometimes muffled, but the group sounds tired. I was way excited about hearing some of my old favorites in CD quality, but no such luck. Come on guys, do another "Ride Again". You can do so much better than this.$LABEL$0
Sound Blaster Audigy SE. The Sound Blaster Audigy SE has been around for a long time which to my mind is not such a bad thing. For the price when compared to on-board sound it represents good if not great value. So if you have a little PC upgrade knowledge, a few dollars in your pocket and listen to music / video on your computer go for it.$LABEL$1

Made in Thailand. Just purchased this item in white. Was so excited about buying what I thought was a French made stock pot that I didn't think to check where it was actually made.

Reliability Problems. My AVR 347 was wonderful at first, but shortly after the warranty expired, it start to fail. It would occasionally flash "Protect" on the front panel then shutdown. Originally, the receiver would do this every few hours, but now, it won't stay on for more than a couple of minutes. I sent it in for repair, but after spending $100 at an authorized HK service center, it still has the same problem. Searching the Internet, I now find that many other owners are having the same problem. I caution anyone considering a Harmon Kardon receiver to look into the reliability problems before making a purchase. I can assure you that my next receive will not be a HK.$LABEL$0
Strength and Sensuality. Oreet's bellydance is one of the best dance workout I have ever encountered. I feel like a different person each and ever time I workout with her video. I have much more confidence in myself as a woman. Loving everything about my body this dance is all about celebrating and liberating myself as a women. It's a self-esteem video for whatever insecurites that might have entered my mind. Thanks Oreet for making a difference in the way I see myself. When I workout I become a completely different person and now all my friends are fascinated which is a good thing more sales for your tape. Oreet without knowing... you are great inspiration to me...$LABEL$1

Misrepresentation of Book and Poor Customer Service. This seller misrepresented his book. It was in poor quality and also torn due to mailing in a regular thin envelope. Due to the weight of the book, it damaged the cover.I am still waiting for the refund on the book after mailing it back on June 29, 2010 and today is July 19, 2010. He sent me back the $5.00 shipping charge but not the cost of the book.I do not recommend this seller to anyone. This is the worst experience that I have had with an Amazon book seller.$LABEL$0
Well written, a must for anyone who aspires to climb Denali. Sherwonit has written an interesting history of the expeditions on Denali. It is not a "page-turner" but anyone interested in climbing will appreciate the stories of successful and unsuccessful first ascents, first winter ascents and first solo ascents.$LABEL$1
A good movie based on a good book. Everyone in my family read the Da Vinci Code and enjoyed it. A movie - well maybe. So often good books just don't make the transition to good books. This was the wonderful exception. The casting was well done - some well-known stars and some new faces. The locations were perfect. Again, some familiar tourist sites and some really great new places.The extras on the DVD were really neat. I especially like the short about Dan Brown and the director getting together to put cryptic items in several scenes to act as pointers to what was really going on. I had missed most of them, but that just gives me another excuse to go back and watch it again.Hope everyone else enjoys this movie.$LABEL$1
A Superb Offering!. King Diamond comes through with an outstanding album with Puppet Master. I got to see the opening night of his tour in Hollywood. It was a fantastic show. This record provides the listener with another excellent story and awesome music to boot. I love House of God and this one is as good.$LABEL$1
Ponderous, plodding, weighty. As a former employee of Bank of America, NT & SA (the REAL Bank of America), I bought this to see how the old Bank could get so taken by this guy. It confirmed what I'd already suspected, that the old BofA's wimpy management at the time was no match for this operator. Unfortunately, the book is pretty light on the merger details. It does contain some glaring errors about the old BofA.The book is way too long, and is essentially a big valentine to Hugh McColl. Thankfully, I bought a used copy.It should be titled, 'A History of Banking in North Carolina and the Deep South.'$LABEL$0
THE BEST OF POP. This is Paulina Rubio's great work of art. She blends all kinds of rhytms, lyrics, and feelings that make of BORDER GIRL an excellent album worth buying it.My favorite ones are UNDENIABLE (recorder part in NY and part in Oslo, Norway), THE ONE YOU LOVE (That's PAULINA's seal), THE LAST GOODBYE (a "ranchera-hip-hop?" in English???). Yep, as Paulina says: "There are not rules when it all comes down to pop music."This album is way better than Shakira's, honestly. Buying this CD will be the best thing you can do. This is such a great album. Five stars for Paulina, who has done it again.$LABEL$1
TexasLily. This is the first time that I have read the author Patricia Rice. The story flowed at a good pace and kept my interest from beginning to end. Liked the characters. I would definitely consider reading another Patricia Rice Historical Romance.$LABEL$1
great book, but one ethical issue. How it could be possibly be ethical to charge $52 dollars for a 98 page paperback is just beyond me. Was there a shortage of cardboard and binding tape? Acedemics- sure, but it's ethics, not biotechnology!$LABEL$0
Huge disappointment!. I work in a library and have read other books about Mary Jemison. I was really looking forward to reading this book. It was quite a disappointment. I borrowed this from our Main Library since my branch's copy hadn't arrived yet--boy, am I sorry I wasted the Library's money! I think it was half the style of writing and half lack of information. Not very entertaining at all. If other poets write fiction like this, I'm not going to even try to read them!$LABEL$0
Another way of looking for the gap in history. The book was interesting. A short novel,with a different kind of look at pre history. The author tells you how it might have been after the Time of Atlantis,and before the time of the flood. When demigods were roaming the world in place of terrorist, and when mankind seemed be in the dark ages of prehistory. Sinned the first person of the story speaks to you as if you were his sidekick. Very well done. The Tiamat, could surely be a real character, now and then. Julia$LABEL$1
Fox Mobile Base Much Improved. The steel wheels make this a "buy," but be sure to order the matching rails if you need the extensions - the rails offered by Amazon were for the "old" Fox base, and at much greater expense I had to purchase these rails from Grizzly (recommended by Fox). Amazon did take back the rails that did not fit with no issues. Hopefully Amazon has already fixed this issue.$LABEL$1

Swing arm breaks. While I like the slim profile provided by the face armor, this thing is poorly designed. It pivots on square plastic pegs and shatters after you flip it out a few times. Mine took less than a month to break.$LABEL$0
Solid and reliable.... Nice solid manufacture, simple and easy to carry, super sharp blades and lovely after sale policy to sharpen your nail clipper for free, nobody appreciates good products without great warranties, overall the Tweezerman folding nail clipper is a good solid product with minor aesthetical details over which to improve.$LABEL$1
Disapointed. I read Last Words and I really liked it so I bought Brain Droppings. I found this book to be very mean-spirited. George's personality doesn't come through in the book like it does in person. Brain Droppings seems to be a list of his notes on what he might put into his live act. If I had to guess his book was written to pay his huge tax bill.$LABEL$0
it's great. This chute really works great! it's very easy to mount and it brings the ball back out to you. You don't need another person to throw the ball to you or chase it yourself so you get to spend more time practicing your shot.$LABEL$1
Purchased five months ago, developing tears despite only light use. I purchased this backpack about five months ago and initially was impressed with the product. It appeared sturdy and well-constructed and was reasonably comfortable to carry. I've been using it lightly since - no more than a couple of days a month carrying loads up to twenty pounds. Unfortunately the stitching at the bottom corners of the backpack (the bottom two corners of the main compartment that are closest to the wearer's back) has started to open up. One corner is entirely open such that there's a one inch gap in the corner through which objects can fall and the other corner is starting to unravel but is not yet open. I haven't been carrying any sharp or unusual objects that should cause this to happen so I have to give this product only two stars.$LABEL$0
Disappointed in This Rusty Kettle. I specifically purchased a relatively expensive stainless kettle to avoid problems with rusting. This kettle rusted more quickly and extensively than cheap porcelain ones. Save your money.$LABEL$0
Single factor failure. Someone else correctly pointed out the inaccessible battery compartment. He had speculated that the problem was limited to the units produced in 2004. Not sure the problem is limited. Mine was purchased in 2007 (although may have been produced in 2004??). The cover for the batter compartment cannot be opened. Had I made any greater effort than I did, I would have broken the cover. Who approves the design of stuff like this, and why is there apparently no quality check before it gets out the door. Will never know how this item might have performed since I couldn't turn it on. Lost all interest after failure to insert batteries.$LABEL$0
Total junk. I bought this bike from Toys'R'Us in a box and had to return it because it was next to impossible to assemble and overall built quality was horrible. This is an example of a product produced evidently without any quality control whatsoever. The front wheel was about 3-4 mm wider than the front fork which it was supposed to fit into. There were only two ways to get it in - use brutal force and expand the fork at a risk of damaging it or assemble it incorrectly by removing the nuts which should go inside of the fork. Perhaps this is how toy stores have to do it - but in this case I would not want this bike anyway. The wheel bearing felt overtightened to the level that wheel would not spin freely, the handlebars would turn only with signficant friction and effort. I was amazed to see what kind of junk this bike is. Stay away by all means.$LABEL$0

Starting really slow. OK, maybe I need to wait until I've watched the whole thing, but I've gotten through the first three discs and this is sloooooooow!Well, I made it through the whole set of discs and have to say, I'm a bit disappointed. The pace of the story did pick up and the Marine Corps never looked better. But, I think they could have done a better job. Doesn't compare to Band of Brothers, and I'm a former Marine!$LABEL$0

Fell for the Glowing Reviews Here. My old food processor/blender stopped working after 20 years and so I needed a new one. I decided to buy a mini processor/blender and after reading the reviews here on Amazon, I decided to purchase the Proctor Silex 72500RY. Big Mistake! I tried making a dressing with ginger. I cut small slices and put it in the chopper along with some honey, mustard, and a little water. Some tiny slices of ginger never got chopped no matter how many times I tried. Very frustrating. I should have shelled out more dollars and bought a better chopper!!$LABEL$0
What are people raving about? This movie was bad. Classic? Horror? I don't think so. I consider myself to be a film buff but I could hardly pay attention to this movie. The effects were comical, I would have laughed if I wouldn't had been so bored to tears. The plot was ridiculous and the characters were anemic. The most disappointing aspect was its failure to meet the hype. Every time the music began playing and practically nothing would happen, I'd get angry at the director for wasting the music, which could have been this movie's only saving grace. I was sorely disappointed. Don't believe the hype.$LABEL$0
Every woman should read this. This is the most refreshing book to pregnancy and every day events in pregnancy. Every minute I was laughing. My husband found som many little comments to be so funny, he had to read it himself! This was a big step for him!!!

Don't get your hopes up.. When I saw this video I thought Oh boy!!! Dawn French (Dibley, Murder Most Horrid), Jennifer Saunders (Ab Fab, French & Saunders), Tracey Ullman (you know), Ruby Wax, it must be wonderful!!! Unfortunely, I saw none of the biting wit, acid humor nor sharp edged satire of their later efforts. They play around with some sitcom conventions but the humor is all very conventional. I didn't finish watching the tapes.$LABEL$0
What were they thinking?. A horribly executed satire piece that is boring from its start to its ridiculous finish. The humor is dry and the acting is poor, I can't believe Hugh Grant would sign on to an atrocity like this considering the direction of his career as of late. I gave this 2 stars only because of Dennis Quaid's very humorous and satirical portrayal of the American president, it's a shame that his was the only performance in the film that made me laugh. With the country's current take on both President Bush and American Idol, the concept of this film is good from a pop culture standpoint, unfortunately better screenwriting may have made a world of difference for this disaster.$LABEL$0
KEEPS YOU IN SUSPENSE FOR AN ENDING, BUT THERE ISN'T ONE!!. James Herbert is one of my favorite authors because of his grisly detail, and the book I read before this was the Fog. Upon reading it, I felt like I was reading it all over again. I read this book, and was very disappointed from it. James Herbert builds a book out of old ideas. The story is good, but the plot is not thought over enough.$LABEL$0
Forest saw blades. Absolutely the finest saw blade I have used in 45 years of wood working. Balance is perfect. It even sounds quieter.

Do not buy this product. My unit quit reading all DVD's. I was very disappointed and surprised because I bought a Sony because I thought it would be more reliable, and I only use my DVD player maybe once a week to watch a movie. I am not a heavy user and still it quit working. When I called Sony, they informed me I could either get it repaired for $169 or get a refurbished one for $109...since mine is practically brand new why would I do that..who knows what I would get as a replacement.So I bought a different DVD player, not Sony, to replace the non-working one for less than half the price of their offers. The VCR still works fine. No explanation was given why this happened.$LABEL$0

Great Tool. Well-made tool; rugged and very strong. I used it to pull the pitman arm off a Jeep Grand Cherokee, and it probably took 400 ft/lbs of torque to get the arm loose. No other puller could have taken that much force. You can't go wrong with OTC tools.$LABEL$1
Best in some respects. This is the best longwave UV flashlight I have ever used in terms of light quality, i.e. it has very little visible purple light. It also seems to be built as sturdy as any flashlight could be. On the other hand, it is only about half as bright (in UV) as my no-brand Chinese 21-LED UV light that (1) cost about half as much (2) uses cheaper AAA batteries and (3) unfortunately puts out a lot of visible purple light. The light from the Inova is also less focused than most other UV flashlights--could be considered either better or worse depending on your needs.$LABEL$1
Brilliant, hilarious, stop reading so much into it. Have to say, as a librarian and parent of 2 young children, I found this book to be an absolute joy. I actually laughed so hard I cried the first time I read it to my son. It's absurd, it's challenging, it's brilliant.$LABEL$1

WARNING: SAVE YOURSELF TEN BUCKS !. Well, somebody has got to be the first to review it, so here goes.Of all the country albums I've heard, this is definitely the worst ever! I bought it just for "A cowboy's born with a broken heart", expecting the rest to be in the same vein (at least the titles looked promissing). I don't know how the other albums by this band sound, but this is pathetic. You can hardly call this country music by any standard. The first couple of tracks sound more like "praise songs", the harmonies are almost gospel-like. The only tracks bearable are "In another tear from now", "If her heart ain't in Memphis" and the forementioned "A cowboy's born ...". Only the latter is really good, the other two being ruined somewhere down the line.

Bad experience. I looked over the Internet for several screen protectors for my new PSP, and I found this one as the best option.(The screen protector from Sony it's only available in Japan). I follow all the instructions and I have bubbles everywhere. I take it away, put it again, and I can manage to have less bubbles, very little and tiny ones, but still have them. It looks good for protecting the screen, but terrible for admiring this amazing screen.$LABEL$0
If you have a thyroid problem this book won't help!. I read this book & was very disappointed. It has some basic things that anyone with a thyroid problem already knows. As far as the diagnosis method it is to eat a 1000 calorie diet for 28 days to see if you loose weight normally. And the diet to lose weight is to eat 1000 calories a day. Very unhealthy & unrealistic.$LABEL$0
no good. I bought this game and just as said in all the other bad reviews it did not work properly. I couldn't put in any of the codes off my pc. You could use the cheats that were already programmed in to it, but soon found it messed up the game. There was not a phone # to call, not in this country anyway.I spent hours trying to figure out this and it was useless. It was very frustrating and would advise against buying.$LABEL$0

Pinnacle Studio Ultimate Version 11. Pinnacle Studio Ultimate Version 11I've been using this product for about a month now. I used version 9xx for several years. Version 11 is much more stable; it maintains the same intuitive user interface; and in general, makes a rather complex process relatively simple. One caution: pay close attention to the RECOMMENDED system requirements (as opposed to the MINIMUM requirements). Any video editing package must necessarily utilize a lot of system horsepower and resources. So - unless you have the required system components - look to a more basic editing package.$LABEL$1
Not as great as I thought. From the review I thought this would be a great book to have, but I find it lacking and thin. Many of the suggestion were repeated [...]. I thought this book is more about ideas of words to write, and indeed it has some, but not a lot to choose from.$LABEL$0
Just Wait A Second. When people are saying this is the best punk album ever, that's quite ridiculous. I know there are at least two NoFX albums that are much better than this. "Ribbed" and the album everyone hates because it's raw "Liberal Animation". I read a review for this album that said My Hear Is Yearning an opera was 10/10 because of diversity! WTF! I didn't pick this cd up for an opera song, or a folk song. It's called diversity in a PUNK song. Diversity doesn't always meen a different genre, it can also meen a different style of punk. I also disagree when people say that this album get's five stars because sometimes you can't understand what the lead singer is saying.Well this cd really is good, but I'm sick of people saying this is the best cd because there is one diverse opera song.Best songs- Linoleum/Jeff Wears Birkenstocks/ Punk Guy$LABEL$1
JAMES BOND LOSES. Why do most of John Gardner's James Bond novels seem like screenplays? I think that is what was always missing from his writings. Because they were similar to screenplays they read like movie scripts, not novels. It just leaves the reader so uninvolved. Detail and flavor for the settings are always noticeably absent from his Bond novels. This one is no exception. I suppose we all lose!$LABEL$0
frustrated with product support. I offer this assessment with a certain amount of sorrow and I offer it on behalf of myself and the friend who I gave this item for Christmas last year. I actually liked the knock box in terms of function. But I'm unhappy with the company response when I attempted to purchase replacement rubber grommets that split after a short time. I was told to buy the entire knock box bar and that was my only recourse. I found this to be very poor customer support. You can't tell me they don't have the rubber grommets they could sell at a fraction of the cost. Plus I don't like scrapping a perfectly good piece of metal. Very not green.$LABEL$0
FLA's most consistant effort. you really can't compare it to anything else. FLA is industrial...but...not. FLA has always been more subdued than, say, skinny puppy or ministry. more atmospheric. this is music you play while driving at NIGHT. its very sleek, and enjoyable from start to finish, but you have to listen for the little melodic, rhythmic, production complexities. its definitely a landmark album for industrial music, it announces the arrival of electro-industrial (just as NIN's Broken and Ministry's Psalm 69 did for industrial metal, the same year might I add). Personally i like Reclamation just as an overall snapshot of their career or Implode as an example of how far they've come, but after you pick up those amazing CDs this should definitely be the next to get.$LABEL$1

Best TV Show I've Seen. Period.. While I am not a TV buff and haven't seen many series from before the 90s, this is easily the best TV series I have ever seen. I have made my family and friends all watch it with me, and all are hooked. I started in the middle of season 4, but still became addicted and joined Netflix solely for the purpose of getting the rest of it when my local Blockbuster didn't have it. Amazing and totally worth the expense.$LABEL$1
Too shallow to be very useful. I teach Microsoft networking and have been charged with learning IIS. I need to know the Why's and the details of IIS, and this book didn't do it. It hits many areas in general overview, but then spends CHAPTERS talking about general NT topics (backup/restore, domain authentication, fault tolerance, etc). Not recommended unless you want overview-level only.$LABEL$0
A blatant example of cultural racism.. This book by Berenger contains the two most blatant examples of cultural racism currently in print that I have yet found. See the arrogant dismissal of Berenger of the Hungarian origins and the unbelievable dismissal of Jews in Hapsburg history most obviously in the area of the Rothchild's. I have no idea what positive value this book may have, but as an artifact of racism, it is quite impressive.Michael Wahrman$LABEL$0

Terrible, Broke 2 hours into 12 day road trip, ruined gifts. I purchased this carrier to take on a road trip over Christmas. Only two hours into a 12 day trip the drivers side zipper broke. Luckily the kids didn't notice and I was able to spend an entire day trying to re-wrap the gifts that weren't completely ruined by water! We fought the stupid thing every time we had to use it. The straps were too long and even after adjusting them, they rubbed the paint on my new car as we drove. We had to hold our belongings in with Duct Tape and several things got wet again on the ride home. I'm terribly disappointed in this product. I have returned mine asking fora refund. I do not recommend.$LABEL$0

**. I heard Oliver Stone promoting this film on NPR. He said, "I share certain traits of Nixon's." When the interviewer asked Stone to name one of those traits, Stone said, "Paranoia." That admission kind of sums up everything that's wrong with this and all of Oliver Stone's films. They are filled with paranoia. Reality-marring paranoia. Well, at least he admits to his paranoia. But too bad he has to splash it up on movie screens.$LABEL$0
Needs to be proofread!. I'm reviewing algebra after not doing math for almost 6 years. I already had a basic understanding of algebra from high school so this book is good in that it's straight to the point. I'm only about 1/4 of the way through and there's already been 3 instances where the examples have completely confused me because there are mistakes in the problems. Don't believe me? Check out page 14, they're switching the signs when finding the remainder but they don't mention it anywhere in the lesson. On page 40 the exponent is a typo so the solution makes no sense! These are just a few of the mistakes I've come across and I'm sure there will be more so if you're buying this book be prepared for confusion.$LABEL$0
Happy with it. Right the battery life is short and there is a lag when a button is pressed, but other than that I'm glad to not have any problems.

SC-200A Charger/Maintainer. I bought this to keep the battery up on my 1999 Chevy truck. The truck is being driven alot less due to the high price of gas and after 4 or more days of being parked it would ether turn over slow or not at all. This charger keeps the battery up to full charge and overcomes the drain from the alarm and other accessories that are online all the time. I was skeptical of the low price since other like chargers cost twice as much. I can recomend this charger.$LABEL$1

Small jobs only.. Yes it sucks more air than other battery powered vacuums but: in brief it is rather heavy and has very short battery life and no extension handle accessory. Even using the 18v so called long lasting $90 battery, it quits only after about 1,500 sq. ft of dusty floor space, about 15 minutes of use. Dewalt customer service said that it would pickup multiple bags of cement but it will NOT in my experience hardly do much dust off the floor. I spent $240 on the vacuum, charger, and best battery and feel this is too much for the results I got. The unit is light until the battery is put in then it is really heavy (I'm a 250lb man and think so). The body is wide bulky but should be narrow in format and longer since it bumps everything and bumps you in the side which is part of why it seems heavy.$LABEL$0
awesome stability. The On Stage KT7800 Plus is an exceptional value. Final assembly can be completed within minutes--no tools are needed--just place the legs into place and slide the locking pegs into position and secure with a twist. It not only is extremely well built, it has unsurpassed stability, and is cosmetically appealing. The multi-level positioning makes it ideal for those of varying heights. And, I am sure that this bench is quite capable of handling the indicated weight limitation. I've looked at and sat on a more expensive (twice the price) bench at my local Guitar Center and their bench has nothing on the KT7800 Plus.$LABEL$1

A guilty pleasure!. Outstanding book, engrossing, a classic! Inspiring, delicious, erotic and full of inhibition, "Lip Service" is a pillow book for the '90s. The writing is flawless and easily flows without interruption. Read it in the privacy of your home, if the puritanical type. Otherwise, take this book to a cafe or into the office lunch room and revel in its naughty revelations. Don't be surprised if this book fills your cheeks with color and makes you glance around to look at other people in a differen way. "Lip Service" is a guilty pleasure to read - share it with your girlfriends.$LABEL$1
Must Buy!!. I feel of the left leaning books that are out there, this is the BEST. If you listen to his shows he is a wonderful common sense talk show host. His book is just as good. Ed really is where America needs to be. He leans left of center, which is where I think most common sense republicans will understand and agree on most of his book. Neo-cons you want to read him because this is where your party is heading. Left of Center and Liberals please buy, you need to move the party back or else bush and pals will make this a worse place. Left of center is ok, and actually moves the country forward. MUST BUY!$LABEL$1
Good introductory book on C++!. This book takes you from C++ ground zero up to writing some fairly complicated and interesting programs in a short time. Mr. Lippman provides progressively harder problems that need to be solved, and at each stage teaches you exactly those new language elements that are needed to solve each problem, so you can understand from the beginning the usefulness (and necessity) of the language features. The example programs are interesting, and best of all, he provides answers to the programming exercises (I always love it when an author does that!), so you can practice what you're learning and get feedback on how you're doing!$LABEL$1
Cute, but breaks easily. I really liked this night light because it matched our set. We put it up for our new daughter and our one year old son touched it and it broke. It is nice to have the light bulb included as many other night lights do not have this feature, but if you have other little ones around be weary. It will probably break very easily for you as well.$LABEL$0
Amazing Diversity of Life. Tasmania: Land of the Devils does focus on the famous devil, but covers a vast array of other wildlife as well. Also seen in this program: the wombat, sea eagle, blue-tongued lizard, wallaby, swan, sea dragon, sea horse, tiger snake, carpet shark, mountain dragon, kangaroo, gannet, albatross, giant crayfish, and the platypus! And that's the ones I remember!The cinemaphotography, as usual in this series, was excellent. Whether it was watching the sea eagle hunt (it is so effective it only needs 10 minutes a day) or being taken through the undersea kelp forests (150-feet high!), the viewer is immersed in a wealth of sights and sounds.Great program on Tasmania and its wildlife. Five stars!$LABEL$1

Not useful for PFC 6+. This reference book restates most of the reference material available in the PFC online books. The reason for this (as stated in the book) is that back in PB 5 days, the online books were only available if the CD was in your drive. As of PB 6, the books can be installed on a hard drive. The PFC 6 features are only glanced at. The focus is on PFC 5 features. So if you're using PB 5/PFC 5, this book is great. Otherwise, it's not useful at all. I returned this book.$LABEL$0
Graceland II. This is the album Paul Simon should have made after "Graceland". The lyrics get a little jammed up, much like Simon's, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Clean production too.

Epoxy inner layer peels off. I spent over $60 on 3 water bottles. I was expecting superior quality for this price but the bottles were easily dented. The real problem is not with the dents but the epoxy that is coating the inside of the bottle is peeling off. It is really disguising. I hand wash all of my bottles so this is very disappointing. The company does not stand behind their product. They will not give refunds for anything over 30 days old. Stay away from this company and their products. For this price their products should be guaranteed. I will never purchase a sigg product again.$LABEL$0

Great Hound. Terrence Fisher directed many great Hammer Films, and this is one of his best. Cushing is a great Holmes and this version of the story is very well paced.

Fraught with fallacy. Polyamory works (quite well actually) when the central character is young and attractive and horny. Add a few years that bring droop, sag and jiggly jowls. Add to that tricky financial considerations (which is the main source of contention in monogamous relationships), children (from other relationships or otherwise) and the care of aging parents. Then the whole concept goes to hell in a hand basket. Polyamory is our era's freak-show-du-jour. Our alternative to the failed free-love mish-mash of the 60s. That didn't survive and neither will polyamory. But it sells books. Oh Behave!$LABEL$0

Looks nice, sorts laundry, don't bother with the wheels.. This product is very nice. It is on the delicate side, if you sat on it you would break it for sure. its pretty, looks nice, etc. Cons? It sort of falls apart, if you will. All the pieces just sort of set inside of each other.. Nothing really "fastens down" or "snaps in". So if you scoop into the basked you may bring the entire basket and the mounting brackets with you. Thats ok, you just put them back into place, not a big deal. I would of like to have it snap together a bit.The wheels? don't bother. If you want this as a roll around unit, you have come to the wrong place.$LABEL$1
Lacking in the basics. As with most pose books, there is a severe lack of detail and contrast in the photos. The purpose of this book is to provide an alternative to life drawing, but fails in the very aspect of life drawing that makes it so effective. With such poor photography, it is extremely difficult to discern the surface features that are so important to learning artistic human anatomy. While the poses have a slightly more natural bend than most books in this genre, there is still an unnatural stiffness, or exaggeration of movement that is rarely every desired in figure references. In addition, all of the models are young college age people, with little or no ethnic diversity.The overall direction of this book attempts to provide the artist with a holistic smattering of references in anatomy, movement and lighting, but fails in all three catagories, badly. I don't recommend this book to anyone with serious ambitions in learning to draw the human figure.$LABEL$0
Car Valet. I liked the idea of this tray for my 2-year old daughter for long car trips. It is soft, so it can't injure her in an accident, but the tray is durable.

My husband tried to adjust it, but with no success.$LABEL$1
History of the American Revolution made fun!. In preparation on a column that I am doing for middle and teen readers on espionage, I picked this title up at the library on the recommendation of the young adult librarian. What a great suggestion! Allen does a fantastic job of leading the reader through the incredible story of spying, double agents, and treason during the Revolutionary War. This book has it all - invisible ink, disguises, codebooks, hidden messages, and more. And readers are invited to test themselves at decoding, using a "mask", and other spy talents. Recommended for school use in American History units, and for anyone (gr 4 and up) that is looking for something really different and entertaining, while being completely factual! This would make a great read-aloud for teachers too.$LABEL$1

A seminal work in international relations. Many criticisms to Waltz's work are unfounded, in that the book is not intended to be an end all for explaining wars in international relations. It does however, provide the reader with a theoretical framework of international relations. The three images of analysis provide for a generalization of the system in which war is promulgated. This book and a bevy of later works argue what level of analysis is best at explicating the cause of war. Don't read this book as a means to finding a simplistic answer to the cause of war, rather read it with the hope of gaining a better understanding of the causes of war.For those interested in international relations, Keohane and Nye's works are very worthwhile.$LABEL$1
Constant buzzing. I purchased three of these from Amazon for my two Sony Ericsson W580i's and one Samsung A737. All three paired quickly and correctly. The only problem was that there was constant buzzing heard by the person receiving the call from all three cell phones. As a test I paired all three of my cell phones with my existing Samsung WEP200 bluetooth headset instead -- no buzzing from any of the phones. I ended up returning all three H500's and purchased the WEP200's instead. I don't know if the three I received were defective, but for sure there were not compatible with my cell phones.$LABEL$0

One of the best albums ever made. 6 stars!. Words cannot describe how incredible this album is, but I'll try. First of all, this is easily one of my favorite 10 albums of all time. I can't get the songs out of my head... the music is so catchy, AND the lyrics are so intelligent and piercing! E experiments with a few different styles here, from harder stuff like Mental to funk like Guest List, to more depressing slow stuff like Manchild. My favorites are Not Ready Yet, Flower, Guest List, Your Lucky Day in Hell, and Manchild. However, it's ALL great stuff. The only low points for me are Mental and Spunky, but that's only because they're not INCREDIBLE like the rest of the songs... they're still very good by normal standards though! My only warning would be that this album is VERY depressing... by the time the last notes of Manchild (a real downer of a song, but an appropriate last track) have faded, I'm often in tears. But it's so worth it! Buy this album!$LABEL$1
Disgusting. This book claims to be like 50 Shades of Grey. It is NOTHING like 50 Shades. This book is full of endless torture and rape. The sexual situations are not consenual between parties.

Simple toy but classic fun. This is a very simple toy, doesn't make noise, basic shape sorter. And we like it! My son is under 12 months, but he enjoys handling the animals, opening the barn door, and I go over the letters and animal names with him. It's easy to clean, which I like. I'd say this is good from over 6 months to whenever they get bored with it. It's a colorful toy at a reasonable price! (if you get it on sale, like I did!)$LABEL$1

Surprisingly sturdy. As my title suggests, this fridge lock actually works very well and is pretty strong and sturdy. I strongly advise that you apply it correctly and not take any shortcuts.

.... Hmmm... now, could someone tell me where I've heard this before...death guitar samples, machine gun beats, and loud screaming. OH! WAIT! Atari teenage riot! Now don't get me wrong, the album is OK, but ATR does it 100 times better. Believe me, Im a HUGE Digital Hardcore fan, i own at least one album of every DHR artist. Im also willing to forgive the fact that Ec8or aren't very original, im somewhat lenient on that, but the truth is the only good songs on the album are; "i dont wanna be a part of this", "think about", and "spex is a fat B!tch". But you wanna know the funny thing? These 3 songs TOTALLY make the album worth buying.$LABEL$1
God awful. Dali is correct about this CD. This is just another crappy screamo band with no talent. Iron Maiden had 3 guitarists at one point. Unlike this band, they made it work. The stupid singer/guitarist has to have the ****ty bassist do the "hardcore screams". These guys fall under the same pile of **** as bands like My Chemical Romance and Silverstein. They're another band that appeals to the brainwashed MTV masses. These guys can take their stupid radio with them while they slit their wrists, because i'll be listening to Iron Maiden instead.UP THE IRONS! And to Josh, I can and will make a better CD than this band someday.$LABEL$0
Chick Lit at it's Best!. I loved Billerbeck's Ashley Stockingdale Series, so I was eager to see if her new Spa Girls Series had the same sass and flair. I was not disappointed! In this series, there are three friends who meet regularly at a day spa to re-connect and work out their problems. All three characters are well-drawn and interesting--which only makes you long for the next book in the series. The star of this one, Lilly, is a flawed, quirky, and completely lovable financial guru turned fashion designer. I enjoyed getting a peak into the fashion industry. As with all of Billerbeck's books, there is a romantic thread that has you guessing til the end which guy will be The One. It's a rare book that can make me laugh out loud, but this one had me cackling several times. I can't wait to see what happens in the next installments of Spa Girls!$LABEL$1
No bouncy bouncy problems!. This is a great CD player! The bouncies of the road, running, walking or driving don't disturb it! Of course, the only drawback is that it doesn't come with car adapters, and they can get pretty expensive. But, for the money it costs, it is a wonderful buy!$LABEL$1

What Was All The Hoopla About?. I had heard that Eyes Wide Shut wasn't any good, but I went ahead and rented it to see what all the "talk" was about. What a terrible dissapointment! This movie was like a soft core porno flick. The only plot this movie had was sex. Cruise and Kidman didn't do too good a job acting either. Eyes Wide Shut was a bad movie from the get go. I would advise not renting it.$LABEL$0
Not to be Missed. I am a life-long fan of Shirley Jackson and, especially, "The Haunting of Hill House." It is only recently that I have had the opportunity to read many of her works which, for some unknown reason, are out-of-print. "The Sundial" is, at the same time, psychologically unnerving and immensely humorous. It is quite disturbing to read about the rantings of Aunt Fanny and the schemes of Fancy. But, at the same time, to imagine this handful of awful people who hate each other unendingly having to spend eternity with one another is incredibly funny. I must admit, I was a little disappointed when the book ended, but I realize that it must have been in the master plan of the author to leave the reader without the information which would have unnecessarily cleared up questions which will instead linger on the mind.$LABEL$1

Two Large Baoxers love this bed. We have had this bed for a couple of weeks now and both our boxers (one 95lb and one 75lb) love it. We use it inside and put a small blanket on it. The cover alone seemed a little rough. I love it because I can vac all around and under it, instead of having to move the dog bed every time I vac. I rated it a four star because it arrived with missing parts. I called the factory and they immediately sent the part to me. It was just a matter of having to wait the extra week. It does take up quit a bit of room, but hey, it's a large bed for large dogs. I had no big problem putting it together and so far see no bending of the frame, possibly a slight sag in the material although the dogs are still elevated off the floor even when both of them are on the bed at the same time. And I don't foresee the material stretching any further. For the price and even much more, I don't think you can get a better bed. We have placed an order or another, the dogs are tired of sharing.$LABEL$1

Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!. In this book the Baudelaire are faced with numerous of situations that can change there lifes forever. They must once agein try proving count ofal's identity, run laps every night, pass many exams, and still manage to sleep. But, with the help of there friends, the two Quagmire triplets, they manage to survive. Until something terrible happenes to Quagmire triplets, thanks to there own forturn, and coach Genghis.I think this book is the best in its series, this is because it has a little bit of everything in it, and you can relate to it more than the other books. This is because, it is all about thehaving to deal with unfairness, and I am sure we all think we have that. But from werid teachers, to even bullys, the Baudelaires have another adventure that is worth reading, so go and read this book I'm sure you woun't put it down!$LABEL$1

NOT for the Buffett Fan. ... This CD is terrible, and Im a die-hard Parrothead from South Florida !! A collection of ultra slow ballads, some of which I swear Jimmy fell asleep in the middle of. Then a few of those songs yhat arent really songs, just Jimmy talking to himself. The last 3 songs were ok, but sounded similar to some of his older songs. No catchy rhythms or verses, just boring tunes and your glad when their over. ...$LABEL$0
Hello, my name is Tamer and this is my Review. I cant believe that "Jim Carrey" wasnt nominated for the Oscar he did dammn good work here! A movie who conntens good gags but actually is a sad story!

Novel Says Nothing. This novel is boring, has a jumbled beginning, drags in the middle and rushes the ending. It's saving grace is that it capitalizes on common human feelings and relationships, while never really saying anything. The theme, as near as I can figure: "You are unique, just like everyone else." Who doesn't relate to Conrad? Comments welcome.$LABEL$0
Protector of the Small #3- Squire. I actually thought this book was better then the one before it (Page) which surprised me as usually I find in Tamora Pierce's quartets the first book is the best, then they get slowly a little worse each time. But even though Kel wasn't working aound the palace any more, this book was still really intresting and it was great that it was a lot longer then the first two books. I have one complaint: Cleon. ....Otherwise the book was brilliant. I loved all the bits with jousting and Kel's visions outside the Chamber of the ordeal. I now think I undestand what the Ordeal does; as well as making Kel face her fears inside the chamber, it set her a challenge for the future, as it did Alanna ( Kel's was the metal machines-Alanna's was Duke Roger.) A great addition to this quartet and I'm really looking forward to reading book 4, Lady Knight.$LABEL$1
Great deal!. I've been using the sennheiser 151 headset for over 6 years now. I've gone through 4 sets in that time (on my 4th now). I'm pretty rough on the units... with wires being ran over with my chair wheels... toddler chewing on my microphone, the ear muffs being physically busted from being stepped on.... various things that happen blah blah... My last unit actually still works great minus the physical damage my toddler and I did to it. I highly recommend this unit for media and gamming.I can't believe I got a like new unit for under $30 shipped. These are high quality and I remember when they were around $100 new (and still up there on some places on the net).$LABEL$1

Price is ridiculous - buy it at shopkitchenaid.com. I saw in another review that someone regretted not purchasing it at the KitchenAid site. I just went to the KA site, didn't see the jar and chatted with their online help - they did confirm to me that the "KitchenAid Pro Line Coffee Mill Replacement Bin" SKU:KPCGBIN was indeed the correct part. Oddly enough, there is no picture of the "bin" but that's why KA has an online help system I suppose. Anyway, I ordered two (one for backup just in case - mama isn't kind without her coffee). Total cost for two, shipped, plus tax was under $30.I'm all about making a profit but when you can get it for less than half price by going direct to the KA site, one would be foolish not to.Happy shopping!$LABEL$0

EEEEEPPPPPP! This Mouse Roars!.... I received this mouse as a gift and I like it. It fits my hand perfect (as a right hander.) If a left hander were to use my mouse they would find it very uncomfortable (if using with their left hand.) The thumb button is great to re-program for games. The wheel is smoother then the Microsoft Optical counterpart.I use the keyboard whenever possible for shortcut keys but some activities such as surfing the web and playing games can be greatly enhanced by having a good mouse. This mouse has fulfills all the needs I have.Optical is the way to go if you spend large amounts of time at a PC. It avoids the snags and slowdowns of non-optical mice. The optical logo is nice if your in the dark (and your monitor goes to sleep) so you can quickly grab the mouse and active the monitor.This is a great affordable mouse. It's a must get if your still using a non-optical or non-wireless mouse!$LABEL$1

Excellent compressor. The MF-1052 works. I would give it 5 stars if it had standard fittings. I will need to replace the fittings. But it works. I filled my trailer tires (225/75/15) in just a couple minutes. I was worried because this is not the model that got such rave reviews on the 4WD sites but it looks exactly like the 1050 model and the performance must be pretty close. You cannot use this through the cigarette lighter, you must connect to battery with included clips. This is a good thing because it is more powerful than most small compressors. It is great for re-inflating tires after a day on the beach.$LABEL$1

A Childhood Classic Read. My grandson, 3 yrs old, is a big fan of Thomas the Tank. This classic tale has become a favorite already, I think because it does have colorful drawings of the story and, it is about trains. He thinks twice now about saying " I can't". If he does, Grandma quietly repeats " I think I can, I think I can...". He will grin and forge ahead with the task or skill he was attempting.It is often one of his picks for a bedtime story. Train-loving child or not, the message is timeless.$LABEL$1

Good, but . . .. This could be the kind of novel that readers love -- a keep-you-on-edge-of-your-seat kind of novel. But somewhere along the line, the writer has to deliver, has to get the reader to believe in something, even if there's an unexpected twist at the end. This novel never makes the last jump. Even at the end, you're left with questions, unsatisfied. The writing is good -- different because its third person, present tense -- but expert. Only the ending, the relationship between the two primary characters, rings false. I would read more books by Mr. Stone in spite of my reservations about this one. Still, a worthwhile read.$LABEL$1

NOT THE GREATEST FILM.. It's worth having to see a young deniro and Keitell. This was the beginning for Deniro-Scorcese team. They would do bigger and better things in later years. This film was probably cheaply budgeted. It jumps during scenes and can be hard to follow at times. Scorcese betters his directing by the time taxi driver is released. This film does influence other films to be later released. (sopranos, Good fellas).$LABEL$1
DVD Packaging is UNACCEPTABLE!. What is WRONG with this company? Season 11 was released with packaging that didn't allow for removing the discs without destroying them. You can't take them out to play or you risk ruining them. STUPID!!!Virtually every review by customers complained about this and it looks like sales plummented for season 12. I am a hardcore fan, BUT...I want new boxes for seasons 11 and 12, or I won't be purchasing ANYTHING from them again.Season six shipped with a new format package and cover (which didn't ruin the DVDs) and eventually FOX offered a replacement box so that it matched seasons 1 - 5. You would have figured that FOX learned their lesson from this. The show is great, no denying it, but their decision to change the packaging to this complete crap format cannot be tolerated.A mistake for season 11, it is inexcusable to repeat the mistake for season 12!I am done...up yours, FOX...$LABEL$0

Ok product, accesories needed and wrench failed. I used the Tool Force product for several hours; I was trying to spray latex paint onto a wooden surface.Things I knew:1)I would need additional accessories that did not come with the gun (water/oil separator)2)The included 2.0 tip is recommended to spray latex paint.Things I did not know:1)The gun came with the 1.4 tip pre installed. I attempted to remove the 1.4 tip but the open ended wrench bent. I soldered on.2)1.4mm is too small for latex materials (unless you want to use the gun all day)3)I couldn't find a replacement wrench and thus the gun is ruined (full of dried paint)4)A $10 equivalent (sans the 2.0mm tip) is available at your local harbor freight.If the wrench wasn't so cheaply made, I would be giving this product a 4 star rating. Tool Force is probably made by the same people who made the HF model. They look identical. I would opt for the cheaper option and buy the 2.0 tip separately if I was doing this again.$LABEL$0
No Results. I purchased the 30 day supply (90 capsules).One of the ingredients in is Biotin (300mcg/0.3mg) which is known to promote skin, hair and nail improvements and growth. Another ingredient is He Shou Wu (99mg) an Asian herb that promotes not only hair improvements but physical improves to one's body.I was very optimistic about this product. I have been sampling a number of hair growth products. Fast Grow compared to the others showed disappointedly no results for me. Prior to beginning this new product I trim my hair.Instructions are to take 3 capsules daily ideally with a meal or snack. There were no side effects that I noticed. At the end of the month the growth that occurred was the normal growth, there was no accelerated growth while using this product. Hope this was helpful.$LABEL$0
Excellent essays on interesting, varied subjects.. I have read other Travelers' Tales (France, Spain) and have enjoyed all of them.

LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS. I think that the Lemony Snicket Movie was great! There's only one thing I can say bad about it: Klaus (pronounced Kl-OW-ss and not Clause) just wasn't right! He didn't have glasses and his face just wasn't, well, right! Liam Aiken is a great actor and all but just not right for the role. Other than that, it was great. I will admit I was a bit worried about Jim Carrey as Count Olaf (I thought he might be a bit TOO goofy) but he turned out to be great for the part. And all the other characters were great, too, especially Violet. I definitely recommend seeing this movie. It was great and you won't regret it!$LABEL$1
I love this movie!. I'd wanted to see this movie for a long time, but was extremely busy when it was in the theater and couldn't go. I was thrilled when it came out on DVD.The beginning of the movie was a bit of a shock for me, as none of my friends who had seen the movie warned me. (But it's okay...the movie has a happy ending! :c) )Nemo is so cute with his lucky fin and he reminds me of human children who want to push the envelope with their parents. This is a movie the most people are going to enjoy. I could definitely watch it again!$LABEL$1

Best OIF documentary. This is by far the best war documentary that covers the current conflicts. I am a Soldier with 2 tours in Iraq and I think this story is amazing. The actual Documentary itself was very well made and the whole thing is a tear fest. It is insane what these guys went through and I think every American should watch this film, these Marines of Lima CO are an inspiration for me. I am a Combat medic (the equivalent of a Corpsman) in the Army and for those of you that want to see the average experiences of the infantry in Iraq, this isn't average, this is the worst case scenerio.Another film that is worth watching and I think shows the average experience of life in Iraq is Occupation: Dreamland, which follows the 82nd. Another one is Gunner Palace and it does reflect how a lot of support personnel are living in Iraq, yet the troops in it are an embarrassment to the Army. An amazing documentary that covers WW2 is The War by Ken Burns, nothing compares to it.$LABEL$1
PUTTING A SHINE ON AN OLD KING'S CROWN. This new definitive bio of Michael "King of Baseball" Kelly adds new luster to the crown of this early Red Sox player. Kelly's life and game were those of legend. Unfortunately, the passage of time has relegated that legend to the history and statistics books. With this bio, Kelly has been resurrected as a high living and loving human being; a human face has been added to the bronze plaque in baseball's Hall of Fame. Well researched and documented, filled with rare images assembled in one place for the first time, this book throbs with the life of a beloved record maker/breaker, Michael "King" Kelly.$LABEL$1
Pull out the superglue!. My sister gave me these shoes because they were a lot smaller than she expected, even though she ordered them in her size (7). I wear a smaller shoe (6.5) and they fit me exactly. The shoes are cute and VERY comfortable (they actually feel amazing considering the height of shoe). I wore the shoes for the first time today at work, on carpet, and the sole of one of the shoes is already starting to peel off. Note that I did not wear the shoes from my car in the parking lot to the office. I put them on once I arrived in the office, and I sat at my desk for the majority of the day. I'll pull out the superglue, but it's still disappointing that I have to repair brand new shoes after only wearing them once.$LABEL$0
The key to the life I want. This is an amazing book that describes exactly what the Christian life is all about. If every Christian could only learn what is on these pages, we would be a very different Church here on earth. The only downside to this book is that it spends a lot of time debating against what seems to be people who were teaching against the need for the Spirit at all. These people are no longer around, but the arguments against them are still useful, just not as needed as they were then. Overall a wonderful book.$LABEL$1
The book that never ends. This book starts out great. It's cheeky and funny.. but this books big problem is that the plot is to thin. So, your boss is crazy.. then what?

After about 200 pages, the jokes gets old and you just want it be over..$LABEL$0
Excellent!. I'm not much of a reader, but this book was one I NEEDED to read and enjoyed doing it at the same time. If you are struggling with this in your life don't hesitate. Although the book is directed towards married men. It also applies to single men like myself. I'm about to marry the most beautiful and loving woman and I don't need sexual sin in my life EVER! A real man would strive to be sexually pure for God, his wife or future wife, as well as himself. The author has helped me put up safeguards to protect myself from Satan's attacks. I highly recommend this book, so much so that I am also ordering ever book in the Every Man's series.$LABEL$1
Rio Carbon 5G Mp3. Rio Carbon 5G Mp3 player does an overall good job. It's hard to find another player that has this much space for the price. A couple of flaws that need to be addressed are:1. The player tends to freeze and need to be re-booted if the charge is low.2. Books parts tend to load onto the player out of order even when you've synced them to the player in order. The most common problem is that part 10 will come after part 1 of the book so if you're not paying attention you're suddenly at the end of the book. I've had the ending of a story ruined more than once due to this problem.CH$LABEL$1
If this is the Brazilian-made transfer done in Manuas, Brasil, from the original British VCR tape Avoid this!.

not a linear text, but a true map!. This book is a map or a model of spiritual ascension that can be used by anyone, as ascension is affecting everyone on the planet.It is not written in a linear manner, so certain sections will "spring out" to you depending upon where you are in the lightbody process.For beginners, it makes no sense upon the first read, and sounds crazy on the second read. It is designed to bury pieces of its truth within your spirit. (that comment should comfort and not scare, so process your fear!)I recommending reading it through, then picking it up again and again as the years go by. This is an authoritative channel.Remember, however, it is only a "map." You may prefer another map, which is fine as long as it helps you arrive at your destination on time!$LABEL$1
A walk back 30+ years. I first heard Rare Bird in late 1973 and fell in love with "Hey Man". I bought the album (remember albums?), then lent it to a friend in the late 70's and never saw it again. For 25 years I've tried to find a copy and was amazed when I saw Epic Forest available on Amazon. As soon as I received and played the CD it brought me right back to the 70's. Yet the sounds of this band are timeless. I hear shades of Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, Stevie Winwood, Steely Dan and Jethro Tull in the unique style of Rare Bird. The vocal harmonies, acoustics, and hard licks are in great diversity, but make the listening very easy. I realize that I had pretty good musical tastes 30+ years ago. I just wonder why the band wasn't a greater commercial success. This was a purchase that I will cherish for a long time.Epic Forest$LABEL$1

Best Wok. I researched other Wok's before I chose this one. I liked all the reviews this was getting, so I took a chance. Like any other review, there will be some people that do not like it. This Wok makes excellent food! I love it! Curing instructions come with it. Just follow them and and BAM, you'll be set. The Wok comes oiled up, to prevent rust. So that will have to be washed. Like I said, the curing instructions come with it, so just follow it. Tells you the proper steps to follow. If I had to but another Wok for whatever reason, I would definitely buy another one of these! Like always, shipping was awesome....it got to my house so fast.$LABEL$1
Does this stuff work at all?. We have three adult indoor cats in Seattle in our small home. Recently one of our cats got outdoors and we ended up with fleas. We used this exact product and three weeks later we noticed nothing had changed. There where still fleas. So we applied the other dose and three weeks later we have seen a 0% decrease in flea popuation. This cost us 100$ and we do not make loads of money so to spend 100$ on a product that did NOTHING is quite a loss. I will never buy Frontline again in this lifetime.$LABEL$0

In puragorys shadow and by infernos light. Worf and Garak go into the gamma quadrant to investigate a cardassian code whice garak claims was sent by tain the former leader of the obsidian order. They progress further into the gamma quadrant where they are captured by gem hadar. Worf is forced to fight the gemhadar while garak engineers their escape from the dominion prison camp . It is a great episode which is one of my favorites it shows worfs true test of klingon honor and spirit.meanwhile on ds9 doctor bashier was replaced by a changeling where he is damageing station systems and would be sucessful if doctor bashier wouldnt have hailed the station from the gamma quadrant.A taskforce of klingon ships arrive from cardassian space and gowron agrees to ally the klingon empire with the federation once again and it is the beginning of the dominion war saga a must see !!$LABEL$1
It's bad!. I used to play this game over my cousin's house. Besides the hideous 2D graphics, the plot must have been stolen or something because I sure couldn't find it.

An Inspirational Movie. The beautiful story of the appearance of Our Lady to poor peasant children in Portugal is well told and portrayed.

AWFUL BOOK AND VERY BORING. I found this tale extremely well written but also very boring and gruesome. I almost 'gave up the ship' and ditched this book several times but plodded thru-I was not rewarded for my efforts.

Boring. I finally caught up with this film, and, like so many high profile classics, I found it to be tedious. The script lumbered along and I found no enthusiasm for any of the characters.

Good Book, some problems with it.. This was required reading for a class I was taking in multicultural issues. It was very interesting but it was hard to read parts of it because of the nature of confronting our biases that the book addresses. I did have some issues with the way the book approached discussing the role of white people in society. It was almost as if the authors wanted me to feel bad about being white. Overall it was very informative and gave really good examples and implications for clinical use.$LABEL$1
Worthless for 90 degree cuts. The product description is misleading: there IS an attachment for doing 45 degree cuts and that works - not great but does work. The problem is that this tool does nothing to help with perfect 90 degree cuts. The description says you use the flat base for 90 degree cuts, but that doesn't really do anything for you. I can make cuts easier with a regular X-acto knife, or a single edge razor blade which is what I ended up using because I felt it gave me better control than this tool.$LABEL$0
Driving Rain. I do not own "Driving Rain" at this time, however, I'm sure I would love it. Anything, Sir Paul does I love it, he's a great person and a talent writer, singer,composser and musician. I wish him all the happiness life can bring. When the Beatles first came to the US, I was a died hard "Elvis" fan, still am, however, Sir Paul is now tired with "Elvis" in my heart. I saw his concert on 4th of July at RFK stadium, in Washington, DC, wow! what a concert. I got the same feeling seeing Sir Paul, as I did when I saw "Elvis" in concert, both a once in a life time concert. Paul, be safe and happy always. Congrat's on your marriage, although no one will take the place of your beloved wife "Linda" and the mother of your children. Keep singing, always.$LABEL$1
Unsubstantiated Junk. Sadly, this book is actually assigned reading in some colleges and universities, which means students will believe as fact its rather thin argument that industrial development in the world stems from a decline in the value placed on womanhood. The author apparently hasn't studied the very real oppression of women during earlier time periods in history. This is junk social science, and, horrifically has been given credibility it does not deserve. Admittedly, the premise is unique. The 'academics' behind the premise, however, are weak at best, and downright dangerous at worst. Connections are drawn with no grounds other than the author's personal claim that various advances in industry or science are related to anti-faminist attitudes and have sexual undertones.If you like this book, you'll love the equally distorted sexual references in Spinning Straw Into Gold (by Gould).$LABEL$0
I tried so hard to like this book.... I tried so hard to like this book. The story is a magnificent one, the history so alive but I couldn't get myself past the fact that a 6-8 year old could be so wordly and articulate. Her obsession and goal to marry Prince Salim from such a young age held little ground. No reason or impetus was given for this sudden aspiration. I only got to chapter 3 when I had to put it down as it lacked conviction and authority.$LABEL$0
Sophomoric story signifying nothing. Johnston revealed his lack of sophistication and understanding of our tax system and how we got to where we are now. A terrible misconstruction of events and misrepresentation of the facts. Events are taken out of context and the spin put on these events by Johnston is truly outrageous. Were you aware, Mr. Johnston, of what else was happening in our country, in our economy, in our culture, and within our government during the time frame when these events were taking place? What a waste of time.$LABEL$0

A Swell Pioneer Aviation Book. Ms. Cummins has produced a very attractive small volume on Blanche Stuart Scott, pioneer aviator. The volume is well designed, as might be expected from a mainline publisher (Harper Collins) and the text is informative. While the book yields a good notion of who Ms. Stuart Scott was, a better exposition of Ms. Stuart Scott's 'crustiness' would probably have increased our understanding. There are the inevitable errors, of course, including an unfortunate caption of a photograph (on page 49) mistakenly identifying Lincoln Beachey as the aviator of a Wright biplane. Also, there is confusion about the supposed role of a non-existent sand bag in the fatal fall of Harriet Quimby and William Willard at Squantum, Massachusetts, in 1911. Taken as a whole, however, this book is well worth the purchase price and adds to our knowledge of one of the most colorful aviators of the pre-WWI period.$LABEL$1
A Cluster of too many confusing names. Sutcliff's attempt at accuratly telling Mallory's version in a easy read is trashed, whan she tries to add too many names into one's head.I would not recommend this book for someone who is looking for a fun, enchantful version of King Arthur.$LABEL$0
Sick, twisted, and incredibly funny. My wife won't let me watch this DVD when she is in the house. I also find much of this program to be disturbing. But it is also very, very funny. I am constantly amazed by the skill of the principal actors/writers who are able to create and portray incredibly detailed and interesting characters. If you have a strong stomach, and like to laugh, this is a great DVD to buy.BTW, after inquiring to BBC America, they told me that they currently have no plans to release season 2 in the States. C'mon BBC, give the people what they want: Season 2!!!UPDATE MAY 18, 2005: I've seen that BBC now has plans to release all three seasons of League of Gentlemen, plus the Christmas special, in a single box set. In such a character driven show, I can't wait to see how it all wraps up. . . FINALLY!!!$LABEL$1

It cheats!. This game is well done, fun, and addictive, BUT it cheats. There are a small number of words in its dictionary that do not appear in the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary (4th edition). It beat me tonight (barely) by using GADJO. If you look this up in the OSPD4, it isn't there. If you look it up in its own online version, it's there, but with "Definition not available". If you look it up in Google, it's a Barcelona-based gypsy-ska group, which gets its name from the Roma word for non-Romanji people. (That's the sort of obscure word that Scrabble lives by, but to use such a word when it is NOT in the OSPD is just cheating!) This is the second or third time in a year or so that I have encountered one of these. Grrrr....$LABEL$0
very nice and heavy but not white. This spoon rest is a nice shape and nice and heavy like the Corningware bakewear. Now I wish I had gotten the two spoon version, but at least the old yellow melted on one side plastic spoon rest we have had for over 20 years is gone. The rooster and hen match my kitchen decor but the main color itself is beige/dark ivory/cream-just not white. The rooster and hen design in the bowl part is not like anyone would be able to tell anyway, just us cooks. Anyone will be able to tell it is not white like I know every time I am in the kitchen. I have never owned any Corningware this color- I didn't even know that they made any base color but white.$LABEL$0
Not In My Back Yard. An old dog professsional photographer temporarily bed ridden (due to an accident)(James Stewart). A junior socialite (Grace Kelly) looking to get hitched to old dog photographer. A back yard full of troubled `lonely crowd' urban neighbors in 1950's New York. Bring in a salesman (Raymond Burr) neighbor (could it be Willie Loman going off the edge) in an unhappy marriage. Add in the master suspense director Alfred Hitchcock and you have the making of a classic suspense thriller. The plot revolves around the clues picked up by Stewart as he, out of boredom or otherwise, hones in on the apartment across the way. By the time Stewart and crew are done old Raymond Burr is going to need more than Perry Mason to get out of this fix. A word on Grace Kelly. They say Prince Rainer of Monaco, her husband, a man not known for showing emotion openly cried when she died in that car accident long ago. Now I know why. Enough said.$LABEL$1
More than a Mirage. When Transformers started relaunching G1 characters as modern, re-tooled versions in the Generations line I was stoked. Born in the early 80's I wasn't able to enjoy the original toys unless I went to older kid's houses. I loved the cartoon and the characters. Now with these toys, especially Mirage here, I'm able to enjoy and appreciate them as a homage as well as fully posable action figures that are able to capture the essence of the character in Robot mode as well as a realistic vehicle mode. Sweet!$LABEL$1
Deftly analyzes over 2,000 of Koryusai's designs. Isoda Koryusai produced thousands of designs between 1769 and 1781, a crucial period in the Japanese print tradition era, and though he was honored in Japan for his works, he's been largely neglected by western art scholars. Allen Hockley's The Prints Of Isoda Koryusai deftly analyzes over 2,000 of Koryusai's designs, surveying his influence as a minor Edo-period artist and arguing that Koryusai excelled in his output and his creation of popular commodities. The Prints Of Isoda Koryusai is essential reading for any student of Japanese printmaking history and artists.$LABEL$1

Practical help, step-by-step process.. This book takes you through all the details, big and small of setting up your own practice. Dr. Hunt explains her points concisely, with helpful anecdotes from personal experience. The book is very easy to read with easy to reference chapters and section highlights. There are useful templates in the back for finances, intaking, and forcasting future needs. I found this book to be one of the most useful books in getting started. Even if you are a seasoned private practictioner, this book can help you streamline and cut costs even more, or simply be a fresh reminder.$LABEL$1
A true Inspiration. This album was truly in inspiration. William belted his heart out in "I Believe I can Fly", and "Can You Feel the Love Tonight". His voice was that of an angel sent from up above. Y.M.C.A had me dancing in my car on the way to work.....I have listened to William's album everyday from the day I bought it, and that was several weeks ago. William's unique and powerful has definently changed the music industry. If you do not own this album you should go out and buy it today. Go William!!!!$LABEL$1

A Beautifully Overrated Gem. Perhaps if the book had not received the prize and so much praise I would have been pleasantly surprised, but after all the hype I would tend to agree with the dissenters here below, that The Hours, although superbly crafted and elegantly written, is a hollow and ultimately disappointing reference to Virginia Woolf's masterpiece. Cunningham's prose moved me, but his invented characters did not. (Of course Virginia herself is untouchable.) I am puzzled, still, at my disappointment; have I missed something, or am I merely more discerning, wary of the aura of prize-winning?$LABEL$0
Crap, crap and more crap. I should have believed all the other reviews. Broke off the first time Grandma tried to open the closet and didnt' realize we had a lock on it.

Vapid and inane. A total embarrassment to the author. Dull and poorly written. After forcing myself to get through the first 45 pages, I gave up. This book is perhaps faithful to the A&E movie---certainly not to the original Austen book. It has Bingley as OWNER of Netherfield (he is only renting it!) and ignores the fact that the BENNETS are the first family of the village; hence Caroline would have had to socialize with them whether she wanted to or not---certainly before accepting an invitation from Colonel Forster!! This is only the beginning of the ludicrous inaccuracies. The book is also dreadfully copy-edited; I found the same kinds of errors my high school students routinely make. Reviewers who raved about this just aren't very discriminating.$LABEL$0

Poorly Made. Immediately upon assembly, we found this product to be poorly made. The mesh above the lamp was so poorly designed that it could not be reapplied after the bulb was inserted.

An insult to the legacy of James Brown. This concert is obviously being marketed by it's historical context, taking place on the night after Dr. King's assassination. It is also a good performance by James Brown, but then, he never put on a bad show. However, the lighting of the DVD is so bad it's almost un-watchable. It's amazing it was shown on television that night because it looks like it was shot in a coal mine! If James Brown was still alive he would never have authorized this DVD, because he always took pride in his product and his responsibility to his fans. If you must have this concert just get the CD because the visuals are atrocious!$LABEL$0
Wenzel Insta-Flex Queen Airbed with Pump. This bed was absolutely dreadful. The bed popped a hole along the seam after a mere couple of weeks. We tried to patch up the hole, but it kept getting larger and we had to replace the bed. I can only tell you to be careful if you buy this bed and keep your receipt. Our mattress is headed for the trash recycle bin, where it belongs. Shame on you Wenzel for selling such a bad product. Amazon customers beware of this product!$LABEL$0
Simply does not work on new Mac's. I have no doubt that at one time Final cut 4 was a great product. But beware to those that have new Mac's with Intel chips.

But if you have bought a new Mac you will need to look at getting newer software.$LABEL$0
Another great model from Tamiya. I love Tamiya models they find the right spot of easy to build while still having a good amount of challegen to them. This is a great model of a German 88. The only problem I have with it is the men keep falling over. But beyond that its a great models. Keep in mind this is not a toy. You have to put it togeother yourself and paint it yourself. If you like that. You can never good wrong with a Tamiya model.$LABEL$1
Great toy!. I bought this for a joined Christmas present for my 3 and 4 year old, not sure whether it was going to be a bust or something that they could really enjoy at such a young age. My 3 year old has a little trouble getting more complex structures built because of how strong the magnets are, but my 4 year old LOVES them. She has declared them her favorite toy of the holiday, and plays with them constantly. The magnets are of such great quality, and are built to last. Even though you are only given the little bars and the silver balls, the possibilities are endless. They come packaged great, so it's easy to tell if any pieces have gone missing. I would recommend this to anyone. More than just the average toy you find nowadays, where lights and sounds and flashy things replace quality and actual entertainment value!$LABEL$1
A Welcome Change in Sytemic Thinking. This book presents a revolutionary, yet simple thesis on the Bible's teaching about "divorce." For too many years churches have burdened divorced individuals with the feeling that they are somehow now "disqualified" because of it. Divorce has been treated as an almost "unpardonable sin." Callison's book dispells this attitude and belief by simply pointing out the translations of the O.T. Hebrew words and the N.T. Greek words used for "bill of divorce" and "putting away." It is a welcome message that should help countless divorced people regain the joy of their relationship with God.$LABEL$1
Best for the Price. I highly recommend the HT-DDW900. Excellent Home theater system in the ~$250 price range. Plenty of power for my needs (16 x 16 room). Must read the owners manual to understand the system as most functionality is configured through the remote control... definitely a bit more complicated system setup than my old Home Theater system. The setup microphone is useful if you don't want to bother to learn the remote.$LABEL$1

Conscience of a Conservative. I was very discusted with the book itself. This is not an original but a copy made and very poorly bound duplicate. It was sold as a used copy but this did not mean a duplicate copy. This was a new copy. The price was high for a duplicate. It missed all normal identification of publisher etc that would be carried in an original. The content is that of the Goldwater, not great, but what I wanted. I really should have returned the copy because it was not as advertised. The original should really be in historical class and currently is not easy to find in many public libraries.$LABEL$0
OK. if you have seen the other total recal you don;t need to watch this one, not sure why they copied the original$LABEL$0
A Great, Great, Movie. Wow, what A Great, Great, Movie. I loved everything about Thor, the movie was excellent from beginning to end. The writing alone pulls you in and makes you care. Despite being set on multiple planets, all planets involved, thanks to amazing special effects, brilliant acting, and clever writing, are incredibly believable and real. The movie has humor, scares, bonus characters, tie ins with other movies, and an overall compelling story line. Chris Hemsworth is excellent as Thor, Natalie Portman delivers a great performance as well, and Kenneth Branagh does an amazing job directing the film. This movie is worth your time and money, and is definitely a film to watch over, and over again.$LABEL$1
absolute garbage. Bought a big box of these.Tried 4 pairs while winter hiking and I got one pair to almost get lukewarm for about 2 minutes.It did that probably because of the effort I put into shaking it and rubbing it around my freezing hands.Save your money and buy something else like wool mits.

Just Gotta Love the Speedway. This watch adjusts well, fits great, looks good, keeps good time, and is good for dress or play. Sooooo what more do you want in a watch in this price range. I only hope Invicta gets it's head out of it's you know what and goes back to what really works. If they don't they will be sorry for the new speedways are nothing like these. The reserves, grand diver, and this are all what's great about the speedway line. So get yours soon for they are not making these anymore.$LABEL$1
baby proof. A well written story about a couple who both do not want to have children. However, after marriage and time one of them decides they changed their mind.

Whoever loves magneto should read this.. You see here a lot of things happen, Magneto gets an asteroid city called Avalon for mutant to live in, Bishop and Cable come back, they almost get killed, Wolverine's adamantium gets ripped out of his bones by Magneto and his powers, Charles Xavier gets angry like he did when he turned into onslaught and using his powers left Magneto brainless, not including a shocing betrayal by one of the X-men and also an abandoning by another X-man. You really ought to read this book.$LABEL$1
Dissapointing. I feel I must agree with Greg B. To say a movie wasn't good because it wasn't the same as the book it was based upon is ridiculous, for film must follow different conventions than the written word. HOWEVER, that maxim is true only most of the time. Sometimes, what was left out of a film in the transfer from book to screen would have made a better cinematic impression . Such is the case with "A Simple Plan". Scott Smith more than likely felt compelled to water down his novel to fit Hollywood's narrow views of what makes a successful movie. He probably felt he had managed to still retain the spirit and impact of the book. Sorry,Scott, but I disagree. It was bungled badly, and what could have been a truly chilling morality tale ended up a by the numbers actiion thriller, with a thin moral fabric tacked on as an afterthought. Fair at best, only because a fine cast of actors save what should have rated zero stars. A dissapointment.$LABEL$0

predictable, pedestrian mystery. This "femjep" mystery has all of the flaws of a beginning effort and few of the charms. The focus is really on the relationship between reporter Irene Kelly and detective Frank Harriman. Solving the mystery is almost incidental. And Irene doesn't do much investigating. Things happen to her and she overlooks obvious clues (e. g., the cable truck sitting outside her house for several days). She finds herself in far more physical danger than any one person would face in a lifetime, and yet the solution to the crime pops up when she isn't even looking for it. Burke has an annoying habit of trying to misdirect the reader -- which a mystery writer is supposed to do -- but in such a heavy-handed way that no reasonably intelligent reader is going to be fooled.$LABEL$0

Authentic powerful blend of traditional songs and creativity. Picked this CD up at Wupatki National Monument out west. The songs are based on traditional Hopi songs but with embellishments such as flute and occasional background nature sounds. A great mix of drumming, chanting, rattlework. Definately easier for most westerners to listen to than powwow songs. A bit more tribal than the latest Carlos Nakai but generally in that genree. Sounds somewhere between Nakai and Douglas Blue Feather. Really suprisingly great stuff.$LABEL$1

Fun little game. I love doing Jumbles - I buy all of the Jumble books I can find. The hand-held version is not as entertaining as the books because it doesn't have the cartoons, and you can't see the bonus puzzle letters until you get to the bonus puzzle, but for when you're on the road, it's better than lugging a book and a pencil. Very easy to use, and well made, though I wish the display was a little easier to read in dim light.$LABEL$1
Parent Trap, updated. What an adorable story.

Not What I Expected. Although the book is very interesting, it really didn't have in it what I thought would be in it. I actually bought the book for my husband, who is into model rocketry and is making his own rocket engines and I thought this book would be informative enough to teach him to make the black powder that goes in them. Well, it is...if you have ten years to wait for everything to cure and get to a point where it's "good" enough to use for black powder. I really did think he could put the knowledge he gained there to work immediately and therefore I was disappointed in the content of the book. If you have ten years to wait for everything to come together then this is a book for you. If you want to put the knowledge to work for you right away, forget it!$LABEL$0

My daughter and I LOVE this CD!. The songs on this CD are infectious and fun. There is not one annoying song on here. I love Willie the King, Snow Day, and The Hoppity Song the most. IF you're an adult that cringes at the idea of a kids' CD, this is absolutely the one for you!$LABEL$1

Very comfy!. These are the most comfortable character shoes I've ever owned! They are like putting your foot inside a pillow. The only down side is that the soles could be a little stronger.

But they are great for stage and dancing, just make sure to scuff up the soles before you do anything in them!$LABEL$1
Easy to pack. I have been traveling a lot to visit Grandchildren, etc. The Kindle is much easier to pack that a stack of books. It is great not having to worry about bookmarks falling out and finding my place again. The downloads are quick and easy. Bookmarking spots to return to are easy, too. I have a variety of books so I can read whatever I feel like. My kids are envious.$LABEL$1
DOA. Product DOA. Installed on an old PowerMac G4. Might as well have stuck a piece of toast in my machine. Bought a card from Circuit City (~$20) which immediately worked fine.

Worked great!. I had to do a few runs of Cat6 through my attic into 3 rooms in my home. This really helped a lot. Sure you could make your own or use a different kind of device (originally I used a wire hanger), but this did the job better. I was up in the attic and my wife was at the receiving end using the magnet to attach the nickel-plated steel ball chain. You might have issues if the wall you're working on is insulated or if you have horizontal studs/fire-stops. It was perfect for what I needed.$LABEL$1

Huge Hit.. FIRST IMPRESSION: This toy was a big hit with the kids the moment they tried it out.DURABILITY: Initially I thought it looked a bit flimsy, but it's been a while and everything is still intact and working perfectly.CUSTOMER SERVICE: The box was missing one item when it arrived. We called the company and got the part within the same week, with a few extra parts along with it. Customer service from that company is fantastic. They were very polite and resolved our problem right away.FUN FACTOR: The rockets go very high, and kids in our area congregate in our yard to have a turn at stomping. It really is a lot of fun for both kids and adults as well.RECOMMENDATION: Give it try. Most kids flip out for this toy.$LABEL$1
Waste of time. As others have found, this is the worst piece of junk that I have ever seen. Shame on ToysRUs for even carrying it.

Classic! Must read for everyone. I read this book in high school but when we decided to read this in my book club I realized I forgot almost the whole story line.

Seeing as how she's never been trained as a counselor she has undertaken a task she's incapable of finishing. This book left me feeling suicidal. If you're under any kind of stress at all? This is NOT the book for you. If you're looking for good advice? This is NOT the book for you.Basically? This book is a waste of time and money.$LABEL$0

Wonderful artwork!. This deck is not for someone who likes color. These drawings are wonderful and neutral in color. They are very Medieval in style and done by the late Brian Williams, who is one of my favorite Tarot card artists. If you are not a beginner and collect Tarot cards or are looking for something unusual - this deck is great.$LABEL$1
Scared Miss Muffet from the theater!. One of the most irreverent films. The characters in this film are 2-dimensional. The storyline is not that strong. The storytelling is choppy and disjointed. Some of the effects don't look too impressive because you can see that it's been computer generated.Kids will enjoy it for its sophomoric action. Not a film that will enrich the mind.$LABEL$0

Best Musical of the 50's. This is the movie that made me fall in love with Doris Day and Howard Keel. It was so much better than Annie Get Your Gun where Betty Hutton sang to herself or to the last row in the audience. There was so much chemistry and great songs. The Black Hills song is great and I thought all the songs were meant for Mr. Keel and Ms. Day. She was great in both "characters" and he is my hero! A must have.$LABEL$1

Cold and unmoving. In 1970, Twentieth Century Fox released "M*A*S*H," a huge box-office smash that put Elliott Gould on the map, and established Robert Altman, a veteran director of TV's "Bonanza," as one of the important figures of 1970's cinema. Much like Gould, Altman quickly burned out, and there's hardly a spark of imagination to be found in "Quintet."Set in some barren wasteland of the future, it involves a macabre twist on backgammon in which the loser is murdered. The location, a snow swept Montreal, and the contrasting claustrophobic interior scenes, are appealing to the eye, and the cast, headed by Paul Newman, is not without interest.But "Quintet" is as cold and unmoving as its landscapes, simply another credit in Altman's filmography that boasts of his maverick credentials, but makes you wonder why "maverick credentials" are something to boast about.Brian W.

Best soundtrack since Clueless. I've loved Howie Beno's work since he was in Drag/13mg, and his She Bop with Cruella DeVille is gutsy and aggressive. Yoo Hoo is an instant classic, and the scenes from the movie with them walking slow motion ala 'Suburbia' are forever linked in my mind.Transister's 'Flow' is a very sweet, sad song, very moving. Not since the Cure's 'Disintegration' have I gotten so choked up by a song.$LABEL$1
Amazing Durability!. I bought this camera for my daughter 2 years ago. My 3 kids play with it frequently. It has been dropped on the tile floor many times without breaking. Last week, my 3 year old son put the camera in the bathtub. It was completely submerged. You could see water inside the view finder and on the screen. I was certain it had finally met its demise. However, I took the batteries out and dried it as best I could for 5 days. Today, I put the batteries back in and much to my surprise it STILL WORKS!! Like most reviews say, the picture quality is not good. My daughter gets frustrated with blurry pictures if she is not holding the camera completely still. But, man, is this thing ever tough!$LABEL$1
The real thing. Aside from the a young man's bravery this movie reminds about the communism. People tend to forget the history, that is why we have so many repeats. I am a Bulgarian and in 1952 I was only 4, but I could not agree more with the movie, at the same time recommend it to anyone. Anyone who cherishes the freedom the way it should be cherished.$LABEL$1

This is the version you want.. IF YOU SAW THE EX IN THE THEATRE AND LOVED IT, THIS IS THE VERSION YOU WANT! THIS IS THE VERSION THAT WAS SHOWN IN THE THEATRE. The unrated version has a lot of material cut out, including a lot of character development and stuff that made the movie funny in the first place. This PG-13 version is 5 minutes longer than the unrated. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that this rated version is available in widescreen at this time.$LABEL$1
No warmer on pot. I bought this tea pot 1 month ago and I have not been happy with it. The biggest reason that I bought a tea pot is becasue I drink a lot of tea and I hate to have to get up an leave my desk to make another cup of tea. I thought that I would have a whole pot of hot water by my desk. Alas, this pot does not keep the water hot like a coffee pot! By the time I finish drinking my first cup and go for a refill the water is already luke warm and cold by the third cup :-(I should have just bought a coffee pot becasue it keeps the water hot for a couple hours.$LABEL$0

Very Simple. If I had a ten year old interested in WHY a surfboard is made to look the way it does then this would be the book for him/her.

Library. I bought this book for my boyfriend and I and it was from a library and tape was all over it. Pages are not damaged, just the stamp of the library. One annoying thing happened when I went to my library and it set off alarms.$LABEL$1
too wordy. I found this book much to wordy to actually be helpful. It seems like the author was more interested in being witty and cracking jokes than in providing cold, hard facts. Although some of the stories are entertaining, I would have welcomed something with a more serious and mature tone. I found myself skimming through most of the anecdotes, in an effort to get to the real information.$LABEL$0

A FIVE STAR SONG A TWO STAR ALBUM. As many fellow reviewers assert, there's only one real reason to own this history-making CD: the nearly 17 minute version of LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY.The irresistibly danceable disco-erotica features Donna's moans and groans but it's the structuring of the glorious music that makes this such an awesome track. Each section has its own unique feel, culminating in the choral climax (no pun intended!) and a return to the whispery sparse opening, and then another choral eruption. Probably the best disco recording ever!The rest of the album is basically boring pap...but Donna's voice prophesies her future vocal triumphs.The aforementioned 17 minutes makes this a must-have for discophiles.$LABEL$1
it's OK. For the price I am disappointed the straps don't go all the way around the bag, thus the straps could pull out. But the size, color and material used was of good quality. I think it's a bit overpriced for what you get and I will be continuing my search. I embroder our bags for our guests as a gift. My prior bags all had a small zipper pocket on the inside and I would like to return to that style.$LABEL$1
This item is not worth ordering.. I Orded two of these mirrors for Christmas presents and am sending both of them back. The mirror material is cheap and makes the mirror distorted.

Scarlet Feather. (This review refers to the abridged audio cassette version). This is not one of Maeve Binchy's best books. It is a boring story about a catering company called "Scarlet Feather".

Very Disappointed. What a waste of a few hours of my life! I thought I would get a few laughs from Janet E., even though I knew it wouldn't be the same as the Plum series...what a joke.

Too Much Allegory... Read Love Wins Instead. I tried to get into this literary classic and just couldn't quite understand it. It came highly recommended to me by a friend of mine because he knew I had just read and enjoyed Rob Bell's, "Love Wins". Apparently Lewis and Bell think similarly on issues relating to Heaven, Hell, and the afterlife. But, there was just too much use of allegory and symbolism in "The Great Divorce" that I couldn't bring myself to finish it simply for a lack of understanding on my part. If I can't understand a book then I don't see the sense in continuing to read it. And, so I reluctantly stopped reading this one about halfway through. If you have no problem understanding allegory, then I recommend this book. But, if you are like me and find it difficult to understand allegory, then save yourself the time and read Love Wins instead.$LABEL$0
Craniosacral Therapy. This book was very helpful in presenting alternatives to traditional medicine for a variety of health issues.$LABEL$0
Worthless drivel. I have to agree with the many readers who loathed this book. I have read a great deal of fantasy and sci/fi and in comparison, this story seemed dull and boring. With the thinly detailed characters and the predicatible plot I found myself tuning out and having to read pages again. I was sorely disappointed by this one. I kept waiting for something to be interesting, but it never happened. I won't even bother to read the third one. Unfortunately, I don't care what happens to these characters.$LABEL$0
Ricks has broken the code. Remarkable: a reporter who apparently has no military service but demonstrates an unusual understanding of the military and its many subcultures. From a purely literary standpoint it's journeyman stuff; only a few minor characters really flesh out to three dimensions, and the plot goes off the rails at the end. But the novel's main conceit (an e-mail revolution within the US Army officer corps) and its principal theme - where does duty lie? - are well-developed. Military officers should read this book.$LABEL$1

My First Anita Shreve novel-My last. As an avid reader, I have always prided myself on getting through books quickly, thoroughly, and always shutting the final page with a satisfied sigh and a feeling of wonderment. There has been only one exception-this novel. I found it very difficult to get through, as the narrator is a despicable bore. Although Anita Shreve portrays the Victorian era very well, I found the descriptions to be dry and lacking in imagination. The beginning and middle lasted far too long, and the ending was too short,although I was grateful that my misery was finally at an end. This was my first Anita Shreve novel and as other reviewers have described this work as one of her best, it is sure to be my last.$LABEL$0
A great, great astrology book. Definitely one of my favorites. Carol Rushman shares from her astrological wisdom and experience, cases and techniques that help the reader get a good insight not only on the theoretical astrology, but also on the practical approach to predictive astrology.This book changed my approach to predictive astrology and has sharpened my astrological tools.It is very accesible to all readers, from beginners to advanced students of astrology.$LABEL$1
this is trash. ok i know bands are supposed to evolve into newer sounds. however, they've completely lost that gritty sound that made them so appealing, the lyrics are mediocre at best (esp bev. hills & we are all on drugs are painful to listen to) and the album lacks the intensity of several of the previous ones. and i have a high tolerance for crappy weezer. of course i liked blue and pinkerton best. but i liked maladroit too! and even green! but this is marginally acceptable. Rivers Cuomo is essentially mocking me because i know he can do better and he isn't, on purpose, just to piss me off. I mean, i heard they picked from over 200 songs the ones that go on this album, and that makes me wonder what the rejected songs sound like (really really bad?) and how much time they actually spend on each song. Like it'd be impressive if the album was good, but it's not.$LABEL$0
NOT a feelgood movie but a must see. If there ever was a more powerful movie than this I have yet to see it. I have seen this movie several times since it's release in 1983 and the effect has always been the same. You go to bed and it replays in your head then you wake up and it dominates your entire following day. With performances so powerful from Jane Alexander and others that you will never forget. Also this movie makes use of scenes with children asking their innocent questions as they do that will tear your heart apart as they are among the first to succumb to the radiation sickness. So if you want to see a film that will be hard to shake from your memory for weeks but will not leave you feeling particularly happy this is the ticket. I personally think it should be required viewing in all schools across America to remind our young that there are some things much more important than the latest Britney and N' Sync releases.$LABEL$1
Amazing toy for playing with electricity. This toy is so awesome! Honestly, when I play with this toy with my 6 year old niece, I have more fun then her. I think she's probably too young for it. Probably this is the best educational toy I've ever seen, in my entire life! It's so cool! It seriously has all of the functionality of the sold school soldering boards, with no mess! And you can play with it FAST! You can take it out, play with it, and put it away in 10 or fifteen minutes! It's so EASY to have fun with this toy!$LABEL$1
Nice stand, no really... Nice Stand..... I use this mic stand for a Shure PG58 mic and it works perfect for my particular DJ setup - reaching over and around the rest of my gear to my face. It is sturdy and well made... The only minor issue I have with it is the weight of the mic sometimes causes the stand to tip a little, but turning it slightly or adjusting it some fixes it no problem.$LABEL$1
Glad I bought it.. So far I have made a skirt and a top and now I am making another skirt. I have tied on new thread and re- threaded the machine from scratch.

It does the job and I didn't spend a lot of money. I love getting value for my hard eared dollars and I'm glad that this is so easy to get up and running.$LABEL$1
Amerigel Wound Dressing. My husband first used Amerigel Wound Dressing after his Podiatrist provided it to him for a toe infection. After I read the ingredients, I was sceptical that it would be effective. Then he an unexpected,unrelated medical problem with the foot itself, which required surgery, leaving a large surgical wound. I used the Amerigel Wound Dressing and was amazed how well the wound healed. At a post-op checkup with the surgeon, he said to me, "That's Good Stuff". It is necessary to use the AmeriGel wound Dressing daily, until the wound heals, which can vary from person to person. I have purchased several tubes and highly recommend this product.$LABEL$1
Pretentious and boring.. This magazine is really horrendous--long, wandering, and pedantic articles guaranteed to make you sleep. The most recent issue has a rather pointless story on what kind of debaters Obama and Romney are and how they will most likely fare against each other. After endless paragraphs we finally learn that Obama is a pretty good debator, by God, and that Romney is too. But here's the big dramatic point: Romney sometimes gets flustered when he debates. Stop the presses!A second article goes over familiar territory: if you're against Obama, you're a racist. Except in this case, the writer really means it. You can't say anything bad about Obama because he's black and most likely you aren't. So stop complaining about him. Because if you do, you're a racist.Why would anyone pay a subscription for this kind of stuff?$LABEL$0

Recommended for insomniacs. One of the previous reviews, defensive, spiteful and jealous in tone - Colson Whitehead really IS all that - reads as though it was written by the author himself. Anyone who reads Black Issues Book Review magazine knows what's hot and what's not in the black literary world. As it is, the title of this book very aptly describes what happens when any reader of the male gender picks it up and tries to read it: HE SLEEPS. This one should be recommended for insomniacs.$LABEL$0
Kind of suckie. If my feet could stay in the foot pads and stop coming out after the velcro comes loose maybe I could get a work out from this product.

Wish me luck!$LABEL$0

Written well... with distasteful content. I personally did not enjoy this book. In fact, i found the content to have some what traumatized me. Seriously, I do wish i hadn't exposed myself to such vile, disturbing details in which he describes his "Sex life." Purely disgusting and unimportant. Nevertheless i read on, hoping to find an ending worthwhile, only find the book ending abruptly without satisfying me. I almost thought about burning it when i was finished reading it, as to spare someone from such nastiness. Instead, I traded it at a book store for another book. In a word - yuck.$LABEL$0

Collimation Easily Done. When I received it the collimation was off. Rather than send it back and risk getting another pair that was off, I called Celestron. The "Life Time No Fault Warranty" only applies if you get it from an "authorized" dealer even though my pair was new. Which means you need to pay like $200+ for these to actually have a warranty. However I asked if I could collimate it myself even though the manual says it should only be done by a professional with specialized tools. They could not or would not tell me anything about how to collimate it. Luckily I did find some general instructions on the web and found the prism tilt screws to turn and got it perfect. You need to gently pry back the edge of the rubber hand grips to access the screws. It whole process wasn't even that difficult! I don't know why it has to be such a state secret with Celestron. Since then the binos have been wonderful and well worth the discount of buying from an "unauthorized dealer".$LABEL$1
It was great!. I read this book a few months after it came out and have recommended it to many since. The story takes place in the San Francisco bay area and makes its way to the pacific coast and all the way to eastern Canada. During this story I thought the 'psycho' nephew Nicholas was the main charactor. He fit in perfectly, The story is about his Aunt (who is in a bad marriage) and who falls head over heals for an eligible bachlor -- a pianist who is gay. I think everyone in this story had 'a few screws loose'. This made the story all the more pleasing because in everyone's life there are people like this.The main charactor turns out to be Nicholas's aunt Joyclyn. The ending may surprise you. This is a book to read on a recliner, when ou just feel like letting go of your troubles and reading about the zaniness that others possess. A strong recommendation$LABEL$1
pretty nice. I haven't had any trouble standing this up and don't find it cheap looking at all. I use it as decoration in my room and to hide my hamper and it has been great. Have had it for a year, light portable and pretty! It's true, the material they used is a little weird and I'm sure there might be something more fabulous out there but this is definitely better priced and better looking than stuff i've seen laying around at target walmart and similar stores.$LABEL$1

Awesome shaver!!!. This is one of the best shavers on the market. Whatever they say about Norelco being the best,I think Panasonic rocks when it comes to shavers. My husband's been using a 7xxx model for 3 years now and I decided to buy a new, more advanced, model for him since he's been kind of reluctant to shave lately. And, needless to say, I like him better with smooth and soft shaved skin...The result- he's been shaving every 2 days thanks to the fact this model makes less noise, has a great easy-grip design, recharges incredibly quickly and looks cool in the bathroom (Men love beautiful toys- from Gameboy Advance to Pro Curve shavers.) I'll buy him more Panasonic products in the future; recommend you to do the same; won't regret it!!!:)You'd ask "why 4 stars, then?" Well, lets leave some room for more HiTech advances...$LABEL$1
Not that great- not worth the time. I had to read this book for a 7th grade report, and belive me, it was terrible. The whole school hated it, all the teachers too-except the ones who taught literature. Is this some universally bad book for kids, and great book for adults into literature? I strongly object one of the other reveiws,the one who says kids who don't like this book haven't read "great literature." I love to read, and even though Western novels aren't my favorite, I do know the difference between a good book and a bad one- this was clearly one bad book. Many reviewers say this book was too descriptive. It definatly was, but that is not a major reson to dislike this book. The major thing was that it was too boring, I couldn't read more than ten pages before starting to skip words, sentences, even paragraphs.$LABEL$0

Great survival product. This is a great survival product and works very well if you know how to use it. I actually bought two, one for practice and one for emergencies. This product will work even if wet, however I would only really use it as a last resort fire starter because lighters that you buy from the store do the same thing at a cheaper price. Nonetheless it is a good product to have on you for emergencies. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't come with a striker.$LABEL$1
Everything's forgettable but the ending. Watching Remember Me is a strange and frustrating experience.For most of the time, it's a generic romantic movie about a brooding and troubled guy (Robert Pattinson) falling in love with a cute blonde (Emile de Ravin) and how that love helps lift him out of his funk to become the man we always knew he could be. It's crap, but it's well crafted crap.[...]$LABEL$0
Following in the trail. After reading this book I had to return to the scene of the crime.As a lover of Provence, I headed first to the local cafe in Maussane where all the regulars discussed this terrible misdeed.I eyed every gypsy suspiciously, wondering if they were the culprit. After a few more Pastis, I thought about the day he was finally returned to his loving home. Yo-yo in Provence is in my heart.$LABEL$1

First of all they were too small and I am having to buy a whole new pair, a different shoe altogether because I was not thrilled with these.They have a smooth rubber sole instead of the hard leather you normally find in character shoes.The upper material does not give very well which makes breaking them in next to impossible.$LABEL$0

Stick with VHS!. These films are all 5-star classics so surely they deserve better treatment than has been meted out here. The picture quality is appalling, the synchronisation poor, and the sound barely audible.

do not buy this comforter!. This comforter is a dud. It is advertised light weight because there is such a minimal amount of down. The cover is not white it is grey. It may have baffle box construction but the edges are cheaply made (not gusseted as would be expected on baffle box construction). This would have been our 3rd comforter in 43 years. Our 1st 2 were beautiful, plump, soft treasures and I was very excited about getting number 3 but now I am just very annoyed. I had it shipped 1-2 days shipping (not cheap) and now I have to send it back plus they do not honor Amazon Prime Shipping Think this time I am just going to buy from a Name Brand REPUTABLE company. If this is "Warm Things" Supremium, that being the best they have, we don't need them. Pacific Coast and Lands End make a beautiful product...may look at them again and The Company Store is very good also. Don't make the same mistake I did-$LABEL$0

Lousy, Blurry, and returned for a refund. I bought this at CVS because we needed one immediately, to figure out if we should take our 3 year old to urgent care or wait and see if she was better in the morning. For the price, I knew/assumed it would be cheaply made, but hoped it would be adequate for the job. It was anything but. It's nothing but a penlight with a piece of mylar foil to reflect the light. Could not get the ear in focus at all, and it was difficult to keep turned on since you have to press and hold the pocket clip into the side of the light to turn it on. Never did see how my daughter's ear looked until we took her to the doctor and looked through his professional W/A unit.I also tried it on our 5 year old and my wife's ear, but had no better luck there. Returned it for a refund, and am now looking for a better unit to have for next time.$LABEL$0
Self important and boring. No one can deny that this film is stunningly beautiful. The Montana scenery all captured by fine photography is wonderful. But, unfortuanately that's all the film has going for it. The acting is good and it's certaintly interesting to see Pitt, (looking alot like the young Redford), in his first major screen role but no one really makes much impression. Basically this is self important, one note movie about the susposed joys of family love brought together by the dullest of sports, fishing, with little plot, humour or suspense. The strikingly similar "Legends of the Fall" is much better.$LABEL$0
Interesting Series. I don't subscribe to HBO but heard lots of good things about the series. So far I am enjoying it alot.$LABEL$1
Idina Menzel - Still I Can't Be Still Bomb!!. Idina (Adena) Menzel's newest album, Still I Can't Be Still, is hip, up-beat, and great to listen to with your Man.. Or Woman. The songs are great. The beat is great, and the Lyrics are a work of art themselves!$LABEL$1
Kovels' Dictionary of Marks -- Pottery And Porcelain : 1650 to 1850 (Kovel's Dictionary of Marks). Overall it is helpful. I am really just getting into this, so it is great to have something I can refer to to get an idea of where the item I have comes from.$LABEL$1
Perfect Wrap for a mild to cool day!. Love these wraps. I have officially ordered 7 from this vendor. I LOVE THEM. Super cute, bright colors that pop with everything that I wear. It's great to wrap up in at the office when it gets chilly. Light weight and nice. I always receive compliments when I wear them. I plan on buying more.$LABEL$1
This CD was compiled by Vanilla Ice...... Where's Eric B. & Rakim? Where's Big Daddy Kane? Where's Public Enemy? Where's BDP? I'll house you?? That's not even hip hop, that's HOUSE MUSIC!!! The Cd is wack...you'll get bored after the first two tracks...don't spend your money...$LABEL$0
I GIVE IT AN 8 BUT NOT 10 !. I must say that this is a good book for everyone who want to learn JAVA. But I am sorry to say that this book is only a refrence for JAVA but not a bible for JAVA. I have to say that because in this book the authors only briefly show the way to compile the source code and not explain it in detial. This problem may be seem is minor, but for a new programmer this is a great problem. This is because when we save our file with the .java, what appear in the screen is another name. For example if the programmer save the file as MyFile.java, the name that appears in the screen is MyFi~1.jav, so he will compile it with "javac MyFi~1.jav" because this is file that show in the screen. In this section, I think the way that presented by the book "Teach yourself JAVA in 21 days" is better. I hope that the authors can take note about it and have a great improvement in the next book. Finally I would like to say this is a good book but a perfect one !$LABEL$1
The One & Only. What can I say. This book is the camera collectors Bible. In short, if you sell or collect antique cameras you must own this book.$LABEL$1
Tedious and predictable. Based on a very weird premise, Willis tries for tension but achieves only tedium. The characters are not plausible, the plot is too easy to predict, and the whole is unsatisfying.I just hope I never have a near-death experience. I wouldn't want to run into any of the cardboard characters in this book.$LABEL$0
The author is very ignorant.... This book is very ignorant of the Seventh-day Adventist Doctrines and belief systems. After reading the first chapter, I quickly discovered that this man has very little knowledge (if any) of the subject. What a complete waste of money! If you do read this book, make sure that you check out Amazon's refund policy first!$LABEL$0
I Was a Teenage Bloodsucker.... Sabella is the coming-of-age story of a confused young vampire on Novo Mars. Like many of Lee's books, this one is dream-like and full of supernatural eroticism.Unfortunately, it is almost painfully slow and the first person narration was not very illuminating. I (finally) reached then end of the book and felt like I did not know the characters at all.$LABEL$0
Not the Black Mark verison. Like the other 1 star reviews this is just for the fact that this is not the Black Mark "666" issue.The bonus song is the one minute or so of the low groaning/chant sound that ends other bathory CD's.On the good side the songs match the Table of contents unlike some of the Black Mark Cd's.The cover work for Odin's Wild Hunt is off color and no CD information.The other side of the cover is black.This is a not a bootleg and if you buy a used copy of the Black Mark reissue listed in Amazon make sure it isn't a Kraze Manufactured CD.These review will show up in 3 places just make sure the Cd you are going to order has Black Mark Germany as record label.It will have the lyrics and catalog number BMCC666-4(Black Mark Compact Disc ,fourth release) when you get it.$LABEL$0
Fascinating Read.... I was actually taken aback after reading this. A very difficult book to discredit as the writing within these pages are too 'real' and very much sing some kind of truth. Venomous ? The author would not have any real motive to exaggerate or dress up any story but tell it like it is as they say in NYC ! I read this really quickly and I couldn't put it down when I started. The actual read itself is like watching film footage it's that real sounding. Fred ? I believe him... However it was a long time ago, people can and often do change. The principal point is that there are disturbed people on the loose out there with easy access to weapons and a warped bonding with fame which terrifies some high profile celebs etc. The book for me concludes that no-one won in the end, but even then, the fans (shortened term for fanatic I might add!)continue to haunt Yoko at times.$LABEL$1
Great Service. The product was shipped quickly and arrived just in time for my Mom's Birthday. Thanks!$LABEL$1
Undiscovered Pop Genius. R. Stevie is phenomenal. Nobody else tries so many different ideas on a single album and suceeds like R. Stevie. From polished pop to experimental noise rock, he covers all the bases! Enigmatic! Essential! If you don't own an R. Stevie Album, then you aren't truly a music fan...yet.$LABEL$1
Sturdy but smelly. I bought this item for transporting around 100-lb load. It works very well. However, the rubber on the two wheels emits strong pungent chemicals that give me serious headaches. I have to store it on my balcony and keep spraying Clorox. After weeks the smell was subdued a little bit. Buyers beware if you have little kids, animal, or sensitive house members.$LABEL$0
Great for amateurs, but not for professional photogs.. This book seems to get overall good scoring, so i'll be somewhat contrarian here, and mark it down, simply because it should specify if the book is for amateurs or professionals.Whilst it's all you need to get going in food photography if you're beginner to photography, it is of no help to professionals.$LABEL$0
Mary Kay Oil Control Lotion. This product is not for someone who blots more than twice a day. The Mary Kay Oil Mattifier is much much better. For really oily skin like mine this product was NOT effective whatsoever at minimizing shine. I still had to blot around 10-12 times a day (average). This product seems more suited for someone who may be shiny during summer months but fine the rest of the year. Definately NOT for someone who experiences oiliness & shine all year round!$LABEL$0
Not Squirrel proof. I have had this feeder for about a year. The squirrels have figured out how to lift the top and climb inside then proceed to clean out the feeder completely. In addition, they have somehow managed to bend the metal "perch" feeder area so that even when they step on it, it doesn't completely close and they have access to the food. Stop-A-Squirrel feeders are much better.$LABEL$0
Angry book by an angry man. I hated this book. I wanted to read it because a have a couple of family members with addiction problems who recovered on their own without AA. The author's style of writing is terrible and I think his story could have been told just as well without the choppy sentences and probably a record number of F words in any book I have ever read. I also don't beleive the story of the dental procedures done without any novocane. Sounds like something from "Marathon Man". If he had had a ruptured appendix, would they have removed it without any anesthesia? A person can go into shock from pain and I have never heard of the use of novocane triggering any relapse in an addict. After all, it is injected into the nerve, not the bloodstream.$LABEL$0
Time for Metallica to retire.. I would like to say that I used to be a huge Metallica fan. Kea, Rtl, MoP, AJfA were amazing albums. Even the black album had it's moments. I was hoping that this record would return the band to it former glory (for me anyway). I was wrong. The album sounds like a demo and the engineering is horrible. Also, I dont know what Lars was trying to do with his drumming. There is an effect on the snare drum that is not only annoying, but down right distracting. They lyrics and choruses are also sub par. However, the guitars on this album are great. Very kill em all , old school metal sounding. Buttom line is that it is time for Metallica to retire.$LABEL$0
Trace. This book is definitely not worth buying. While Scarpetta skill returns a bit in Trace, it is not enough to carry the wispy plot. Marino has become a completely reinvented character. Anyone who read the earlier books will not recognize him. I agree that Ms Cornwell should read her earlier work. Lucy is a complete enigma in this story. What is the point of including her?$LABEL$0

Simply fabulous.. I know Iced Earth since two or three months and i'm already a big fan! Alive In Athens is purely a masterpiece, and is going to become a classick.

A Real Pot Boiler. Great effort for a first solo book. I have enjoyed the books written with James Patterson so eagerly awaited the release of The Blue Zone. I was not disappointed. A fast paced thriller which I had trouble putting down. This is the best compliment I could give a book. The characters were extremely well developed. I look forward to future books and Andrew Gross will be on my must read list from now on.$LABEL$1
Admirable attempt. This game has a decent premise, let the player run free while doing jobs for different factions. True, it's been done before, but never in a location such as this, everyone adds their own little tweaks. my biggest gripe with this game is that it looks horrible! i have a fairly nice gaming rig, athlon64 3700, 1gig corsair xms memory, geforce 7600 OC, as you can see, this rig isn't a puppy, i can run F.E.A.R, doom 3,far cry, half life 2, and oblivion at mid/high to high settings with almost no slowdown, this game looks like Morrowind and still slows down. The other thing is the voice acting, in the cinematics, it's ok, but in the actualy game itself, it sounds terrible. it's a game they could have done so much with, but for one reason or another, they didn't/couldn't. well, you all know how atari's been doing lately, and perhaps games like this are the result, or the cause.$LABEL$0
How did this pass through safety tests for kids?. After my 4-year old BEGGED me for this thing, I caved in and purchased it before Christmas. It took FOREVER to figure out how to get the springing mechanism to work. You have to push it down in such an awkward way that I kept having to push it down for him...which isn't much fun. Then in order to get the "jumping" action, you practically have to throw the thing and literally slam it into something in order for the jumping action to start. Oh, but wait, there's a little area underneath that little tiny fingers can get trapped into....he nearly lost his finger!!!! HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE UNSAFE toy. NOT FOR KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF 8. What a waste of money.$LABEL$0
The many many other reviews on this page are right. This card will let you down in the end. If only I'd read these reviews before I bought it. The night I got my GameCube back in March, I bought this memory card along with it, thinking it'd be great because it had so much memory space. And up till now, it was fine. But about 20 minutes ago, the card became corrupted. I tried shaking it, blowing off dust, trying different slots, selecting no on the "Would you like to format?" selection screen again and again, but nothing works. All my data is unusable now. My Sonic games, Metal Gear Solid: TTS, Super Mario Sunshine, all of it, unusable. Now all I'm left with is regret. As another one of the many many people who were duped into buying this piece of junk, all I can say is: DO NOT BUY THIS. I can't stress that enough. It's just not worth it.$LABEL$0
Love It!. I love my Breadman Panini Maker. This is so simple to use, lots of fun & grills sandwiches in no time! I used a french bread and filled the panini with cheeses, tomatoes, and meat (roasted tomato turkey breast for my husband & a honey ham for myself). Very yummy & the grill marks make it look just beautiful. I'm very happy with my purchase & highly recommend this Breadman Panini Maker. I was leary at buying the smaller price Panini maker but after receiving & using this I was very surprised! It's huge, very heavy, & makes perfect Panini sandwiches. An awesome value for an awesome price, you don't have to spend tons of money on the more expensive ones when this one goes beyond 100%! What are you waiting for? You're still here reading this? Go add this to your shopping cart now! :oD$LABEL$1

This is a puzzle in disguise. This book is neither a novella or novel; rather it is an intricate puzzle in the form of a book. Who are the abos? The shoadw children?

Each time you read it, you find a new piece to the puzzle.$LABEL$1

Brilliant and gripping. As always, author Daniel Silva has crafted a compelling story in THE CONFESSOR, bravely tackling a topic that is bound to be controversial.THE CONFESSOR again displays the careful and scholarly research that Silva's works always evidence. While the book is fiction, it is completely fact-based.Here, he has constructed a fictional tale revolving around a significant contrast. He distinguishes between the phony assistance that the Vatican pretended to the world to be giving, albeit passively, to the Jews of Europe during World War II and the active, but hidden, way in which the Church actually supported the Nazis.He examines the scholarly evidence in this murder mystery set in the present day. His story is gripping and compelling, so much so that a reader cannot wait to turn the next page.THE CONFESSOR proves that Daniel Silva must be included in any current list of that group of leading authors of thrillers.$LABEL$1
Outlander. I'm a huge fan of Jim Caviezel and, when I saw this on tv, I knew I had to have it. It's a bit corny in places but one of the better "8 PM SciFi Sat. movies". A good story to it and most of the acting is pretty good. I'm very happy with this purchase and, if you like Jim Caviezel or just a pretty good scifi movie, I'd recommend it.$LABEL$1

A great satire made by a great performance by Rachel Weisz. Fantastic satire about the minefield of relationships that really makes you think about the people around you. Rachel Weisz proves once again to be the best versatile actress we have around with a powerful performance that seduces as well as scares the willies out of you. She makes this film hands down with her talent and she will have you talking with your partner well after the film is over. The rest of the cast is just as great with Paul Rudd giving a great transformation on screen from geek to hunk. This was one of the best films that I have seen in a long time, and I hope Rachel Weisz and director Neil LaBute work together again.$LABEL$1
Muffin Tops Are The Best. Have you ever seen the Seinfeld episode about the muffin tops. While the episode was quite humorous, its absolutely true. The muffin tops are the best part of the muffin. This Roshco Top of Muffin Pan gives you what everyone realy wants-the muffin tops. Not only do you get wonderful domed muffin tops but they effortlessly slide right out of the non-stick pan. For anyone who has ever tried to peel the paper off a muffin or had their muffin bottoms stuck to the pan, this item is the one for you.$LABEL$1
A great subwoofer. We have a basic extensive system set up with a Yamaha HTR-5760 7.1 receiver, 2 x E90 towers, EC25 center channel, and a pair of E30 rear speakers. This sub is the perfect complement to anyone's component home audio system. It excells in music and movie experiences, and the variable crossover and volume is great to custom tune to each situation. I cannot think of a better sub for the price on the market. It truly carries a great smooth sound not found in smaller subwoofers, and is easily capable of pressurizing standard size rooms. I am extremely pleased with this product and recommend it to anyone who doesn't have the thousand to drop on the ones that the "number driven" stores try to sell. A must buy...$LABEL$1
Very Good !! must see movie. I picked this movie up at my local library last week and very much enjoyed it. I watched the movie, the extras, and the movie with commentary and enjoyed and learned from almost everything.This movie has such a clear explanation of the crisis of global warming and even why we have been so ignorant to it for all these years.One of the parts of this film that touched me personally was how some of the stars of the film have dealt with the struggle of getting the goverment to take action on global warming and how they deal with the thought of a possible loss. This film and another documentary on pbs helped me deal with my own frustrations about global warming and goverment inaction.P.S. This film has re-sparked my desire to get involved and do what I can.$LABEL$1
A Triumph. "An excellent book! A thorough, lively interpretation of how Europe got to where it is today and the struggles Europeans had to overcome, sometimes with US help but often in defiance of the USA. In addition to being well-researched, Hitchcock illuminates his themes with very telling details from everyday life and biographies of overlooked historical figures that inform his thesis. A brisk, well-informed counter to the usual Europe-bashing in today's media. Highly recommended."$LABEL$1
The Romantic Tradition. Wonderfully playing continuing the tradition of two of her teacher's, Rubenstien and Hess. Technically impeccable, grounded in the Russian tradition -- interpretatively simple and direct a la Artur, warm enveloping tone included. Having worked with her personally, I can assure you that you will be hard pressed to find much better on the market today from contemporary pianists, and it's a pity that this recording will most likely stay relatively unknown. Nonetheless, if you are reading this considering whether or not to purchase, I strongly urge you to do so; you will see that in this modern age, the Romantic School of piano playing lives on.$LABEL$1
Talented and then some!. It's not just because I've had the pleasure to know these guys, or because I sat thru hours of rehearsals and studio time, it's because of the talent, passion, and drive of these musicians that this is one of my favorite cd's ever and I still sing Surprise Party when I'm in the shower.

No more Pascal?!. This would be a 5-star IDE if not for Metrowerks' decision to drop Pascal support. That fact was unbeknownst to me when I bought this upgrade, which is now worthless because of my investment in Pascal-based legacy products.

Piece of Junk. I was a little skeptical when I bought this, and for good reason. It locks up the network connection after about 15 minutes of use.

Do not forget what was left out of Live at Luther College. As a devoted DMB fan, I have to admit Everyday has a tendency to make one apprehensive about the new edge to the band. However, after sinking into the music it is clear that the creative abilities of the band are alive and well. This studio release does not possess the standard acoustic guitar, sax, violin, base, and drum sound accustomed in their preceding albums. But, neither did Live at Luther College. DMB is making some personal musical breakthroughs with this latest effort, listening to the lyrics, chords, and instruments it is clear that the best is yet to come. Buy this album, imagine what it will sound like live with an acoustic guitar and enjoy.$LABEL$1

Radical is one thing, freakish is another. I admire Marc Minkowski and his excellent Louvre ensemble, but what was he thinking here? Except for a few numbers taken slower thn usual, his tempos race madly, to the point of freahishness. If you don't know what you're getting in for, every number will make you blink tiwce--it doesn't seem conceivable that a good musician would commit this kind of bizarre distortion on Handel, even in the name of authenticity. I guess the amazon reviewer considers 'radical' a word of praise, but not in this case. It's a shame that Minkowski's chorus and soloists are generally superior since they are asked to sing while chasing after a fire truck.I doubt that my opinion will be popular here, but newcomers might welcome the warning. To my ears, this Messiah is unlistenable.$LABEL$0
Needs Improvement. I was really excited to receive this product, but it didn't turn out as expected. I ordered the chrome and aluminum, in order to do the checker board pattern, but the chrome came in 4 x 4's and the aluminum in 6 x 6's. Several pieces were also scratched from poor packaging. Sheet material can be bought with protective film, and for the plated/painted parts, they need to be wrapped with something. This could be a great product, but its quality and delivery kills it.$LABEL$0

Warning to ordinary readers!. I am writing this review because I wish I had read one like it before I bought this book. The only reason to read this book is if your religious or other beliefs prevent you from reading a real thriller (such as one written by Thomas Perry or James W. Hall): one with well-drawn characters, realistic dialog, a plot-line free of contradictions, professionally edited, tighly written and with no glaring grammatical mistakes. If you don't care about those things, and if you can't abide even a hint of sex, profanity or bloodshed, and if you like to read about people praying every five pages, then this book is for you. And don't be misled (like I was) by the high reader rating - it's pretty obvious that most of them were planted.$LABEL$0

The Best Book on Characterization Ever Written!. This book was given to me on my birthday over twenty-seven years ago. I glanced at it briefly, and since that time it sat on my bookshelf gathering dust. What a mistake. Just the other day I was having some trouble with a story character, and piled it up with some others covering the same subject for later use. What a gold mine of incisive instruction! I can't put it down. Although written in 1942 (ironically the year of my birth), absolutely everything Ms. Elwood presents today is right on target. Writtten with step-by-step perfection, she teaches "show not tell" better than any "live" instructor I've ever sat under. You must have this book!$LABEL$1

This book scarred my 4-year-old.. I preface this by saying that every kid/parent has different preferences and I may not the best judge. But I just didn't understand this book.

Audio book by Nathaniel Parker: Charlie Higson: Blood Fever. Listening to any audio book read by Nathaniel Parker is always a joy. This Young Bond story turns out quite sinister including lots of killings of more or less innocent people (which to my knowledge is the tendency of the adult James Bond stories,too). The plot is altogether clever, compelling and surprising to the very end. The story starts with an idyllic scene in the Greek archipelago and gets soon to Eton College from where some boys and teachers James Bond including travel for the summer holiday to the island of Sardinia and get involved with art thieves, pirates and bandits. The course of events is directed by the local rich lunatic who naturally wants even more power over other people and helds as a prisoner the compulsory young beautiful English girl for James Bond to rescue.Nathaniel Parker as the reader makes this story even more live and exciting by his marvelous characterizations and strong empathizing with the interpretation.$LABEL$1
Not Great. This wagon isn't as great as it should be for the price. My son hates it because he can't turn it, so front heavy. I don't like it because when the sides are removed the end gate doesn't remove so you can't use it without the sides.$LABEL$0
NOT as advertised in picture and NOT worth 50 dollars. One would assume that if you are going to spend fifty dollars on a spice rack, there would be no skimping on quality. The picture and descriptions of this item would have you believe that the spice holders themselves would be stainless steel or some form of at least aluminum. They even add a nice metallic sheen in the picture. In addition, you would think that with fifty dollars they would make the core glass or at least a strong composite. The shakers clear area is a cheap plastic. The stand itself appears durable but the shaker color does not match the stainless steel stand or my other stainless appliances. It actually looks cheap next to them. I would not recommend this product and will likely return this item. Positives include a strong base and magnets that work. I have no other compliments.$LABEL$0
Blast: unavailabilty. I have shared this product, everyone liked it as well as I did. Problem: I can't find it anywhere. What's up with that? I originally found it at Walmart.

A "Must-See" DVD.

A great book for any child. This is a wonderful book for children. My kids suprised me by pulling it off their bookshelf and asking me to read it to them. They are typical American children with no sense of what it must be like to grow up in a different culture. But they loved this book and so did I. It's simply written, so that children from 7-100 can understand it -- and even electronic-age kids can relate to the experience of growing up without a Nintendo DS or a Wii, or even a TV.$LABEL$1
Great product and awesome customer service!. This is my second Casio pocket-size calculator. I loved the first one I bought and that led me to buy this one.

BEST BOOK!. The Outcast of Redwall is one of the best books ever written! It deserves 500 stars! It is about Sunflash the Mace, lord of Salamandastron, Swartt Sixclaw, a weasel, and Swartt's son Veil. It has a very intriguing plot where Sunflash the Mace and Swartt Sixclaw swear to kill each other and Veil is taken in at Redwall when just a baby. He is cast out seasons later for trying to commit a murder as well as many other things. The end is totally unpridictable and very exciting.$LABEL$1
not worth a penny. This is simply a new page for an old product with too many bad reviews. Notice that all the good reviews sound kind of the same.

A Joycean discourse on the tribulations of Black America.. Louis Edwards, in the esteemed tradition of Joyce, Wolff and John Edgar Wideman, delivers a tour de force in his first novel "Ten Seconds". With remarkably swift yet extremely provocative prose, Edwards recounts the life of a young African-American man attempting to ground his identity in the south. Using a Joycean technique, in terms of the cyclical structure of the novel (based on ten seconds of a 100 meter race), Edwards captivates the reader from page one. Once you pick this, you will not put it down until it is over. Wonderful!$LABEL$1
Great Product. product was on time. no damages and worth the Price! from now on i will order my picks only from them.$LABEL$1
Can anyone say over-written?. One of the reviews on here hit it right on the head. Nothing much happens to this guy. As a result, he has to wax poetic on every detail of his life.Police officers have a tough job. So do many others. I'm not sure that rates 500 pages of what is supposed to be soaring prose.And a TERRIBlE idea to release this before the summer. This is the antithesis of a summer read!He's getting by on his Harvard English degree. I didn't get through it all, sorry--ran out of interest.$LABEL$0

Less than zero. Too bad I could not rate this book a zero because it screams for it! To say I was disappointed is a gross understatement. I read the reviews from many readers and really expected a good read but in my opinion this book lacked everything I look for in Vampire Eroticism/Romance. The characters were dead-on one dimensional. There was no definable tension between Domini and Alec, no suspense within the story, and certainly no anticipation leading into the sex which, let's face it, all Vampire addicts crave and expect. And really, what was up with that Indiana Jones hat??? That was a real turn off for me. A Vampire with a fedora? Ick! If you're looking for a sweet ride to the dark side, hit it with J R Ward and her Black Dagger Brotherhood series.$LABEL$0

The complete Don Fury recordings are available in mp3!. The wiki link says that Brian "Zoid" the singer has a nerve problem and can't sing anymore. Who knows if that is even true. The link is in German and the computer translated it after a couple tries. Check out the complete Don Fury sessions on mp3 format at Amazon, only $8.99 . The cd sold out within a week at RevHq.com. The quality of the recording is beyond perfect and what you would expect from the legend, Don Fury. Very famous pioneer in these kinds of arts. This is the heart of the art of it.$LABEL$1
Lasted A Whole 2 Months. I bought this with high hopes. Right out of the box this thing was super loud but I thought maybe it would settle in. Well it did. The noise dropped off after about 3 days.

ViaVoice Mac OS X doesn't work beyond 10.3.5. I recently purchased ViaVoice MAC OS X because I had used the OS 9 version and liked it. When I up-graded to a new G4 Powerbook running OS 10.3.7, I purchased the new version so that it would work with OS X. After installing it and going through the training, I found that I could not use it, because it kept unexpectedly quiting when I tried to launch Speakpad. I called Scansoft and was informed that it only works with 10.3.5 or below. I have searched many descriptions of the product and no mention of this was found. Tech support said that they had been working on it, but saw no new release in the near future. I would not recommend the product if you plan to use an up-to-date operating system. ScanSoft ought to make this clear in their product requierments.$LABEL$0
A great idea for a book, but messed up by authors' poor job. A great idea for a book, but the book is messed up by the authors' silliness and self-indulgence. Had the authors just dealt with their topic, it would be five stars. Instead,the book suffers from two major problems. First, almost every paragraph is replete with childish "inside" jokes, sophomoric asides (invariably Lefist where they are politifal), imbecilic puns and similar self-indulgent stupidity, apparently included to show how clever the authors are. Instead, all this junk just distracts from any discussion and generally leaves the reader grinding his teeth in annoyance. Second, there are serious and repeated errors in the descriptions of the movie plots. Did the authors actually watch all the films discussed, or did they rely on others (grad students, perhaps?) for some of the material? My conclusion is that the topic is well worth a book, and its a shame the authors made such a mess of this one.$LABEL$0
Plain doesn't work.. This is the biggest piece of crap I have ever bought. I am shocked that it says "Belkin" on the label. It plain doesn't work on any of my memory cards.I bought the Belkin Multimedia Reader & Writer Expresscard for my new Macbook Pro, and it works exactly as well as a piece of ham. Well, that's probably not fair. I imagine it ejects from my Expresscard slot cleaner than a piece of ham would; but functionally it is the same as ham.I have tried five different SD cards of various capacities in it, and it failed to read any of them. I am surprised at the poor quality from a Belkin product. After all, this isn't a no-name EBay special freshly shipped from China. It's a BELKIN!$LABEL$0

My favorite gift for parents-to-be. I buy this for friends as soon as I hear that they are expecting their first. There are so many practical things that you just don't know until after you actually have a baby, and then you're stuck with the stroller that takes two hands and a PhD to fold up. This little book is solid consumer advice, and gives the feeling that these decisions are not that impossible after all.$LABEL$1
Right Wing Propaganda. This so called "neutral" video is blatent right-wing propaganda.Proof:It has won the John Birch Society Award for Excellence in Documentary Filmmaking.

The Pilgrim's Progress (complete and unabridged version). UNFAIR you are showing a wonderful book, which I have read and thouroughly enjoyed so I orderd (I thought) another one for my son. I was VERY disappointed when I saw what book had been sent me. It WAS NOT "Pilgrim Progress in todays English" which is the book that I was under the impression I had ordered. The one I received was the 'COMPLETE AND UNABRIDGED EDITION". The one I thought I would be getting is "In todays English". NO WAY can my young adult student begin to understand this language! I was very disappointed, but the cost of returning it would have been more than what I paid for the book in the first place.$LABEL$0

An album of poor quality. This is plainly an album of poor quality. Not only has Russell Watson a course and untrained voice, his performances are non-stylish, unsubtle and unidiomatic.

Great singing marred by abysmal production. Madeleine Grey was one of the great voices of the 20th century. Unfortunately, her early death robbed us of a great artist. What with the superlative computer musical reprocessing techniques - there is no excuse for the horrendous production of this disk.

BE FORWARNED. Remember before you even think of buying this book that there are a few prerequisites before you can even think of getting started. 1.) The required excercises must be done in a gym. 2.) You need 20 minutes 3 days a week, and 45 minutes 3 days a week for the excercises. 3.) The program relies heavily on supplements which happen to be manufactured by the author's former employer. So besides the investment of the book (Which you don't even need because all the info is free on the web site for free), you need a gym membership and a budget for supplements. Be careful if you are a novice dieter or weightlifter--this is not for you.$LABEL$0
You will probably not find this review helpful. Ok, so call me shallow, but I guess I tried to watch this movie a couple years ago, and I found it again the other day on my DVD shelf. I could not figure out how it got there or why I didn't remember much of it. Well, I figured it out pretty quickly. The female lead looks like she forgot to take off ghoul makeup and put on wrinkle cream or any other makeup. I mean seriously she looks so weathered that it pretty much ruins the movie, which otherwise is generally entertaining. I would have preferred looking at a fat lady for 90 minutes to looking at the lines all over her face.$LABEL$0
WORST FILM I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. Really, this is the worst film I've seen in years. I had expected a quality film from Julia Roberts, but this film distorts, changes (for the worst) and ruins the classical Snow White story most of us are familiar with. It's too scary for children, and yet the film was probably made for audiences under 10 years old. Nathan Lane turns in an embarrassing performance, and Julia Roberts' performance is one-dimensional and SO boring. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this movie.$LABEL$0

Goldsmith Borrows A Little from Himself. With a career spanning over four decades, Goldsmith has attained a position as one of the movie's most prolific and innovative composers. Although his work during the past ten years does not compare to his landmark work of the 60's and 70's, he did do two exemplary scores in the 90's: one is the music to "The Ghost in the Darkness" and "Total Recall."What makes "Recall" such a winner is that it seems to pay homage to Goldsmith's earlier triumphs. One can hear "The Omen," "Planet of the Apes," the underrated "Secret of N.I.M.H" and even "Gremlins" in the otherworldly melodies used to complement the film. There is much originality in this composition with the opening and closing themes being especially awesome in their execution. But it is the patented Goldsmith "touches" that make this one significant and a worthy, albeit unintended, "introduction" for those who are just discovering the composer.$LABEL$1
Close but no Ceegar!. This is the second rack purchased from Kingwin and I am disappointed. The tiny fan is way too noisy, and the system is not swappable without turning off the computer, even though it has a key to turn off power and unlock the tray.With external drives in general, all you need to do is either use the Safe remove in the oS or simly unplug the power. The drive stops and the reference in My Computer disappears. But with the Kingwin, using the key to turn off power does not provide this functionality. In fact, if you do so, you must reboot anyway, and it will involve a hard reboot, as the OS is stuck looking for this drive in an endless loop for reboot. You can go ahead and pull the drive, it is shut off, but the icon for it does not disappear from Computer, as does externals do.I'll likely look for a true hot swappable enclosure.Win 7 64 bit, AMD system 12G memory.$LABEL$0

Good Grill, BAD cover. What a ripoff -literally. It rips if you look at it the wrong way. This thin and poorly made grill cover will not enhance the reputation of its manufacturer, CharGriller, a company that makes a respectable grill and smoker at the right price.

I Didn't Understand, So I watched it again. I first watched the movie on PBS. I didn't fully understand who some of the characters were and how they fit into the picture. I bought the movie so that I could watch it again. I now understand what was going on. I know things back then are not the way they are now, except the fact that most of the time money is everything. How did we get from there to here? Some standards have gone down the trash. The ladies and gentlemen all talk so proper. Lizzie is so stubborn. But her mother got to me the most. I found her nagging voice very irritating and the way she could change her opinion of other people so quickly so she does not look stupid to her family and friends. Mr.Darcy is proof that you can change the first impression you give other people. But it also helps you to see that if you never tell anyone how you feel, how will you ever know how they feel. And most of all I did get that warm and tinglely feeling at the end of the movie.$LABEL$1
A Very Good Summary. A little smart-alecky for its own good sometimes, and sometimes drawing some probably unfair conclusions, this book is still the best summary of all the Clinton scandals until 1998. And oh my, were there a lot of meat to those scandals. It's a startling reminder of just how much substantiated fact was involved with the Clinton allegations compared to the allegations that the left just can't seem to make stick on Bush.$LABEL$1

Belkins TuneCast II isn't worth it.. I was looking for an fm tuner to use in my car for going down the highway. i'm not rich and this one was the cheapest i could use with my new Sansa Clip. but only to find out that i GOT cheap. all i got was static when i tried to use it in the car and home sterio. the range (according to Belkin.com) is 10 to 30 ft. with 10 or less being optimal. so i went to their web site and looked up the best options to tune the radio to (like the directions say) only to find that even with the transmitter sitting ON TOP OF the sterio (clearly less than 10 feet away) all i got was static with a very slight hint of music. and the worst thing is i'm not even from a town with heavy fm signals. i tried high, i tried low, and even in the middle of the fm band and got static. ok, yeah, some where better than others but none were even remotely close to being listenable.$LABEL$0
Great Product, Watch Your Seller. I got this item in great shape - no rust etc, X-Acto quality, but - Be careful where you buy this.

Cute-looking, but totally unreliable. Just like another commenter, my 'cute' Canon tortured me by sometimes showing a blinking 'H' after removing a roll a film.

if you need POTS only. We've got a Step 2 kitchen from our friends with TONS of extra stuff, but the two pots (the ones which actually make sounds) were missing.I searched on-line and found that for the set Amazon has the best price, however, if you only need Pot and Frying pan, as we do, go to Step2 replacement parts, they are 3 times cheaper than the whole set. If you got your kitchen from friends or other places, you probably already have plates and spoons, so why spend more on stuff you really don't need.$LABEL$0

Better than I was expecting. I was introduced to Alizee through World of Warcraft. My nephew showed me a video with all of the dances, and Jen ai Marre was the song playing in the background for one of them. I really fell in love with the song, and saw the CD here. I decided to pick it up.Needless to say, I really dig this CD. While there are some perennial favorites for me, the whole thing is really enjoyable.

Not Impressed with the new version.. I've had the older version (11B) for over a year and have never had a problem.

And just this week the built in mic stopped working. All I hear is static. I love the linksys wireless products and have spent a lot of money with them.

Poor Customer Service & A Great Program Ruined. I don't own this version but I have used it and it has deteriorated greatly over the years. Canvas 3.5 was the best and Canvas 5.0 wasn't bad but Canvas 8 had quite a few problems on the mac including a windows type interface and stability problems. After Deneba sold it to ACD, it went down hill fast. Deneba had great customer service and support but ACD was lousy in this area and they raised the price significantly. ACD kept sending me offers to buy the windows version (I have bought 5 different mac versions) when I sent them an email asking about a fourth coming mac version they would not even answer the email.

My two cent. I've had my Slick U212 since about 1988, my first and only tripod. Bought it used from a amateur photo shoot buddy. His thing was the Leica R4, If I remember correctly, while mine was the Olympus OM4 SLR.Haven't used my U212 much since the days of photo shoots. Currently looking around to supplement the U212 with a ball head by Bogen Monfrotto and a binocular adaptor. Lots of searching and thinking with adaptors and bushings because Monfrotto is threaded for 3/8" while the U212 is 1/4".All this tinkering just to find all that is really needed is the binocular adaptor and perhaps some spare quick shoes for the U212. The Slick Universal U212 really is universal.The U212 is not the lightest, strongest, or flexible (head swapping) unit available. If your needs for a tripod are general and non specific the U212 has proven over the years to be exceptional.$LABEL$1

Full of typos, I wonder if anyone really did proofread it.Also, the actual reporting of action doesn't even begin until page 111. The previous 110 pages of drivel are Koopman's life. Trust me, 5 pages would have sufficed.Poorly written, slow, and written a jarring short-sentence style, I will soon be listing it for sale here while it's still in hardback.AVOID!!.$LABEL$0

DO NOT get a self propelled vacume!! Way to heavy!. I had my heart set on a self propell vac because I have a bad back. After 14 months the self propell broke! It is now easier to push my car down the street then push this thing across the livingroom because the self propell unit inside the vacume is so heavy, it really weighs the vacume down. It still sucks great but if I'm going to keep useing it I will have to go back to physical therapy.This thing is such a tank if you run into a pice of furniture it will dent your furniture!Carring it up and down the stairs while trying to vacume is impossible. The self propell unit is so heavy it really defeats the purpose of having one.Hoover is still my favorite vac, just don't get a self propell!$LABEL$0

McCormick Grill Mates Pork Rub. I usually make my own rub as it's simple and as long as your spices are fresh, it can come out exactly as you like it.I tried this product only because there was a considerable savings offered at the grocery store. The flavor is not too hot and not too sweet and pleasant and not overpowering.It contains chili pepper, red pepper, brown sugar, garlic, onion salt and apple cider vinegar which are ingredients I normally wouldn't use, but it did add a great flavor to my pork ribs.I'm happy with this rub and will probably use it again in the future.$LABEL$1
No Surprise........ ...Alice did it again with her 2nd CD! What a voice! There isn't one bad song on the entire CD. However, if I had to pick my favorite - I pick Alice and her piano on "Northern Star" - true honesty and grace as well as strong passion. My other favorites would have to be "Some Things Get Lost" (she has a great voice for ballads) and "Parallel Life". Although it took some getting use to, I do like the new versions of "I Hear You Say" and "I'll Be The One". Hopefully, we'll start hearing it in Columbus soon! Way to go Alice!$LABEL$1
Five stars, for Erin Grey, not Gil Gerard. The price of this DVD set can not be beat. If you are a fan of this series and you want to watch these episodes again, you won't go wrong in getting this.But as I watched the shows, it was Erin Grey who really stood out. After watching a handful I predicted what Buck would do. Gil Gerard must have had a "kick" clause in his contract because that's all this guy did in every episode. Season one of course was much better. There's only thirteen episodes in season two, which meant it was thirteen too many.The guest stars here really stood out and that's why I am glad I own this. Roddy McDowell, Jamie Lee Curtis, Dorothy Stratton, Gary Coleman, Buster Crabb, etc. They were excellent.$LABEL$1

Comfortable Elegance. I absolutely adore this ear cuff; it is sleek and comfy. I haven't felt any pain or irritation while wearing this cuff, it is a bit tricky to put it on and off, but nothing to hinder it. Once on, the cuff stays in place and I have no worries of it might falling off. I also just bought the 6DSS Sterling Silver tiny earwrap as well. Excellent for a first cuff. The little thumb-sized plastic container it came in has already come in hand for keeping my growing collection of ear cuffs! Love it!$LABEL$1
Is this what pop culture is coming to?. Techno, schmecno...who would dare to call this garbage "music?" The lyrics are boring, repetitive, and stupid, and these guys can NOT sing or dance. I believe that this is a group of guys with absolutely ZERO talent attempting to become a boy band. News Flash: we don't want to listen to annoying, mechanical voices! Not to mention their awful music videos...the cheesy computer animation is horrible. "I'm blue, da ba dee da ba..." Puh-leeze! This is a disgrace to the music industry. They should have called this album "Europoop" (I did not make a typo)! If "europop" is what you want, try S Club 7...NOT this garbage!$LABEL$0
Very disappointing. I have owned a hard copy edition of Britannica for over 25 years and it's a masterpiece. I have owned software versions for 6 years, and this year's is without a doubt the worst product of all, and clearly inferior to the contemporaneous Encarta 2002, Worldbook 2002, and even Grolier's 2002. Advertising of content has been confusing and deceitful. Navigation is very poor.$LABEL$0

Ridiculous. Are people comparing this to Oldboy? Oldboy was flabbergasting. It delivers an invisible slap of surprise on the watcher's face. Mr. Vengeance fails miserably at creating any sort of effect whatsoever. The storyline is a bit challenged, if you ask me. There is no real feeling of revenge and most of the time the screenplay with characters coming in and going out creates confusion. It took me a while to understand what's actually going on. I watched this 40 days back and can't even recall what happens in the end. What's even more confusing is that I've known to have a prodigious memory of mind, or atleast I claim to.In any case, absolute bollocks of a movie watching experience. Avoid.$LABEL$0
size information not in online description. I purchased the fannypacks for my 5 and 3 year old grandchildren. Since they are called "kids," I thought that they would be child-size. However, when they arrived I discovered that they are made for adolescents, requiring the belt to be shortened several inches for our family's use. In fact, the tag says "intended for children 8 and over." It would have been helpful if that information had been included in the online description. Having a pouch for a drink bottle is a good feature, and the quality is good. The size is just larger than the online info implies.$LABEL$1
What a waste. This is the first Bowie cd and I'm already disgusted. I bought this thinking I would get complete unedited songs but all this has is severely cut songs and a promo for his website. If you're going to make it pc compatible than at least give us a couple of videos at least. My advice: Skip Bowie altogether. He's a businessman not a musician dedicated to bringing the ultimate in quality to his fans.$LABEL$0
Bravo. I love this DVD! It is recorded at the end of a tour. They are home in Seattle and the band is very tight. They appear to be happy to be home and they put a great show for the home audiance. There personalities really come through on this dvd. Ann and Nancy Wilson prove that they are two of the best female performers on the planet. Ann's voice sounds great on classics like "Alone". Nancy's shows off her guitar playing on songs like "Love Alive". They play all the classics and in the middle of the concert Ann and Namcy do an acoustic set which ends with a great Elton John cover of "Mona Lisa and Mad Hatters". Their vocal harmonies are like ear candy. The whole band sounds great. They have gotten better with age and have work hard to master their craft. Their covers of Led Zepplin are outstanding. They have stood the test of time. I highly recommend this dvd!$LABEL$1
don't bother. Why this item got the reviews it did I'll never understand. My light worked briefly, after fiddling with the switch, then never lit up again.

You may need to be a detective noir fan to enjoy this.. I didn't enjoy reading this book. I think the noir type writing made me feel like I was reading a spoof that was too long.

Great purchase will be better the second time. OK, I'm a white collar guy who just wanted an alternative to jeans to play outside with my kids and then head to the store with my wife without changing. This was a completely blind purchase and these are perfect. Took them to the mountains and rode the sled in the snow and also horseback all day. They did not soak like jeans or get me cold. I live in the desert and can wear them in the warm weather. Very tough and better looking than any jeans. BUT pay heed to the reviews. Put your vanity aside and order an extra inch on the waist; they are tighter and less stretchy than your jeans. My second pair will be even better now that I know that.Cheers.$LABEL$1
A Fusion Classic. This album is Brand X at their best. Many would say that Mahavishnu's Inner Mounting Flame was the quintessential fusion album, but I'd say this one delivers stiff competition. Lumley's flowing melodies soar in front of Goodsall's intricate picked (not strummed) rhythms and Jones' innovative bass lines. If that's not enough, Phil Collins does his best work ever on the drums right here. There's no comparision to his work in Genesis -- who knew the guy could play this well? If you love fusion, you've gotta have this one.$LABEL$1
MPS5280. I found this book in our adoption agency and had to buy it. I like the fact that it's easy to read and that it mentions high level milestones for my son. While I didn't give birth, I think it gives common sense advice to mom's about recovery and the relationship advice is true whether you adopt or give birth. If you are looking for a very detailed book, this is not the one, but for something high level (believe me, I have Dr. Sears book and several other's that I think are way too much to read during the first few months). Not to mention in those books, my son who was born 4 weeks early may or may not fit the timeframe. This book makes it easier to relate to since it's my month and if he doesn't fit the timeframe, it's high level enough to know it's okay if he's not reached that milestone yet. I recommend this book for new parents and as a shower/baby gift.$LABEL$1
New And Fresh beats. This album is great it brings to the plate a set new and fresh group of beats. This is a great CD to espand your study of groove-ology and rythm. I would recomend this CD to anyone who loves new and fresh sounds. EVERYONE should jam this CD loud all the time!!$LABEL$1
Concise, easy to read and riddled with errors.. A good introduction as long as the reader relies on the prose sections, and not the illustations or the study questions.

Speaker Stand work PERFECT, just minor drilling. The speaker Stands are just fine, I see many reviews that people have cracked them. yes the holes for the pre screw insert are a bit small. you could get smaller screws, OR just get a little bigger size drill bit and make the holes bigger. it worked great for me and no cracking or anything. i love them stands. now the only problem I have is that they uped the price to 50 bucks a set!... however.. i guess its still okay with free shipping.$LABEL$1

Hawk Ceramic Performance Pads. Installed this on my 2002 Tacoma, about 1000 miles ago and so far I have been satisfied. I resurfaced the existing brembo OE rotors and popped in the Hawk Ceramic Performance Pads. Followed the bedding process per Hawk instructions and they made considerably more dust than the ATE Ceramic Pads they were replacing. Just during the short bedding process there was a light coat of dust on the rims. They have a noticably better bite than the ATE Ceramics, but an ever so slightly higher noise also. Overall, satisfied with them, but only time or miles will tell.$LABEL$1

A Lovely, Lovely Story. I have just discovered Liz Carlyle and I feel fortunate indeed. I am halway through her second book, "A Woman Scorned" and I can barely tear myself away from it. This is a very gifted author and all her books should be read (I think in the order she has written them). Unfortunately there are only four books right now, but we can only hope that she is as prolific as she is gifted. Her characters are so well drawn out you can actually remember them. Her secondary characters are also rich and vibrant. Her dialogue is wonderful and her prose is unique and highly-charged emotionally whether she is describing a thought or a sensuous love scene. Buy her. Read her. Treasure her. I can't wait to read all of her books.$LABEL$1
Fire Emblem rocks. Fire Emblem is an awsome game. I used an entiere 12 pack of batteries on this game. I have beaten the game 3 times, and find it highly addictive. I put in endless hours at the stadium to level up my army before going into a big match with the Black Fang, and I thought that Nintrndo should release the other Fire Emblem games to the US. Ever since the days of the Super Nintendo, Fire Emblem has been around. the two characters from Super Smash Brothers Melee, they are Fire Emblem People.(Roy and the other one) This is one of the best games of all time.$LABEL$1
new feature. I've been using Petmate water fountains for a few years now, tending to get a couple of years of use out of them. For the price, the amount of use (two cats) and hair I'm usually cleaning out of the pump, it seems reasonable to me. I bought the latest one recently and was pleased to see they've included a screen in front of the pump that is catching a lot of the hair before it gets to the pump.This has a nice water flow, is usually quiet (unless there's a clog or water is pouring out of the resevoir) and the cats have no problem drinking from it. Those are its pros, along with its price (much better than the version that the vet pushes). However, I've noticed that this unit is more difficult to put back together after taking it apart for cleaning, which cost it a star (not sure if it'll get easier over time but am certainly hoping so).$LABEL$1

Works Like It Should. Added this valve to my new shower head and it works well. The package includes an o-ring which I initially installed with the valve. Using teflon tape there was a small leak at that joint, so I removed the valve, took out the o-ring, added a bit more tape and now the joint is leak free. I see no need for the o-ring. Valve does seem to shut off the water completely with my shower head. It is easy to turn and does not seem to reduce the water flow to the shower head.$LABEL$1
So very long and wordy. We selected this book for our December book club discussion. I am only on page 388, and at this point it has become just a chore to pick it up and make my way through it. All about Una all the time, in way way way too many words. For more detail on my one star rating, let me refer you to the review titled: Everyone Loves Una; Or, The Navel-Gazer: A Mary Sue. I couldn't agree more or say it better.$LABEL$0
Works very nice. My school owns two of these and they have worked quite well. We run an NT network and have 2 labs with about 50 computers in each. The computers in the lab print to these, and because we run a network and the printer can two, every classroom and can print to the lab printers. The printer is very versatile with 2 or 3 automatic bays for paper and 2 manual entry paper bays for large papers or envelopes and such. It prints extremely fast, but takes about 5 minutes to warm up in the morning, or 2 minutes to warm up if it hasn't been used in a couple hours. It rarely has problems, and when it does it is usually the kids' fault. It has worked extremely well for our school and has had only a few minor problems.$LABEL$1
Looks cool, bad coffee. Life is just too short to get frustrated by bad coffee every morning. A decent cup (or three) of *strong* coffee is all I require - is this too much to ask? Apparently so for this machine. It looks cool and the carafe feels heavy and high quality, but the coffee is really weak and awful. I have been putting in 2-3 extra scoops of grounds and I still don't like the coffee. Now, I feel like I'm just throwing good money after bad by wasting all that extra coffee grounds. Plus, the warming plate keeps the coffee way too hot and it tastes burned within 15 minutes or so. I figured out why the coffee is so weak - the hot water only sprays out of one little hole onto the grounds - my previous Krups had about 6 little holes to "shower" the coffee grounds. I wish I could return this Braun - I will give it away and buy either another Krups or a Cuisinart.$LABEL$0
Marry Me Gwen Stefani!. I think that at this point in No Doubts career, it was high time for them to produce an disc with all of their singles. My favorite cut on this is the high octane bombast of "New". I love the over processed drums, the 80s style keyboards, and everything about the song. Another highlight is "Hella Good," which is from the rock steady album. Over all, I believe that this is an album thats all about change, as is the band. They have gone from scrappy kids who like Ska, to neo New wavers in 10 years. They have a way of paying homage to their influences, while claiming the styles for their own in a way that no other band is capable of. the only thing that would make it better is if this record was sequenced chronologically, either in correct, or reverse order, so the listener could take the journey with the band, instead of having it scattered around.$LABEL$1
There is better. I thought this book would help me learn Java when I first bought it, but I think the examples are skimpy. A more complete reference and tutorial is Cay Horstman's and Gary Cornell's 7 ed. of Core Java 2: Volumes 1 and 2. These 2 volumes have great examples, and go more in-depth into Java. Skip Schildt's book, and buy the Core Java Volumes even if you need just a reference. You will be happier, and learn more.$LABEL$0

Butz: A Pathological Liar. This author has some nerve trying to rewrite history. Most of my grandmother's family was murdered by the Nazis. To compound this tragedy by denying that 6 million Jews were killed is a further atrocity. The fact that anyone can believe this crap is alarming. The Holocaust DID happen. If you don't believe it, go to any Holocaust memorial (Washington, DC, etc) and see the documentation and photographs for yourself. Also, Yad Vashem (a memorial in Israel) may have a website.

Below average. I bought this laptop a year ago. When it reached, it came with a faulty DVD ROM drive. I had to take DVD ROM out myself and send it back to HP and after they recieved it, they sent me a new DVD ROM which worked well.Couple of months later, the LCD screen won't stay upright and it became loose. So, this time I had to send whole laptop back to HP.I had a tough time with their customer care service. Everytime (5 times) I called them they have tradition of putting me on hold of minimum of 20 mins with breaks of "Sir, Please hold on, I will be with you shortly. I am trying to pull out your record" after every 5 minutesJust yesterday the battery died.I am sure I could have found better laptop had I spent some more time searching.Think twice before buying this.$LABEL$0

Great idea, poor design. This started out as a great little item. I ended up returning it the first time I had to replace the batteries (about 2 months later). Once the old batteries were removed, everything was reset, and I had to reset the time, month, year, and even had to re-calibrate the compass. What a pain, and not worth the money. If I only had to reset the calendar, that would be fine, but having to re-calibrate the compass is a pain.$LABEL$0
great if lasted. I got it about a year 6 month ago. Used it very lightly - 10 times perhaps and the rest of the time it was either in my garage or in my car. When I got it out for a next shoot I noticed that quite a bit of grease leaked out out of head. Good thing it did not ruin anything else, since it was pretty sticky. It still works at the moment, but once grease is gone its days are numbered. This is by far the least amount of use I have ever gotten out of a head.Other than that it is a bit heavy for the specs. I guess this is what you get for not going with a reputable brand... It is amazing how many times I have to relearn this simple fact.$LABEL$0
Disappointed!. This was a painful read. I bought this and Glasshouse together to read while recovering from surgery. Thankfully, I had also purchased some other titles because after forcing myself to finish Accelerando I could not bring myself to even start Glasshouse.I enjoy when an author creates their own vocabulary to express new concepts but Stross takes this practice to an uncomfortable extreme. The number of new concepts being presented along with their associated descriptors was disorienting and hard to follow. Somewhere around the middle of the book, I decided to stop trying to understand the details and just focused on finishing the larger story. I was disappointed again. The End did not justify the means.My opinion: Accelerando as a destination is not worth the journey.$LABEL$0
Just one minor criticism. Archer tells us about Whitechapel at the time of World War I.

Mr. Who or What!. I am so Thankful this film came on Sundance for had it not I would have made the error in buying it for my collection. Really there was what could have been a "real story" here but that did not happend. Instead the director took this film on what seemed to be a if you will "trip". It went here, there, everywhere, leaving you saying what the heck is this so called film I'm watching. Then the so called female friend still doesn't know the difference between a gay man & a straight man with all the gay men she is surrounded by. Please if "anything" rent this film do not buy it. If someone elese were to take and rewrite this script it would be a great story and done without spending a ton of money as well. Simply the director failed at telling any kind of story here. If your bored or a lazy Sunday afternoon take a peak but remember even if it's a lazy afternoon you can not get back the lazy time you gave up by watching this film.Peace & Blesssings,Hope This Helps someone from buying.$LABEL$0

What a piece of ..., As a New Yorker for over 15 years, and an active member of the NYPD, I could only guess that Katz wrote this over simplified fantasy while looking out his hotel room window in-between ordering room service.Anyone who has lived in NYC should immediately recognize how ridiculous, inaccurate and off base this book is.ESU is made up of great men and women who are serious about what they do.

It's not even fun, don't waste your time.$LABEL$0

A Must for any Mountaineer!. This adaptation of John Denver's beloved song is a must for any family who has ties to West Virginia. The illustrations are beautiful and detailed, and the CD is a fun bonus. (Our son likes to have the CD playing as he follows along in the book.)

Great song on a crap album. The rating is for the entire album. I almost gave it one star, but "Crazy" is the catchiest thing I've heard in over a year & deserves much better supporting material than the junk on here. I'm so disappointed...I really wanted to find some hidden gem, but after having it play constantly in my car for the last week, nothing as yet has jumped out of my speakers.It's called inspiration flowed for three minutes & needed some filler to justify a cd length release. A lot of the lyrics for other songs are creepy (but not in any cathartic good way.) And the beats (sans Crazy)are pretty lame too. I borrowed my roommates copy & sure am glad I didn't spend my own 10 bucks.Not many people are able to make an album that's consistently good beginning to end. Who knows why the muse can depart just as quickly as it arrives?$LABEL$0
Highly Recommended. What a great book! All you need to know about your horse's muscles, why you need to stretch and in what situations, is in this book. I have never come across something quite so comprehensive and easy to understand in one book before. It has wonderful big glossy colour pictures, spiral bound for easy page turning as well as being able to keep it open on the page you want while trying out some exercises on your horse.I did several relevant stretch exercises on my horse's sore back end, and within a week he was helping to stretch himself and really seemed to enjoy it, closing his eyes, relaxing and wiggling his lips. His lunging work has also become easier as he has become more supple.I especially recommend this book for anyone doing competition work with their horses, as they can become quite tense in certain areas and this book helps to explain and show you how to release the tension. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1
Basic start reading for the begginer. This book is both a begginer's obligatory reading and a consultation source for the practising lawyer dealing with antitrust issues. It is also quoted in many foreign books about the subject, for example "Os fundamentos do Antitruste" written by a Brazilian professor (Dr. Paula A. Forgioni) also because it is one of the most comprehensive existing/available in the market. In my opinion a book needed in any reasonable office's library. As I have read some parts of it borrowing from a coleague I will by one for myself.$LABEL$1
Constantly changing features on DVDs. Stargate is a great Sci-Fi show, but you probably know that already or you wouldn't be reading a review of Season 3's DVD.I'm a little disappointed that they continue to experiment with the special features on the DVDs. Each disk of Season 2 included the trailers for the shows on that disk. Very nice - we would watch the previews before actually watching the shows. Season 3 does not have that feature - no trailers to be found.As this is a television series that spans many seasons, we were expecting more continuity between each season's DVDs. Not that they would add something, take it away and maybe they will add it back in a later season.Other than that - I would highly recommend the series and the purchase of Season 3.$LABEL$1
UltraVoilet makes for UltraViolence. The movie is great. The blu-ray is sharp and the extras are really neat. So why did I give this item a low rating? The "digital copy" is horrible.

This Book is New York.. This Book is New York. Some say it's the city's foundation. Sure,... it may be on paper, but so what. It's still New York. Take it or leave it. It's just a fact. Some say it's New York dirt. But that's what makes it so worth reading. It shows a side of the city that some New Yorkers may not know or remember. This is why it's worth your time. Similar to certain films being a love story about the city itself (Manhattan (1979), When Harry Met Sally (1989) and You've Got Mail (1998)) this book also goes with other great books about the city, including two recent ones called "Through The Children's Gate" (2006) & "Seven At The Sevens (2012).

Modern Hollywood can't make a 5 star comedy - UNTIL NOW. I thought it couldn't be done. This is not the era of Lloyd, or Fields or Laurel and Hardy. It's not the era of Capra or Preston. 99% of modern comedies suck badly, and or are mean spirited.But miracle of miracles, someone current, finally made an hilarious movie with a heart as big as "You Can't Take it With You!"Credit here goes not to the very good cast but stunningly to the writer/directors: Michael Arndt - Screenwriter, co directed by Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris.Brilliant, and wise. Not just a movie about dysfunctional, it's a movie where looser are shown to be the winners they really are, just for surviving, like all of us. Not a moment of saccharine either. It sharp and intelligent.Beautiful, beautiful movie from beginning to end, and what an ending!$LABEL$1
Great memories. Great memories of Tom Browne's Funkin' for Jamaica and Thighs High (grip yo' hips and move). Just recently purchase this cd and it's as hot as I remember, plus many more nice songs. I would recommend this cd for any jazz-funk fan. Excellent choice to add to collection.$LABEL$1
Pretty but too fragile. Buyer beware! Beautiful to look at but you can't actually USE it! Especially if you have kids. All are chipping. And Pfaltzgraff didn't stand behind this product for us. After a few months we called to complain and ask to exchange for another style, but we were basically told, "Sorry, no exchange. Everybody knows stoneware chips, you should have selected a different material". Um, what? That wasn't on your product description. This junk chips when you put it in the dishwasher and it bumps against another plate! So after barely a year, we will be throwing out a HUGE set that we purchased during a kitchen remodel. (Same review posted for 16-piece set.)$LABEL$0

Big Disappointment. I have read many of Miss Thompson's books and liked most of them. I read this book in the Kindle version, and I don't know what happened to it. The mistakes were so many that I kept asking myself why I kept on reading. Typos, misplaced sentence parts, and flat out wrong words just jump out at me. The story did hold me for a while. But then I had more than a third to go and just got tired of the distruction and human suffering. I don't know the history of this great hurricane, but many of the scenes were unbelievable even in the name of fiction. Sorry, Janice, I had to quit the book before I finished it. I just couldn't stomach anymore.$LABEL$0
Poor quality controll with no Manufacture support. The First Aid [2.0] kit I received was of poor quality. The right seam on hte left inside pocket was only sewn 1/2 way to the bottom. See Pics posted. Needle holes could be seen in the plastic and I called the manufacture who confirmed the pocket should be sewn all the way. I asked them If they would support their product and they would not. This was clearly a manufacturing defect and the Manufacture (or should I say importer) told me they could not help me and to return it to where I bought it from. The case was made overseas with the finest of craftmanship NOT. Hopefully the seller will replace the defective item. Very Poor construction on this Adventure Medical Kit [2.0] and no Manufacture support. This will be the last Adventure Med Kit I buy or Recommend.$LABEL$0
a dissenting opinion. The concept behind this book is interesting but it's art work holds no appeal for my niece. For example, O's representative of an olive is not a beautiful green mediterranean olive but a gray olive that looks more like a rock with a red center. T is a dry looking piece of toast. I like the unconventional choices just not the artwork.$LABEL$0
Solid Entertainment. I saw bad reviews for this movie, and those reviews made me want to see "The Bourne Legacy" because they were along the lines of, "It's too slow, too much character development." And that's exactly what I want in a movie like this! Jeremy Renner is excellent as the lead character, and ably supported by the wonderful Rachel Weisz. Then you throw Ed Norton in the mix and you have a riveting and intriguing action/spy/thriller that raises a lot of question about boundaries, both political and philosophical, and leaves you longing for more.It's very much a Bourne movie, but with better camera work (yes, the last two Matt Damon ones left me a little nauseous from the "realistic" camera shake). Thoroughly recommended, and waiting for the follow-up.$LABEL$1
It's OK, not great. It's very tough to find a decent soaker hose, at any cost. Swan is downright terrible and the company doesn't respond. This hose worked well for a couple of years before splitting on the sides. It's not used everyday. Maybe only 10 times a month during the summer and only at night for about an hour each time. The top side of the hose is very difficult to find and can only be set out during the day. The hose is very light and tends to keep twisting. Can take an hour to set up correctly. Still,it's the best I've found.$LABEL$0
Whisk works just as well. I received the Smoothie Jr. as a gift and was so excited. After unpacking the machine I realized I was missing the stir stick. Back to Basics was wonderful!!! They sent one to me free of charge. I was ready to make great milkshakes and smoothies. My first attempt flopped. I tried a simple milkshake, but it would not mix up, let alone dispense from the dispenser. I kept adding milk to make it thinner, but it never would work.I thought, maybe it's my fault, let's try again. I tried using a banana, strawberry yogurt, orange marmalade, 1/2 cup crushed ice and used over a cup of milk. The machine wouldn't even chop the banana, let alone finish off the ice. I am very frustrated with the machine, and hate to tell the person who gave it to me.Good Luck with yours should you decide to purchase. You may want to try the Elite, it could be stronger.$LABEL$0

HORRIBLE, DOES NOT REPRESENT VIEW OF MOST CHRISTIANS. Horrified is the key word here. I am horrified at Andrews' views so much that this is the first book for which I am writing a review. I am a born again Christian, I know my bible and love the Lord but and am sickened by Christians who take this viewpoint, and sad to think that other people think this is how Christians operate. Andrews' advice to a friend about his daughter, and the description of him and a male teacher "FORCING" a 6th grade boy to submit to corporal punishment 2 or 3 times in a row, then each time forcing the boy to put his arms around Andrews' neck to hug him back, is SICK. MY ADVICE IS - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. I cringe at Christians like this, and feel very sorry for their families and the people who are influenced by or affected by their viewpoints. The only reason I gave this book one star is because I couldn't give it zero or minus stars. Andrews made a few good points but there have to be better books out there.$LABEL$0
A thick thinker, intriguing. This is a very interesting book, but people looking for an easy read with simply-constructed theses should look elsewhere. Pinchbeck approaches his writing as serious science and the text is thick with philosophy, psychology and more.The theories advanced by Pinchbeck are mostly collected theories of others who came before him, enhanced by his own experiences with psychodelics. Some of it will be scoffed at by people who have made up their minds about the way things are and Pinchbeck both acknowledges this and expects it.Early in the book, he turns these people on their heads and sweeps them aside, inviting the curious and those readers with a will to think about things beyond the way they have been explained, beyond the way we are most comfortable with, to read on.Do I buy what Pinchbeck is selling? Some of it, sure. Some of it seems a stretch, but some of it is intriguing. Don't buy this book looking for alternative answers, buy it if you're looking for a thinker.$LABEL$1
I just have to say my piece. Tried this game on my two machines: Duron-1200, 256MB, GF3-64MB, Win98SE -and- a laptop P4-2667, 512MB, ATI9000-64MB, Win98SE.I managed to play at most about 5 minutes then it took down both my PCs. Game didn't work on both campaign and multiplayer modes.After many attempts, reboots, even reinstalls, I gave up, and already uninstalled the game.Although, I'm thinking of trying it on my third PC: P3-550, 256MB, GF3-64MB, Win98SE... nah...$LABEL$0
Don't Bother. I really wanted to like this book; the plot sounded interesting, and it started off okay, but the more I read it, the worse it got. The plot became highly predictable, the writing is atrocious, and the ending punchless. Mr. Dirgo is obviously a Clive Cussler wannabe, but has neither the imagination or story-telling ability (not to mention basic grasp of the English language) to even be mentioned in the same breath as Cussler. To make it to the plodding end of this book requires a lot of patience and a high tolerance for baseless dialogue.$LABEL$0
disappointing series. I have read all 4 books in this series and I would not recommend them to anyone. I am 36 yrs old and this series is for the young adult crowd so maybe I am too old to enjoy it. I found the main character Bella so annoying I had a hard time reading the books. The story took a strange direction in the last book (I thought way too out there for teens). I read the books because I saw a preview for the Twilight movie which I hope is not as bad as the books. I recommend checking them out from your local library before you waste your money. Just a side note- this is the only time I have ever written a review about books or anything, that is how bad I thought the books were.$LABEL$0
Great idea, bad product.. Do not buy this sink. I bought this sink for the room it provides. It is large and deep and I can wash almost anything easily in it. Within months though, the bottom looked terrible despite our efforts to follow all maker recommendations for care. Within a year the white finish was completely worn away in places leaving black areas showing through. The best I have gotten from American Standard is that they will give me $100 credit toward another of their sinks.$LABEL$0
Is this a book or a video game???. This was great the first time I read....er..played it...NOT! If you can't get enough of reading the paper, books, newspapers then now you can also READ a video game. That's right. Read instead of play. The graphics are TERRIBLE. If I wanted old school graphics I'd buy an old school game. Oh and if I wanted to read I'd buy a periodical not a game.$LABEL$0
The illustrated Mary. Very illustrated featuring mainly Mary's imprisionment. This book focuses on many specific parts of her life, hands...eyes...handywork ect. It shows many portraits I have never seen before. Including one of Mary and Darney together. I had forgotten that Mary wore wigs later in life, "When the executioner held up the royal head on the scaffold he found himself holding the Queen's wig while her head fell onto the boards beneath." If this dosen't conjure up an image I don't know what will.$LABEL$0

Beautiful. What the heck is wrong with North American radio? I know...it's a rhetorical question but one that needs to be asked. Especially when it ignores wonderful albums like H.M.S. Fable. This is dense, fluid, passionate music rich in melodies, potent in vocals and song-writing. And, it's by yet another ignored Britpop band. There seems to be no stomach for bands like this one, Shed Seven, Cast, etc. in Canada and the U.S. And, it takes a huge label push to make Travis a "hit" here as well. More fool us. This is yet another album I recommend to people who think rock is dead. No way, No how. Michael Head is a superb writer and performer and the group scores on each of the album's 12 cuts. Check out "Comedy" in particular. It'll remind you of The Beatles, The Byrds, The Moody Blues and more sixties acts. Yet it has a bold, modern sound that hooks the listener in effortlessly and wonderfully. Superb music-making.$LABEL$1

I enjoyed this movie. I will not compare this to Gone with the wind, as that would be unfair. I think the story was predictable in places, but some of the supporting cast was superb. Nicole Kidman did a good job, and Jude Law LOOKED GREAT! :)Anyway, the movie was entertaining and I enjoyed it. The movie sountrack is really good. If you like bluegrass music, you should definitely purchase the soundtrack.$LABEL$1

DO NOT BUY THIS MICROSCOPIC BOOK. I already have the original CubeBook for The Earth and it is truly wonderful. Today I received my order of 3 CubeBooks to give as holiday gifts. Sadly, these were designed for creatures from another world. They are tiny and not worth even looking at. Amazon has the dimensions stated wrong. They are indeed 2.5" cubed. The binding breaks as soon as you open them. Whoever decided that this "mini" CubeBook would be a great idea must have been on some weird, mind(IQ)-altering drugs. I'm sending them back immediately. They are useless. The original version is wonderful though. I'd give this tiny version zero stars if I could.$LABEL$0
Warning!!! This book will damage you and your family from healing!!. As a psychotherapist, I assure you that reparative therapy is not only an ineffective and unethical practice, but also damaging to the soul and self of your loved one. Acceptance is what you and your family needs. The American Psychological Association has deemed reparative therapy unethical practice, and the author of this book, provided he is utilizing this therapy with clients, could and should lose his license to practice. There are many other books available on Amazon.com that can help (What the Bible Really Says About HomosexualityorPositively Gay: New Approaches to Gay and Lesbian Life), but this is not one of them!$LABEL$0

Loved It Until It Died!. After two months of use, one day the computer stopped recognizing the drive. I called Seagate, spent an hour on the phone troubleshooting with them only to learn that the drive is basically dead. My company's IT dept. confirmed this.When I called warranty service, Seagate said the warranty had expired. I told them the drive was only a few months and there is a one-year warranty so how could the warranty have expired? Very frustrating so now I have to send all kinds of proof for a product that was a gift, pretty challenging. Also their service center is in India so you get occassional bad phone connections and some difficulty communicating.More than anything, the massive loss of data is really, really bad. I got a quote from them to recover the data: $1,400. I don't have that kind of money to get my data back.Buyer Beware.$LABEL$0
works great, ignore the previous reviewer. You do not need to use the included software to edit your videos, only to capture and convert them. Once captured, you can use Adobe Premiere or the editing program of your choice.Also, the included Ulead and Main Actor editing software is used by many and far from freebie 'junk.' Why slam Dazzle for including this extra where others wouldn't have bothered? For most people it is more than enough, and saves the cost of additional apps.$LABEL$1

It Could Have Been Better. Shirley Bassey was voted the best female vocalist in the last 50 years, and most of her recordings reflect that. However, this CD is the exception. I don't know if she was just having a bad day, but every song seems to be a struggle for her, and knowing Bassey, there was no reason to struggle! The only song on this CD that she manages to give the "Bassey treatment" to is "As If We Never Said Goodbye", and even it could have been better. The rest are hard to listen to. I love the picture on the cover though.$LABEL$0
INTELLIGENT, BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. I must admit I am not a techno/trance fan, but a friend of mine made me listen to this album and I was awe-struck. Stryke has done what many other d.j.'s don't seem to do in my opinion, that is he puts heart into it. This album will wrap you up and carry you away. I strongly recomend this c.d. not just to ravers and d.j.'s, but to any music lover with an open mind.$LABEL$1
About as Compelling as Me Finishing This Title. I managed to find out that this book wasn't expensive or even rare, as it seems to be. It's just obscure and negligent, and for once, I wish it would be kept that way. The sum of this hundred page book is: inconclusive. It's a theory based on looking at a few flags and thinking to yourself "Hey, these are similar." One of the ideas used to support the theory in this book is the lack of evidence in the formation of Switzerland, and then the large omission of time between that and the Swiss bankers infamous today. There is little concrete historical reality beyond a few fantasmic imaginations and a lack of true Templar scholarship. While I like to believe that some Templars survived the Inquisition, and God knows they did, there is no way, simply no way that a lack of evidence refutes and/or supports evidence.$LABEL$0
Potionless Potion. Like other users have said, this product had zero effect on me. I have pretty bad anxiety and take an SSRI every day, and have Xanax on hand for as-needed use, so perhaps it's just not strong enough for me, but taking it was no different than drinking gross water.$LABEL$0
Sub Par Silverberg, only for die-hard fans of Silverberg. I love Silverberg, he's become my favorite sci fi author by far. With that said, this book is as close to garbage Silverberg will get. What a slog just to get through it. The book should have been edited to less than 100 pages because nothing really ever happens, a whiny, flawed, racist, ex-king/future king recants old stories from his youth amidst a swirling future backdrop that is poorly built except for small snatches. Only a few worlds and technologies and cultural ideas get elaborated upon. And I found the ghosting done only by gypsies into the past and present and future to be fairly stupid and ill-conceived. Some parts were interesting but most of time I found myself saying...I think I care, I think I care, I think I care, I think I don't.$LABEL$0

Valuable Discernment Tool. I had already read a number of more academic books about spiritual direction when I discovered Fleetwood Range's down-to-earth approach to the topic. Her wealth of experience as a spiritual director, along with her understanding of the ambivalence with which many individuals are called to this ministry, makes her book a valuable tool for discernment. By the time I finished reading it, I was able to say without hesitation, "Yes, spiritual direction is indeed where God is calling me to serve." I highly recommend her book to anyone drawn to this topic.$LABEL$1

Why not just be truthful about the product in the description.. The listing stated that this item was an 'Official Nintendo Wii' charger. The charger they sent is clearly not. It's half the weight and quality of an original.I don't mind if an item is not an official item, but list it so. Blatant lies in a listing needs to be addressed by Amazon.When contacting the seller multiple times, you get absolutely no response, so I had to open a case against them. Lets see how that goes.$LABEL$0
The best word to describe this product: "Lame". I bought this as an advertized package with Elenco AmeriKit Learn to Solder Kit. I saw a review on there talking about how they wished it had a "Desoldering pump" My solder-friendly friends told me they had never heard of a "Desoldering Pump". This is likely why-a product this poor is not worth notoriety. The pump is incredibly weak, and works about 1 in 10 attempts. The only way to get enough suction to pick up the melted solder was to hit the release button, which would then kick-back, suck up some of the solder, and then smush the rest onto the pad. I recommend just using the sponge supplied in the learn to solder kit.$LABEL$0

Potboiler, moves along but very unlikely. This is a historical naval book with a lead character much like Alistair MacLean heroes - obstinate, insubordinate, convinced he's smarter than anyone else, declamatory, and full of action. The novelist has his character speaking in little cliches to himself - in for a penny in for a pound Halfhyde! The action progresses well and the historical setting, as far as I can tell, is accurate. Battle sequences are stirring, but all in all .... The entire finish of the book hangs on a monstrous coincidence between nature starting her battle at the same time that the Japanese fire their guns. Unbelievable, and a bit too coy, also bad geology.$LABEL$0

Definitive versions. Maazel does the best Beethoven, and he did it best when he was with the Cleveland Orchestra. These are my definitive versions of the 9th and 5th, with the 9th being particularly sublime. Every single movement he (and the singers) just nail. Perfect sound quality, wonderful recording. You can often find the individuals symphonies on single CDs, but it's nice to have them all together. The included Overtures (Egmont and Fidelio) are just OK, not my favorites by a long shot, but decent enough for a free-be. If you just need to have the nine symphonies on CD and don't want to spread them out over different conductors / orchestras, you could do a lot worse than this.$LABEL$1

You're kidding, right?. I found a copy of "The Iron Tower" in a shoebox of books I bought at a yard sale recently. I read the back cover and was greeted with the line, "Dennis L. McKiernan's Mithgar books are among the most beloved in all of fantasy fiction." Well this book is a must read then, right? Right??Don't believe everything you read.I struggled about a third of the way into the 600 page novel before I realized this was one of the worst fantasy novels I had ever read. Never mind the derivative story; the novel itself is badly written. One of the most glaring problems is the excessive use of passive voice. While it is not techincally wrong, it comes off as amateur and hackneyed. Also, any time an author uses "lo!" in the course of his writing, and is attempting a serious tone, I cringe. I cringed a lot while reading this.$LABEL$0

The trailer is misleading. What you seen in the trailer is basically the first several minutes of the movie.

No one like them. Ever since my dad first bought their tapes in the mid- 90's, I've been listening and loving the harmony of The Winanas. I think I know every song because every song is different and you can't help but join in when they sing. The ballads, gospel that is, are so moving and the duets with Vanessa Bell and Anita Baker are wonderful. if you have never heard these men sing, you're missing something so melodious and mind blowing. I'm telling you if a kid at the age of 10 can fall in love them, then you can too. I love The Winans Music!$LABEL$1
I have to admit that. I am a fool for once more being lured to buying a Scarpetta book. Why does Cornwell insist on writing about her? There is no more inspiration, there is no more life, there is no more hope and there is no more redemption for that once-wonderful-now-a-caricature lady. Some claim here that Cornwell returned to her former form. Don't make me laugh! She had lost everything in fiction world five years ago and she reached the zenith of silliness when she published Isle of Dogs. Now she is trying to do the same thing with the Scarpetta series, making herself a pity caricature of a once-respected author. No more Cornwell for me: Neither from the bookseller nor from the library. If you are wise enough, you will do the same. Let her stop feeding these silly things into us under the name of "novel"$LABEL$0

Shame on Disney for Ruining P.L. Travers' Books!. P.L. Travers rightfully objected to the way Disney's team ruined Mary Poppins' character. It was bad enough to turn it into a musical--the "real" Mary Poppins never sang--but adding cartoons?? Anyone of any age who has read the books **before** seeing the movie has found this very sappy, saccharine movie very hard to digest. I know I did when I was about 8 or 9 years old.

Impressive!. How is it that the Star Trek series can spend $2 million an episode, and only come up with a halfway decent script about 10% of the time? Meanwhile, writers like Ken Wharton, working all alone, can come up with a fast, action-filled, provocative book like this one, and do it for probably less than a $10,000 advance. I don't particularly like "hard" science fiction, and I am sooo bored with authors pontificating about God, the universe, and everything. But Wharton has some genuinely fresh ideas, they're clearly written, and he's got a sizzling story to boot. I only gave it 4 stars (because I'm against grade-inflation!), but it's one of the best books I've read this year!$LABEL$1

Beautiful book. If I could have only one book of "A Christmas Carol" this is the one that I would want. The illustrations are beautiful. The price was terrific. I liked mine so much that I ordered one for a friend. Love it.$LABEL$1
Excellent from cover to cover!. I loved this book, it gave me chills. Robinson's writing is so great that at times I could feel as if I was there and forgot I was reading. Highly recommend The Didymus Contingency!Trust me you too will feel as if you have been taken back in time, and you might not want to leave...$LABEL$1
Missing Pages. This book is great except for the fact that pages are missing!! Apparently this is not uncommon from this publisher. Check that you have all the pages when you receive the book, so you dont get screwed by Amazon's return policy if you don't happen to read the darn thing front to back in the first 30 days...$LABEL$0
I thought "The Bodyguard" was the worst until I heard this... This soundtrack is even worse than "The Bodyguard". Both are schmaltzy, overblown portrayals of unrealistic love. "My Heart WIll Go On" is the equivalent of "I Will Always Love You"--loud, laborous, over-played but with no feeling. Crap$LABEL$0
Boring and repetetive. I found the second season rather boring and repetitive. There are no new ideas. My wife and I stopped watching after the third disk.$LABEL$0
Sorry, But I like Her Earlier Works!. I read the first 50-60 pages and gave up. I am glad that I got this book from the library.I found it to be too convoluted, and could not find a character that I enjoyed enough to try and get through the rest of this book. I am still not clear on the cross dresser double personality thing.I love Jennifer Cruise, and have read all of her books, but I really like her earlier ones. It seems like the last couple I have read just don't quite measure up to those. She seems to be trying to top herself, and to my mind, getting so far out there that her books are no longer quite so enjoyable. I generally consider this genre to be "lighter" reading. Something to enjoy while I relax after work.In this book I could not even keep track of the characters. I just could not get into it. If you are a fan of Welcom to Temptation, Tell Me Lies, and Crazy for You, I do not think that you will enjoy this book.$LABEL$0
DO NOT BUY THIS!. My scanner never worked. The software cannot find the scanner(or the connection.) I studied all the documentation and downloaded the fix program from hp's website, but it still doesn't work.(It was good that they have a "fix" program on their web site to fix this problem, but is it means that they know this product is not perfect?) The so called warrantee for the 3200 model is not protect me at all. No email support. Phone support cost me $2.5/Min by calling a 900 number. To get it repaired, you have to CALL the tech support($2.5/min) to convience them it was the hardware probelm(their problems), not other problems(my problems).... I gave up. and I will never buy any hp product any more.$LABEL$0
works well. After returning a Virgin model of the same type of radio, I was wondering if I'd ever find one that worked! Well, this one does...the battery has lasted over 3 weeks, the reception is decent, and it's so lightweight that you do forget you're wearing it. I recommend this Sony, if you are looking for a simple way to listen to music while you are at the gym, beach, etc...$LABEL$1
Sound of Thunder. This is one of the worst movie I have ever seen. Its special effects are poor and it is hard to understand what is happening. A lot of the film is totally dark and it is almost impossible to know what is going on. And the dinosaurs were terrible this is a real picture movie, and the use creatures look totally unrealistic and creatures that never existed. And its special effects would have been outdated 10 years ago. I hated this movie.$LABEL$0

Very disappointed. I bought this Stanley 20 oz. Thermos/Food Jar for my husband. We live in a very cold climate and he welcomes something hot for lunch when his job is such that he works outside all the time no matter what the weather. This Stanley has not worked. He says it does not keep the food hot. For the price I paid, I would have expected a better product. I had purchased one a few years back and it seemed to work for a few years. Needless to say, I am disappointed in wasting money.$LABEL$0
Gods green Earth. What on Gods green Earth would have R.J. approve of such horrible art work? I am not convinced in the least, that the artist/s even read the WoT series. To qualify myself, I am an avid fan of RJ's work and have read the entire series 4 times now, I am sure I now know what the characters are supposed to look like. Within the covers of this illustrated guide, is perhaps the worst depiction of character resemblance I have ever SEEN!!! It turns my stomach. As an example, Lanfear is described in the series repeatedly as possibly one of the most beautiful women ever... In the Guide, she looks like a pigs behind!! Due to the poor quality of the art, I find it very difficult to even read the contents. I guess I will just have to keep waiting for Path of Daggers!! If you want to see excellant drawings based on the the Wheel of Time series, I suggest checking out the work of Richard Boye and/or Dragonluv on the web... at least they read the series. -Kinslayer$LABEL$0
jack. I have a 42"panasonic plasma that I decided to hang on a wall. After shopping around and educating myself with various choices I decided on the Sanus vmpl50b. Amazonas usual had a great price and I had the mount the same week on regular FREE shipping. The product is easy to install and is of excellent quality. Very heavy gauge steel.My set is about 40lbs. so it easily holds my T.V. and much more. A word of caution for Panasonic users. This mount allegedly holds up to a 56"set but my 42" just fit withnothing to spare. That is because the Panasonic mounting screws are very wide spread only a few inches from the sides. The mounting bar is only 29" long so be careful.But if your set fits it's a great wall mount.$LABEL$1
Very Short and Very Specialized. In my opinion, this is probably most suited for the most severe cases, but the book is short and cheap.$LABEL$0
fragile. I bought this 5x5 for my fiance. He was a bit frustrated since he wanted 3x3. Well you will definately find 5x5 more difficult and I guess my fiance didn't like such a challenge. However it's a good challenge and he'll try to solve it after I get a 3x3 one first. :) He found 5x5 very fragile. You just have to get used to it. Otherwise, it's a nice thing to have and entertain your guests. :)$LABEL$1

This "Ghostbusters" is still a cheap knock off. I remember seeing one episode of this as a little girl, and being confused and disappointed that it was not a continuation of the awesome movie starring Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd.I could not understand why there were two ghostbuster cartoons that looked so different, both in character, content and plot quality.Now, at least I understand why the original franchise relabeled themselves "The Real Ghostbusters" to avoid any confusion with this wretched series. The cartoony ghosts and ghostbusting gorila do absolutely nothing for the plot. I honestly cannot see how this series was made considering the original one was the big money and merchandise maker.Even after all of these years, the series is still a waste of time for people expecting to see something like the movie. Save yourselves time and money and just look for the other series.$LABEL$0
Available, though not on Amazon. i Googled this, and found it on another site:[...].I never got to see "Tonka" on tv or screen, as a kid all i had was a book of it. but i too was taken by the story, and it has remained an interest since then, perhaps sparking my lifelong interest in American Indian history and heritage. Also, not far from where we live here in Kansas, is the museum in Lawrence where the (badly) stuffed remains of Comanche are on exhibit. I always found it rather funny that he is positioned in his glass case with hindquarters facing the room, as though he wants to protect the many NA greats pictured in the case he faces.$LABEL$1
A Trip Down Memory Lane. I remember when I was very little (can't believe I actually remember it that far), my parents bought me this album on cassette. It reminds me of both times my family and I went to Walt Disney World. I lost the cassette tape years ago, and I was surprised to find this album on CD, so I had to order it. The renditions of classic Disney songs are fantastic. Olivia Newton-John's rendition of "Part of Your World" is just beautiful. The Disney Big Band medley of "The Mickey Mouse Club" and "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" reminds me of my recent trip to WDW. And, "Remember the Magic" as sung by Brian McKnight always brings joyful tears to my eye. Highly recommended by me to any Disney fan out there. It's well worth the money. Now I have something relaxing to listen to while doing homework in my small college dorm room.$LABEL$1

Great Ring!. This ring is beautiful. I've had it for about a month now and it still shines! There is a very small gap between the rings, but I don't see what the problem with that is (it is two rings after all)! Everyone that I have shown it to cannot tell that it is not real. There is some wear on the side of the ring that rubs the other but its on the inside where you don't see it. I use it as my wedding set and wear it everyday with no discoloration and wash my hands with it on with no problems. This is a beautiful ring and I would highly recommend it :)$LABEL$1
Chilling and awakening.. This excellently researched and lucidly written dissection of the development and activities of the Psychiatric establishment was immediately a favorite. If Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward met Stephen King and pursued the trail of madness and subsidized chaos they could not have surpassed Mr. Wiseman's straightforward and gripping exposition of the development of influence and and power by the Psyciatric elite. Here he lays out clearly the methods in creating madness, subsidy and more madness. I cannot recommend this highly enough as an enjoyable and enlightening addition to the aware and concerned person's library.$LABEL$1
has quality but no plot. I am not sure why I saw this movie, its not usually the kind of movie I like. I probably just was in a bad mood and wanted to see loads of pale people in dark clothes, blood, full moon and rainy streets. So far, so good. It is a well made story, though I am not sure what the story is. It is entertaining and it makes some effort with creating an appropriate atmosphere including the way it is told by a narrator. The movie has some highlights (I esp. like the scene where half of his head slips off) but it lacks from the absence of a "hero(ine)" or whatever central character to identify with. It would make a good pc-game without much alteration.$LABEL$1
Standing Next to History. This book gave some very interesting and revealing insight into the Secret Services' job of providing protection to the highest officers of our government. After some rocky beginnings when holders of high office were either killed or wounded or suffered some close calls from those who want to kill this nation's leaders the Secret Service is doing much better. It would provide a fine career for young, intelligent, dedicated persons.$LABEL$1
Yuck!. I expected a dark, terse, exciting horror film. Instead, I got this. Now, no offense to the people who made it, but this was the most disappointing film since...(twenty seconds later)...since...Anyhow, I didn't like it. It didn't scary me at all (okay, the scene with Noah, Samara, and the TV was a LITTLE bit creepy). Actually, I thought it was more comedy than horror, such as the scene my friends and I have dubbed "The Suicidal Demon Horse Scene!" (I cracked up when I saw that, not that there's anything funny horses die).And another thing! People in horror movie's are SO STUPID. It really ticks me off. I was near the end of the movie, and Rachel (was that her name?) was trapped in the well, and she finds (spoilers) and I'm like "WHY THE HECK DID YOU WATCH THAT STUPID TAPE IN THE FIRST PLACE!?"There were really two things I liked. The premise (inspired idea) and the scene where we see the video. That was my favorite scene, hands down. Wait, no... Suicidal Demon Horse!!Is "Ringu" better?$LABEL$0
Beautiful..absolutly breath-taking. Never has there been a tale quite so epic, so emotional, and thought provoking. Dante, has done what no one else has dared to do, take us on a guided tour of hell, purgatory, and paradise. He makes you believe and fear the real thing. This story will stand for another 700 years as one of the single most important literary works of all time.$LABEL$1
stay away from it. this book is not even good for the beginners. it dumps the code without any good explanation. there are also many errors which will cause the beginners endless pains when they try to test the examples. to the author: please write something you REALLY know, and practice on daily basis.

Should be titled Statistics While Yawning. I had to read this book for a statistics class I'm taking and it was the most painful experience I've ever had while reading a book. Most of the time it felt like I was reading, "blah blah blah blah blah." No there weren't tears, but I was definitely yawning throughout the whole thing. In fact, I woke up in the middle of the night recently and couldn't get back to sleep so I picked up this book and started reading. It worked great in helping me get back to sleep. This book is NOT for the average, normal person. It's pretty much for Derek Rowntree alone. He's the only one who would really find the things he's written of interest. He makes statistics a bore and I normally love math. DON'T get this book and if you're a professor/instructor PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE don't make your students read it. Unless of course you pride yourself on being the most hated professor...in which case assigning this book should do the trick!$LABEL$0
Great Buy. These were a nice set of knives and quite sharp. We were quite impressed by the quality for the price. These items should all be hand-washed since the dishwasher can dull the edges very quickly.The knives are stainless steel in color, and come in a nice black block. The weight of the knives were decent (not too heavy, nor too light). It makes a wonderful addition to every kitchen.$LABEL$1
An Entertaining Legal Thriller. This is the second in the 'Chambers of Justice' series by Craig Parshall. As with the first one, this is well done.The plot centers around the child welfare authorities trying to remove parental custody based on an allegation of terrible child abuse. There are many twists and turns throughout. The courtroom drama is great as is the rest.In addition to being a legal thriller, this book explores many spiritual issues. The lead character, Will Chambers is a fledgling Christian who is working on his spiritual life in addition to the action in the main storyline. That part is well done also.I will certainly be checking out more books in this series. I recommend this book, but readers should probably start with 'The Resurrection File', which is the first one in this collection.$LABEL$1

Throwing pearls before geeks. This DVD presents and incomparable collection of historic dance clips. But whoever is behind Dancetime Publications hasn't got a clue about handling historical material. They ripped out the original soundtracks and replaced them with a ragtime piano track that has nothing to do with either the rhythm of the dancers or the music of the periods. Get this DVD --- because I know of no other source to see these dance clips --- but be prepared to turn the sound off, and wonder how anyone could have blown it this bad in their concept of historical preservation.$LABEL$0

Hackman's Great. Gene Hackman is not handsome or suave. He isn't a tough guy in the mold of Bogart or Cagney though he has a manly presence. He doesn't have a romantic persona on screen, but somehow he carries off a believable middle-age romance with Ann Margret in Twice in a Lifetime. Well, who wouldn't if the object of affection was Ann-Margret?When a man leaves his family after fifty, dumps his wife, lovely Ellen Burstyn, and separates himself from his angry daughter, Amy Madigan of the short hair do and Ally Sheedy of the Brat Pack fame, well, all hell breaks lose. If blue collar, Mariner and Sea Hawk rooting, Harry MacKenzie wants a second chance at love, he has to face the wrath of all those that love him.This is an uncharacteristic look at middle-age divorce and love so rare in a Hollywood film. Harry has wrought a moral and ethical riddle. The audience will have to decide.$LABEL$1
Simple and very functional. We were looking for a desk for our son's room. This one was the right size and I expect will be able to grow with him through the school years. One slight disappointment we had was the cover for the keyboard tray is attached to the desk and not the tray as some are. This limits the use of the tray as a drawer which we had intended since the son in question is not yet old enough for a computer.That said, this is still a good desk for the money.$LABEL$1
Not for everyone.. This a great tool if you work on cars. But it tends to over read the OBD1 cars. You have to learn how to use it,it's more than just plug it in and read it. When you use it on OBD1 one problem can cause more than one code to show, that doesn't mean you have more than one problem even though it looks that way. I still like this reader, but it's not for everybody. Great price on Amazon.$LABEL$1
Gabby Reece's book Rocks!. I loved reading BIg Girl in the Middle! I was amazed to find that Gabrielle Reece was more fascinating than I thought she'd be. The girl is witty, beautiful, and she has some pretty deep thoughts on a lot of things-and a great deal of insight to back it all up! I think she should seriously be considered as a good example of a role model for girls, and some people out there would probably be better off if they acted more like her!$LABEL$1

No good. I bought this EH40 on July 2012 for my water heater. It's easy to install and program, just read the instructions. When I was done programing it, and let it do its work I noticed 3 hours later the time was off and the timer programs I had put in where erased. Because it has an AA batery, I installed a brand new one hoping this solved the problem.Programed the timer again and the next day the same thing. The time was off and could not access the programing area beacuse it seemed frozen. I reseted, and placed it on manual and turned the heater on for 3 days and did not disconfigurate. After those 3 days, i programed the timer again and the same thing happend, lost all configuration. I called Intermatic and they were of no help. Started reading online for ways to solve the issue and some people say it's electric noise that scrambles the information. Some say that's not right and just stay away from this product.So now I have a $70.00 on-off manual water heater switch.$LABEL$0
Double Duty Product: Best for Removing Long Last Lip Color. I use these pads every day for effortless removal of long lasting lip color such as Cover Girl Outlast, Revlon Colorstay Overtime and Max Factor Lipfinity. The pads are very thin and are saturated with an oil-based liquid.They are also good for removing waterproof mascara, but they do leave oily residue around the eyes. For that reason, when I wear regular non-waterproof mascara, I prefer to take it off with the other formula of Almay eye makeup remover pads that are non-oily.Both of these Almay products are great for travel as they are lightweight, thin and you can put several pads in a zip-lok baggie without taking up much space at all. I've used both formulas for many years and am very happy with them.$LABEL$1
Rechargeable battery not sold in US. One reason I chose this player is because it claims to be rechargeable through USB.

An excellent Spanish dictionary. Maria Moliner's dictionary is the most comprehensive and up-to-date product in its class. As the above reviewer notes, it contains a wealth of entries, secondary meanings, etymology, and a diversity of usage examples that truly reflect the Spanish language of the present day. This product also comes in CD version, which adds convenience since it enables users to work with it within a word processing software package.Given its numerous outstanding features, Maria Moliner's dictionary is, undoubtedly, one of the most useful tools on the Spanish language writer's desk.$LABEL$1
Great value and flexibility for the price. I have a larger router and shop built router table and wanted an smaller router for hand held use and general backup. For this price is is like getting a router table, a plunge router and an fixed base for about the price I paid for my 3HP router. The table is not the best in the world but better than any other less than $100 that I have seen. I set it up with a different bit than my main table and can easily pass from one to another. In fact, I can set this table on my larger one as needed. It includes both 1/4 and 1/2 inch collets. Very versatile.$LABEL$1

would have been better is not for marketing. There are three problems with the movie. The first of which is lighting. Ok I know is a victorian prision and it not going be the best lit place in the world, but its also just a movie so realism is not needed. The second is the structure its a bit hard to follow all the flash backs, and some extra footage puting sceans into greating contex would be been welcomed. The third is marking, as the ending shows and if follow the drug use of one main characters, its the story of one most brutal assults I have ever seen. This is what makes the book and movie much better then somthing one would see on American over the air tv or the laughable lifetime nextwork.$LABEL$0
Great Vacuum. I just received this week the Bissell Healthy Home. I had read previous reviews and was somewhat skeptical. I really like the performance of the vacuum.

For the price, it is a great machine.$LABEL$1

Beware: this is NOT Abbado's Deutsche Grammophon recording!. This recording was made during a live performance in Florence in May 1971, whereas the DG version was recorded in September 1971.

The recorded sound of the Florence production is quite awful (extremely "boxy", bothersome "humming" sound virtually throughout).$LABEL$0

It is really hard to define there music but there is some very good guitar playing especially in the live cd. The muscian's are tight i guess you could say they play a lot of different music pop/rock/a little country/blue's very good stuff. If you want to try something new from the 70's i would suggest this. I like to find old stuff from that time period that i like and this was worth the price. The opening of the story behind Mendelbaum on the liner note's state's mendelbaum was different. Musically led by the lighting fast ripping lick's of chris michie's cherry red 1968 gibson sg special. He write's most of the song's and his solo's are tight. There are five member's in the band guitar organ bass keyboard's and drum's. Very fresh music from the 70's i hope you like it as much as i have good stuff.$LABEL$1
Incredibly fun but not incredibly durable. I bought 2 of these. They fly very very well right out of the box but make sure you don't throw them anywhere that they can hit something hard like a tree or concrete. They're both still flying, but one is harder to make go far distances because it's got some wear on it lolExtremely fun to play with though if you've got the open space to throw them.$LABEL$1
Why Pan and Scan?. The Journey Of Natty Gann is the story about the adventures of a young woman from Chicago who is on the road to find her father who was sent all the way to Washington to work. Along the way, she befriends a wolf-dog(the same animal that played in the 1991 film White Fang), and a drifter. The bad thing about this dvd version is that it is only in pan and scan when it should be widescreen. We are only seeing half of the picture! DvDs were developed to make movies look as good on television screens as they did when they first came out in theaters. It is a matter of choice, but I refuse to buy any DVD, Disney included, that is not in its correct aspect ratio, and I urge anyone who feels the same way to contact them and try to get them to release a widescreen version of this movie.$LABEL$0
Great!. This is an excellent book for any age. I would recommend it to anyone. When David's girlfreind Senna (hence the title) disappears at the end of the dock, he and four other freinds must rescue her, even if it means travelling to another universe to find her. The only thing some of you might not like about it is that some of the things are a little hard-to-believe. I don't have a problem with that kind of stuff, it's just that I know some people don't like those kinds of things. (I'm just warning you)$LABEL$1
Left me without lights. After properly replacing my both my sockets, I drove for less than to hours with my head lights on, when I found that the low beam contacts both melted, and my lights simply went out.$LABEL$0
I was a little disappointed. This light works good, but I was a little dissappointed in the "belt-clip" that was supposed to "conveniently hook" to my belt. The one I received won't clip to anything, and near as I can figure, you need another part of the "system" to attach to your belt for it to work. Now I'll have to find that part or else jury-rig something...$LABEL$1
Well.... This is, of course, typical BBB house. He hits Chicago style, does some booty and then the guessable disco grooves that he's known for. Bad Boy Bill fans will love the album.One reviewer stated that "if you are looking for progressive house" that you shouldn't look to Bill. Well no kidding. BBB doesn't PLAY progressive. However, neither do Sasha and Digweed. That's called progressive and melodic trance.Please learn your genres before you go slamming an artist.$LABEL$1
"The lyrical King, from Da' Boogie Down Bronx!!". "Commentating, illustrating/ description given, adjective expert..." were the eye opening, jaw dropping, opening words on the ground-breaking, mega Hip-Hop classic, hit-single "IT'S YOURS". Although the lyrics on "IT'S YOURS" were written by his older brother "SPECIAL K" (member of the Treacherous 3), T La Rock would later team up with producer extraordinaire and master of the beat "MANTRONIK", and put out a string of classic hits through out the mid '80's. T is better known for his superb lyrical eloquence and metaphor mechanics (and giving birth to LL's original style of rap. Just listen to his first album closely). Super Rapper T La Rock has NEVER recorded a wack record. All his joints are "Funky Fresh"! This CD contains nothing less than classic, raw, B-Boy material. This is Hip-Hop in it's purest , rawest form. In T La Rock's own words "strong lyrics, no gimmicks, no yes, yes, ya'll!"$LABEL$1

Excellent video, I watch it again and again. This is an exceptional representation of Navy SEAL training. The video goes into extraordinary detail, and really makes you understand what these young men go through. Despite its length, I have watched it upwards of five times. Each time I find it educational, impressive, and inspiring. After seeing this film you understand why less than 20% of BUD/S trainees make it through, and why less than 0.5% of soldiers in the Navy are SEALs.Also highly recommended for anyone considering applying to BUD/S. It certainly lets you know what you are getting into.$LABEL$1
please print this review for others to read!. i cant say enough bad things about this cd. it sucks. please dont waste your money like i did. super cheesy lyrics, bad guitar playing, bad vocals, everything is wrong here. and who is the 'tard who produced this crap? he needs a beatin'. go buy blink 182 instead and don't waste your money on imposters.$LABEL$0

Delightfully punny!. I sat down with my 7-year old as we took turns reading the clever, witty little poem puns. I found myself laughing at the end of each pun, & my daughter occasionally stopping a moment, thinking, & finally laughing herself as she "got" the punchline. But, most of the puns she got right away. And if the 30 poems aren't reason enough to purchase this book, on the last page of the book the author/teacher includes a Word Play Guide to point out the language skill each of the poems employ (pun, idiom, personification, etc.). Making it an excellent teaching tool.$LABEL$1

great collection!. what you have here is a collection of JLO videos, for die-hard fans, and for people who just like collecting such stuff, this dvd will be a great thing to add to your collection, every single video looks just amazing, from the concept, to the dance. As someone here mentioned in the 5.1 dolbi surround you can hear the uncesored version of Play video, but this only is you have a home theatre, on your PC the sound will be awful. The thing that is really dissapointing is that not all of her videos are included, only one version of If you had my love (not a problem though for those who have the Feelin So Good dvd), of Waiting for tonight, Jenny from the block, All I have and Baby I Love U! Well nothin can be perfect, but this is not really a minus, its just a bit dissapointing, this shold've been a full collection, but...Still its a true must have for everyone! Its not about voice or something, this is just about the videos, and lets be honest Miss Lopez does this GREAT$LABEL$1
Not for me. Pillow feels squishy and soft - until you put it on the bed and try to sleep on it. Too much fill, not enough give. Too big for under my neck, causing my head to be at an awkward angle.

Idiots Guide to Publishing Magazine Articles. This book is packed with very helpful information. It is current and includes sections addressing the internet's role in magazine publishing, however the authors have devised cute section headings that make it difficult to use as a reference tool. I also noticed a focus on travel writing-so if that is your interest this book is for you. If you want a good no-frills intro to magazine publishing I would suggest "Writing and Selling Magazine Articles," by Eva Shaw.$LABEL$1
Excellent CD. I was really surprised that the Offspring could come back and make a great CD. Americana wasn't that great, and I hesitated in buying this CD, but ended up getting it for Christmas. This is a great CD for anyone who loves punk rock, and I think it's a must have for any Offspring fan.$LABEL$1

Nice gun, awful instructions. Gun feels very solid. Has a nice metal barrel and clips. Took a while to figure out the battery goes in the ris. Do not like how the ris kinda block the gun sights though. So I took ris off and installed grenade launcher. Took a while but I got it on and it was sturdy, no wobbles. Problem was that I could not find where the battery is installed in grenade launcher. If anyone knows please let me know. Ended up taking grenade launcher off and putting the grip on with ris. Did not put the sling on yet. After the hard time with the gun instructions I will battle the sling instructions another day.I do have a cm023 I got of amazon and I do like this gun better.$LABEL$1
poor value, get this music & more on other CD's. There is much good music here but some of this 3 cd box set CD is duplicated on the more recent released single CD's "West Coast Jazz", "The Steamer" & "Award Winner". Those CD's, better mixes with more bits, contain less duplication of outtakes and more other songs, particularly more ballads (see my reviews).For the same price, the prudent Getz collector will get the three Cool classics listed above, instead.This music is mostly faster bebop.$LABEL$0

Ridiculously good.. The lens is solid, easy to use and ridiculously sharp at all f-stops. It makes my Sony cameras better than they were.

Hello, it's 2011? Where is the DVD?. I've never seen this movie, but have read the book at least 3 times as it's one of my favorite stories. I'd really like to see it, but my VHS no longer works and well as everyone will agree VHS is ancient history these days. That is the only reason for the one star is because it has not come out on DVD. Come on and release in DVD! I cannot believe this isn't out in DVD format. It's ridiculous considering what movies do get put on DVD.$LABEL$0
Audiovox Goes to Maine. We recently took a road trip to Maine with our two children ages 11 and 14. I purchased 2 Audiovox DVD players and 2 cases that attach to the head rests. It was great! We took quite a few movies with us and the trip went so fast for the kids. They were easy to operate and the bonus was the ipod doc. I recommend these Audiovox DVD players to everyone with kids. They are fabulous. The screen quality is excellent and the sound is too. Oh and the kids love having thier own remotes to operate it. As I always say....happy kids...happy parents! Thank you. Mrs. S.

slap me when it's over. this is a boring read for me. too much revelry in describing everything and i mean everything. no shortage of new characters. they come and go one after another. i just wanted to get to Dracula! pacing leaves a lot to be desired. mid-read, i skipped pages when there's no action going on (believe me, still describing and describing....on and on and on....) and headed for the climax. guess what? did not miss a thing.$LABEL$0
What a Disappointment!. I had looked forward to this book very much. I am fascinated with books and their history, and the background and subject matter give this book an entirely different level for enjoyment.But I have had it with the hero: Alex Plumtree who is beginning to look more and more like the world's biggest patsy. The things which happen to him, mostly brought about by people who "have been sworn to secrecy" or who "just want to protect him" boggle the imagination. It's time he stood up to his "friends" and said, "Enough already." Unless of course he enjoys being the fool.$LABEL$0
Great tool. We had two cheap department store pepper mills that were driving me crazy. I love to cook and if you're making a large pot of anything or seasoning a roast to go in the oven it took forever to get enough pepper ground. In addition, I have carpal tunnel so not only was I frustrated, it was painful too! I didn't particularly want to spend $50-$100 to get a really "good" pepper mill. This pepper mill, like all the Oxo products I've tried, is well made and extremely well designed for doing the job it was meant for with maximum comfort and maximum efficiency. Thank goodness there are companies like Oxo!$LABEL$1

Wonderful intro to music of Portugal's former African colonies. I lucked into this CD for free(!), and I am so glad. It introduced me to Cesaria Evora and other fabulous artists from these countries.

Belly ache laughing type of funny. Bought this DVD for my kids (10,8,6,4 & 2) after watching the Flintstones movie on tv from the mid-90's. We watched season 1 in the car in route to the beach and I have NEVER heard my kids laugh so hard. It's clean, good fun for the whole family without any sexual/inappropriate undertones as you find in most kids shows/movies.$LABEL$1
Poor Release of Movie. I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time. It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning. The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my rating$LABEL$0

Great in any genre. I have read this book cover-to-cover four times. I never fail to find something new and revealing in it-some fresh aspect I had not properly explored previously. All history should be written this well. But beyond history, Connell brings a novelist's eye as to which details are telling and worth the reader's time. This book should have won the pulitzer, but that is another matter.$LABEL$1

Like A Train Wreck---I Still Watched It. This is supposed to be a remake of a French film; I haven't seen the French version, which is just as well, because a film should stand on its own merits.With the exception of several, isolated, instances, this comedy is not funny. The problem is the script and therefore the directing, pure and simple, not the acting. Regardless of the French version, this is another instance of an old, re-rehashed theme beaten to death by Hollywood: a social misfit who accidentally creates havoc gets superglued to the straight guy, driving him bonkers, but by the end of the film the misfit endears himself to the straight guy and even saves him from some problem or other. Like I said, an old, old cliche done to death (You Me and Dupree is a relatively recent one, for example; What About Bob? had the saving grace that the straight guy never embraces the misfit and is instead driven mad).$LABEL$0
Sensual, Beautiful Movie. Texas used to be owned by Mexico before the U.S. occupied Mexico City in 1847 and in 1848 a peace treaty was signed; Mexico ceded Texas, California and New Mexico (including all the present-day states of the Southwest).Anyway, I forgot about this bit of U.S. history and this movie reminded me of that, which is an enlightening part of its subplot.With this in the backdrop, the romantic love story between Tita and Pedro unfolds.If you remember ever being truly in-love, I feel some scenes will remind you of that feeling, what a nice surprise...$LABEL$1

didn't like it. I came across this book looking for one about cancer and thought it sounded (and looked) interesting. It wasn't! The whole book is just reading different e-mails the author and her friends wrote to each other, and more than half the time I didn't know what they were talking about. I didn't even know who these people were to the author (like sister, Aunt, etc., I THINK they were friends,) and what some of the things and places mentioned were. It got confusing the more I read and there wasn't much explaination about subjects being discussed, since these were just letters between two people. I found the book very boring and couldn't even get through the whole thing. Very disappointing.$LABEL$0
Simply Hilarious!!!!!!!!. This is one of the best collections of children's poetry I have come across (and I consider myself a connoisseur).

This Is Not Metal Or Even Rock. Hearing that Led Zeppelin was a heavy metal band,(and I am a huge metal fan), I decided to buy this album since I had heard it was pretty good.Well it stinks.Not anywhere on this lousy album is not even the slightest hint of metal. Actually The Beatles get heavier than this. Dy'er Maker is so un-heavy it should be included with Frank Sinatra. Only if you are a pop fan should you buy this album, so metalheads and headbangers, STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!$LABEL$0

It works for me!. Super convenient that I got three for the price of one. It takes a bit to heat up (not that I really need it to be all that hot) and there isn't an on/off switch; which I actually like since I can just plug it in, do something else (like change my clothes or whatever) then come back to work on my hair. I have curly/wavy hair so holding a curl isn't a problem at all. All I need the iron to do is to smooth out my existing curls and to shape them better, the iron does just that.I've read a lot of bad reviews on this product. Usually, curling irons that work for people with straight hair never seem to work for my hair. So maybe this iron is the opposite of the usual. Maybe it just works better for wavy/curly type of hair.$LABEL$1
Bravo Mr. Iyer!. I read this book many years ago when Cuba wasn't so much in the news and I must say that I have only the fondest memories of reading this passion packed novel. I felt every emotion whether happy or sad that the protagonists felt. It is a wonderful book that provides an accurate not exaggerated insight of how Cubans really live in Castro's Cuba. If you love the Cuban culture, its music and people, I recommend you read this novel. It will transport you to la Habana in seconds and it may even help you better understand the very sad and depressing Cuban phlight.$LABEL$1
Great and practical book. The book is very practical for advanced programmers. Definitely, it's not for beginners.Although the book was published in 2005, most guidelines are applicable today.

A Meditation for Living Right Daily. I found this book while looking for some history in thekind of meditation books for recovering alcoholics. Peoplewho have proved that their lives have changed miraculouslyby the practice of principles and living on spiritual basis.This little book is amazing. Just a few lines of encouragementeach day. Spirituality is indeed a feeding of the mind on thewholeness and beauty that comes from God. Many basic principleslearned here add peace to my life. The combination of scriptureswith little commentary is especially good for those of us lookingto feed ourselves spiritually in a short time - on the run.Sometimes you can find a real gem. This book is so simply butedifying and uplifting. To meditate on my heavly Father (fromwhom all blessings flow). Use it. I'm thankful I found it.My husband didn't read much scripture -- but he does read thislittle book.!! Thanks to the Author!!Linda$LABEL$1

Fox-Franzen Connection. Having just finished "The Corrections" and "Strong Motion", I listened to Jonathan Franzen's interview on NPR and notched up the volume when he was asked to cite his favorite works of fiction. With utmost trust in his recommendations, I then immediately acquired both of them -Fox's "Desparate Characters" and Christina Stead's "The Man Who Loved Children." "Desparate Characters" is indeed an artfully crafted, exquisitely written novella, and would make an equally artful film or stage play if Annette Benning and Kevin Spacey agreed to work together again as Sophie and Otto. Franzen's worshipful preface, however, embarrassed me for him. Perhaps that's just his way. Ms. Fox's influence on his writing is evident throughout his work and I thank him for helping me discover her voice. My teenage son discovered her voice several years ago, when he read "The Slave Dancer", so readers with adolescent children might want to point them in her direction.$LABEL$1
I really did not care for the Giver.. The Giver to me was not a good book. You could not leave in the comunity,and the life style was boring. This book was not my favorite.

Not so much.... Well, I was not very impressed with this book. Too many unexplained circumstances. No way in heck "Jazz" could pass as her twin to so many people her twin is close to.And the whole exported porn storyline? Not romantic to say the least.I wasn't impressed by the author's writing style, and there are way too many typos in the novel (she needs a better proof-reader). However, I was interested to see how the novel ended, so it did hold my attention to an extent.I don't think I will be buying more of St. Claire's books, though.$LABEL$0

The book is not the best!. It is not the best book I have read. It was really weird and freaky. The thing about it was that I didn't comprehend it much. It was really a book that doesn't suit me that much. I didn't understand it much. At times, I felt stupid reading it because I didn't understand it. If you are a person who likes reading books about fire, this book is for you.I really don't want to have to read it again and I didn't like it. It was way out of my league. I didn't care for the Ray Bradbury. But, I am not saying I hate him. I am sayinh I might tru some of his other books as well as this book that I didn't like. Although this book does not fit my categories or my type of books, I would not recommend it to other people who like serious stuff.$LABEL$0

Terrible. I enjoy Charisma Carpenter's work, I really do. But this movie - how on earth did she let herself be talked into such a woeful waste of time?

Pretty Tasty. I'm an amateur chef at best. But given the fact that these are mostly humble and slow-cooked dishes from a French brasserie (equivalent to a moderate restaurant with a large menu), the dishes come out delicious and are just plain honest.I've made the coq au vin, beouf bourgignon, and porc roti au lait with little more than a large pot, a stove top and some time (and some thyme...it's a pun).It's a great book with some great inserts of snarky wit from Tony Bourdain.$LABEL$1

Good Basic Overview, Not Current with Today's IP Technology. I expected the 2006 fourth edition to be more up to date with today's IP satellite technology. While the networking chapter discusses IP, it is in the contex of ATM and TDM technology with little or no information on current IP topologies and satellite Internet IP services like Hughes and BGAN among others. Additionally, there is no mention of current DVB-S or S2 technology which is widely deployed today. Roddy fails to make note of the broadcasting migration to IP with most of the broadcasting information somewhat dated.$LABEL$1

Is really easy to use and didn't take long for her to figure out all the cool features. Very glad I picked this camera.$LABEL$1
gets annoying real quick. well I got this a while ago, and at first, well it wasn't bad, it was catchy and a few songs stuck in my head, but I had been listening to it while I was out and busy, so when I actually sat down and listened to it and the lyrics, well I realized that it's quite awful! the lyrics don't mean anything! the music in the background is completely unoriginal...I mean they certainly didn't go out of their way to create this album.and also, what the hell is the difference between fall out boy and panic at the disco? this isn't real music. real music comes from the soul, it's like dna, no one has the same dna. well I guess there's cloning..$LABEL$0
Terrible.. At first look this gate seems like it would be the perfect gate for families with older and younger children. I was looking forward to having my older children be able to walk through the gate without climbing over and at the same time keep my little one off of the stairs. When I opened the box the gate was unusable from the beginning. The latching mechanism did not even meet the other side of the gate. It was 2 or 3 inches short of even latching.

Another Great Bruder Toy. Everything works about this set. All the parts on the loader operate smoothly and easily. The details are appropriate for the price and the intended purpose -- play -- of the set. My three year old has great fun switching out the attachments. The only negative is that when detaching and reattaching parts, it is a bit too easy to crack the plastic around the connectors. This happened to my son's set. However, even with the cracks, everything still operates well.$LABEL$1
LIGHTS ! CAMERA ! INSIGHT !. I always dismissed Orwell as someone who wrote a great book ("Animal Farm") and who otherwise "showed no leg".Wrong.The "Essays" sits like a seeming cinderblock on my nightstand, but gets nibbled at each and every night, at precisely the time when it would be so easy for me to simply go to sleep. Demonstrably, he writes well, for I do not go to sleep.Orwell is a master of the English language and of reasoned discourse. His politics are not MY politics, but who cares ? His well-written essays bid me forgive everything. Besides, there are more than a thousand pages of his "stuff" right here at my fingertips, so how could I possibly go to sleep?Thanks, George. If you wish to be paroled from the Hell to which all Socialists are sent, put me down as a reference.$LABEL$1
Too much emphasis on the program "HoTMetaL Pro". I received this book from a colleague. I was hoping touse it as an HTML reference, but I didn't find it veryuseful for that.It is very heavy on instruction in the software includedon the CD-ROM. If you are interested in Windowsshareware, this may be useful to you. If you aren'ton Windows, I would not recommend the book.$LABEL$0
recevied items much earlier than imagined. Just wait 3 days and I got the items from UPS. Very quickly. The 6 items (can) were packed well in a solid paper box.$LABEL$1
DECEPTION: The Album. I have been a great fan of Wayne Hussey, and Craig Adams since the days when they ruled the goth world with Andrew Eldrich in The Sisters of Mercy. When they departed the S.O.M and formed The Mission, their first LP First Chapter was great. Gods Own Medicine which was the follow up album was a masterpiece in my judgement. The albums that followed "Children" & "Carved in Sand" were good. Then Simon Hinckler left the band and everything that followed was a disaster. The indie release The Mask was treacherous to listen to, and much to my sadness after listening to Resurrection, I can only think back to the days of past, when The Mission UK, ruled the world.$LABEL$0
to bad you can't steer this scooter. Purchased for a 5 year old who was already riding a scooter but thought he might like a skateboard. I thought this would be perfect, but you can't make it turn at all. It only goes straight. I tried to lean on the edge to get it to turn to no avail. I wouldn't recommend this item for a child who already rides a scooter.$LABEL$0

Child abuse is not Christian. James Dobson, who wrote about proudly beating his own dog with a leather belt, gives sadistic, un-Christian advice to parents looking for help. Skip this book, practice the Golden Rule. If you think Jesus would approve of whipping little children, you need to repeat Sunday School.$LABEL$0
Reliable mechanism, but not durable. I've gone through quite a supply of breakaway collars for my cats, so I've had a chance to practically evaluate several major brands, this one included. This collar features a broad ovoid tab as the latching mechanism, and it's just hands above the snap latches on other collars. Unfortunately, the reflective material, which to me is as much a safety requirement at a reliable latch, quickly faded and the adhesive holding the reflective fabric fails, rendering the nice and otherwise durable collar ineffective within a few months. When new, the reflective material was easily bright enough to spot a kitty in the dark at a 100 yards with a single bulb AA LED flashlight, so no problem being visible in car headlights. Without the same reflective material, the cat is invisible under the same conditions. The snug latch releases easily when torqued from the side as it would when caught on a passing object or brush. This would be a 5 star review if the product were durable.$LABEL$0
What do you expect from Perfecto. One star is very generous in my opinion. The first couple of songs sound great. Progressive and dark. It sounded promising. Then as we progressed further into the cd, Hernan Cattaneo shifted toward flamey mainstream music. Save your money.$LABEL$0
Very disappointing. After years of using a 10/100 hub I decided to "upgrade" to a switch. Expecting a good product from Linksys, especially since they were acquired by Cisco, I purchased the SD208 8-port 10/100 switch. I put it on my network and the problems began. Any time I would attempt to transfer large volumes (1GB+) of data between two of my PC's the switch would freeze up on me and I'd have to unplug it and plug it back in to regain network connectivity.I've put old reliable hub back in place and I'm returning the Linksys back to Amazon. I think I'll give D-Link a try.$LABEL$0
great gift - surprisingly interesting!. I gave this book to my husband, at his request. He's an engineer, so I figured that this would be a book that interested similar minds. :) It turns out to be really facinating - our extended family and friends have enjoyed sharing it, and the photos are beautiful and interesting for all ages. My only wish is that it still was easy to find in hardback, as I think that would be nice.The book is written "story-style," which makes the information a lot more palatable to those who don't have a geology background. The historical and environmental perspectives are woven together with very thoughtful writing. There is a lot of data in this book, but I don't think it reads like a textbook, which is nice.Overall, this is a great book. It makes a wonderful gift for just about anyone who appreciates the environment or anyone who has an interest in understanding the land formations they see or live on.$LABEL$1
My tub now feels like a spa!. These are very fluffy, very soft towels as thick as anything you'd find in a quality spa.I did notice that when laundered with fabric softener they were not absorbent at all; I've read elsewhere that towels shouldn't be laundered that way. With standard (icky) towels, I've always found softener necessary to make them feel nice. With these towels, it's not necessary at all. These are scrumptiously soft and -- when laundered properly -- are not only absorbent but feel quite decadent, too!$LABEL$1
Must read book. This is an absolutely must-read book for those looking for a comprehensive view of US History. It's amazing how one-sided the history we're taught in school is. I am recommending this book to everybody.$LABEL$1
Nice film. My son went to West Point so the film caught my attention. Nice movie, especially if you are a Tyrone Power fan.$LABEL$1
Pleased!. This watch is beautiful and wears nicely on my thin wrist. I really like the flippable colors. On the whole a great buy! The only issue I've noted is that the metal dial surface scratches quite easily. In just a couple of weeks, I have a fair number of scratches and I am not a very rough user.$LABEL$1
Landscape Quilts by Nancy Zeiman... I ordered this book from 3 different vendors.the first sent me the wrong title, the second cancelled the order without informing me,the third informs me that the isbn code is wrong for this book, it does not match this title.If this book is not available it needs to be removed from Amazon.I really wanted the book and have been very frustrated.

Inexpensive, wireless, great graphics, fun for whole family.. As always, nintendo may not be doing the whole package such as HD dvd or Blue ray, or monster HD graphics, but The 480P, wireless network, unique controlers, and low price tag make this unit a very formitable competition for the X box 360 and PS3. One thing nintendo has never left out is the whole family. This unit may not have all of the violent and top selling games at the other two units, but it has plenty of games that are fun, and allowable for 5-8 year olds to play with. This is worth checking out. I'm sure you will not be dissappointed.$LABEL$1
written by a brainless fool for brainless fools..

Glad I bought the large size!. This works well and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. I put it on my cuticles every chance I get. My husband uses it on his hands too.$LABEL$1
No, no , and no. I found these to be horrible. Air pockets everywhere, even after applying via the instructions. (I used to apply vinyl graphics to glass in my career, so I know how to do this stuff...) and this was just awful. It also made it very hard to see the graphics, even in the spots without air pockets. The material is just strange.Ended up not using it at all. Good luck if you decide to try it.$LABEL$0

Vulgar Display of Music. The ex- kings of glam who trie to be a metal band only get worst with this one. I think if they replaced Phil Anselmo on vocals, they would have more chance to be a real heavy band. anyway, there are some good songs on this one. And the cover artwork, well, forget about it..$LABEL$0
Excellent *****John Merril has done his homework.. John Merril sets up three portfolios,each holding stocks bonds and cash.He takes the reader thru every bull and bear market from 1926 thru 1997. Many authors of investment books avoid the investment history of the 1930s and other prolonged bear markets but Merril wants the reader to realize the risk and the reward that comes whith investing.I would urge anyone who has a 401k plan or Ira to purchase this book. Mr.Merril may have some different views then others when it comes to indexing and foreign investing but explains his views honestly.This is a great book and I don`t know why since it`s published over a year ago that no one has reviewed it.This is a book that should be updated every year.$LABEL$1
Why was this supposed to be a masterpiece??. Here we go...I would have wanted more guitars - not necessarily distorted but imagine something like Coldplay;I would have definitely wanted a bettere technical production - this recording [is] a crying shame. Whoever did the mastering just scooped out the EQ and the result sounds hollow.. .a submarine bell allright! Vocals on some tracks are just hideously recorded... did they just take the demo scratch vocals & then built everything else around it?Unfortunately most of the stuff sounds dated and at the most sounds like an interesting demo. This leads me to thank Amazon.com for their support of second and third tier acts... I guess I'll have a fair chance of seeing my band's product distributed as well!...$LABEL$0
These run SMALL!. Right this minute I am comfortably wearing a pair of size 6 Lee boot cut jeans.I ordered these in a 9 (because I am aware jrs sizes run smaller).They are so small I can't even get them on!Not even close!Just be aware of this if you decide to order these.Otherwise they are really cute.$LABEL$0
What a waste!. There was almost nothing usefull. The collection of names is very small and the names were either completely off, or something I already know. At the same time, I am aware of many Jewish names which were not included. The book does not explain the meaning of the names either! The only more or less interesting few pages were on Jewish naming tradition. About 25% of 114 pages are filled with quotes - what a waste of paper. If I wrote a book like that, I would be ashamed to release it!$LABEL$0
The first half is awful!. The first half of this album is horrid! It sounds like a bad mariachi (sp?) band. However, the last half is very good and very danceable.$LABEL$0
Installation and Operation of SB5120 Cable Modem. The SB5120 was easy to install and put into operation. I had never installed a cable modem or wireless router. I knew nothing about installing these. However, the instructions that came with the modem were simple and easy to understand. It took about 5 minutes to install. The modem has been in operation for approximately 1 month with no issues. It's working great.$LABEL$1

so far, so good. We've had this sharpener for a little over a month now and it has been a life saver.

AWESOME!. I am a huge Neil Young fan. I own most of his releases and have been at many of his concerts since the 1980's - most recently his solo accoustic.For several years, I have been hoping for another accoustic Neil Young release. My wish came true with Silver & Gold. If you like Neil's accoustic style sound, you'll love this release. It is so soothing with intelligent, thoughtful lyrics. Think about this - with this release, this artist has had major hits in 5 decades (60's, 70's, 80's, 90's and now, 2000. Incredible. When many artists loose their touch or inspiration (not to mention their voice), Neil Young still sounds awesome. A must own!$LABEL$1
Volume "blues" keeps this little guy from being a rock star.. Some reviews on this device allude to the volume not being loud enough. After owning it for a month, I agree whole heartily. I'm a rocker..what can I say..I like my music loud(not insanely loud) but loud nonetheless. I have the much larger Zen and although I dig the reduced size of the 512TXFM, I honestly miss the volume of the Zen. I know, I know, you can mess with the equalizer..done that already..still not the same..I know, I know, you can run your MP3's through an external gain software like MP3 gain..love that MP3 gain, but why should I have to add another step before uploading my tunes into the MuVo? So, what I have been doing is uploading my tunes and then during playback I find the ones that are really low in volume(most 70's stuff) and then go in take it out, MP3gain it, put it back in......bummer..Otherwise, this is a great little product and well worth the $$$$LABEL$1
A lot of infor. The Ultimate Airbrush Handbook (Crafts Highlights)This book does cover a lot of ground. Everything from Fine Art, to Car and Motorcycles, to Finger Nails and Modelling, but I don't beleve it gives any of them the space needed to give a good comprehensive view. This book is great, if you what to know the verity of uses for an Air Brush, but if you want a of how do you do this. Find another book.$LABEL$0

Worthless. Don't buy it! It doesn't hold the bra snuggly enough so it still can fold up & crease. It's just as bad as my usual method of throwing it in a mesh bag & washing.$LABEL$0
unworkable product. These masks only work if you use one or both hands to secure them to your face. You wind up breathing more room air than oxygen because of their poor design. The bag is too small & when you exhale it blows right up into your eyes.$LABEL$0
Great introduction to DVD!. This was my first purchase of any DVD title. I had seen the video before, but the DVD quality of video and sound was awsome. Great songs, especially "silver spring", "Rhiannon", "Go Your Own Way", "Songbird", too many others to mention. Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves great music.$LABEL$1
Truly a Great Album - If you're a socially awkward weirdo from Oregon. One of the Strongest Tallica releases ever. Don't be fooled. This is an awesome album. All tracks are strong.Unnamed Feeling, St. Anger, Frantic, and Some Kind of Monster stand out as the best tracks.This with an awesome DVD is really worth the price.Highly recommended!My brother must've written this, I think the album is garbage.$LABEL$0
Misleading description, this is the TV version, NOT the movie!. I am wondering why there is no mention in the product description that this is the TELEVISION version of The Third Man with Michael Rennie and NOT the movie with Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten as the wonderful review above this describes.Unfortunately, Amazon hasn't put a system of checks and balances in place to keep this type of misleading practice from happening.$LABEL$0
The Book Bash Review. A beautiful book! A simply delightful read to share with your children. The moral lessons reach far beyond what we usually try to instill in our children.$LABEL$1
Worst Purchase I ever made... The product worked just ok for about a year with the head being replaced after the first couple of months, now I am spending more money just to try to keep it running. The unit stops after running for a day, I have replaced the battery twice, gone through two packs of cartidges and still have the same issue. The mfg. told me most folks run fine and there is nothing wrong with these, yet when I called my local MM repair shop, they told me they would add me to their 3+ page waiting list and can't promise they can even get to me this summer. This is no doubt one of the worst purchases I have ever made.. HIGHLY NOT reccomended..Use something like a can of yard guard a day, will be much cheaper and probably work better.$LABEL$0
Mingus at his best. While most of these tunes appear on other Mingus albums, this disc has the best versions; they really move, and the whole band sounds energized. I would recommend this disc to anyone interested in Mingus or looking for an introduction to his work.$LABEL$1

Attractive Braclets. Have not installed them yet, but they are just as I expected. Hanging ring on back is probably unnecessary because it is not sturdy enough to hold a shelf. Needs to be attached in a more permanent way.$LABEL$1
What else would expect for a K-body - 5 stars. If you are looking at Bessey K-Bodys, you already know how good a quality of clamp these are. I've been using the four I purchased for about a month now and have experience absolutely no issues. These 24's are perfect for edge gluing and I've made some pretty nice raised panel blanks using them.Amazon can do a better job packaging the clamps for shipping, but that is an Amazon issue, not a Bessey Issue.$LABEL$1
awesome minus one. I saw this musical at the Dominion Theatre in the West End and it was truly amazing, unlike any musical I've been to before. The audience was rocking out, waving glowsticks, clapping, and singing along by the time the cast sang "Bohemian Rhapsody" at the end. The soundtrack perfectly captures the fun of the show, and I recommend it wholeheartedly. The only downside is that "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" is omitted, quite strangely given its prominence in the show and its popularity in general. Still, the CD is entirely worth buying AND the show is definitely worth seeing if you get the chance.$LABEL$1
Another Philip Dick prpoposal. As with Blade Runner, both based on Philip Dick scifi proposals, excelent! Bluray resulted to be the best format to get involved in created scenarios.$LABEL$1
Bad acting. The movie was very boring. Mostly, because of SJ Parker. She can't act. She was so fake that I hardly made myself to finish watching it. She had the same voice, gestures, and the whole character like Paula from "Failure to launch". Additionally, I was distracted by her absolutely horrible look. This is the movie when she looked the worst.$LABEL$0
The Bean Trees. Taylor Greer encounters many obstacles in her journey headed to nowhere. She leaves her hometown looking to start a new, when a lady puts a child in the front seat of her Volkswagen and walks off. Taylor has no choice, but to take care of the child at least for a little while. But Taylor ends up loving the child more and more each day. Along her journey she meets many interesting people; Maggie- a woman that fixes cars for a living , Lou Ann- an overprotective mother and Mrs. Parsons- an old, blind woman that babysits small children. Taylor picks up a few jobs here and there, until she meets Lou Ann and moves in with her. Taylor's mission in this book is to find the child's relative's, but she never does. That's why I gave it two stars. I don't really like how the book ends, because it leaves you wondering. This book is slow paced and easy to read, if your looking for something simple it's nice.$LABEL$0
Excellant!!. This game is pretty cool, pulling over speeders and running away from the cops. It is definatly worth the price!$LABEL$1

A Night With Secret Garden. This is the best DVD live I have in my collection I have all of there CDs$LABEL$1
This Album SUCKS!. I don't have much to say about the album except that it SUCKS! It's not what I expected. Her single "Girl Fight" was a cover up. Had she stuck to this style of music she might have been alright. Don't get me wrong, the girl can sing but she needs to make wiser decisions as far as the compostion of her CD.$LABEL$0
Back to the past. Reading the reviews and listening to the album I get confused because itis, surprisingly, just a remake of her excellent album "Dry" of... 1993! It seems that, along with U2's latest, she is getting back to her roots. If that is all she could extract musically and creatively from living in New York in the last year, then I would conclude that is a lot of hype for nothing. Ifyou still want to listen to PJ,start with "Dry" and this latest is not at all compulsory.$LABEL$0
Blah.... I've read Melanie George's books before and this one is BLAH! I should have paid more attention to the one star reviews as they are very accurate! I had to force myself to read through and have no idea how I managed to get to page 28. Just decided to quit and move on, definitely a waste of time & money.$LABEL$0
Suckular at best. Luckily, my boyfriend picked this up in the $5 bin at a discount store. If he had spent anymore on this soon-to-be door stopper, I would be irate. I'd donate this to Goodwill, but it seems unfair for someone else to be duped into buying this suckular movie.I've seen and enjoyed "Wet Hot American Summer," so I thought that this film from David Wain would deliver..nope. The final scene is an absurd musical recap of the disjointed sketches. The finale just didn't work. I thought for certain that this was originally a musical/play penned by the writers, and adapted unsuccessfully into a film--I wanted desperately to think that this was not the intended product. Nope.Skip this movie. Charlton Heston's Moses made me laugh more than this wannabe religious satire. I wish I could get back the 96 minutes that I spent on this film and go to church instead.$LABEL$0
Kipper is the best!. My four year old granddaughter loves the Kipper DVD's. She watches them over and over and just loves the characters and the situations they find themselves in. Kipper is gentle fun that teaches life lessons with subtlety and grace and without being treacly. I cannot recommend them more highly than that. What fun!!!!$LABEL$1
A short well written book on Medical Aspects of Eating Disorders. This book is a gem. It is clearly written and well edited. In spite of its brevity (perhaps because of it!)it manages to pack into a neat and organized package most of the key clinical info that I need to fulfill my role as Medical Director of a Partial Hospital for E.D.s. This book helped me remember and retain (and have quickly available for cases), all the basic Medicine knowledge that is pertinent to my role; knowledge that I needed to be a Physician in the broad and well-rounded way that is necessary when treating women who are not only psychiatrically challenging, but who are often quite sick due to medical complications of their disorder. Beautifully done, and a pleasure to read as well!$LABEL$1
DEPRESSING!! Not at all what I thought it would be.. This was one of the most depressing movie I've ever seen. It was like that the whole way through. Even the ending was awful. I strongly recommend not seeing this movie. It would be a big waste of time.$LABEL$0
Low cost low quality. I have had CLP300 for 5 months now. It basically worked OK for children's school projects.I noticed a few problems with it:1. When I turn it on, the entire house light start blinking; do not know if it uses too much current2. The drum area is VERY hot and give burning smell. It stays hot even after idle for a long time3. The color tone are off a lot. It simply prints very saturated colors far off from the original pictures. I was using the original toner.$LABEL$0
Didn't work out. American Lawn Mower Company 1204-14 14-Inch Deluxe Hand Reel MowerThis mower did not work out. It was extremely hard to push and did not cut grass well. It clumped the grass clippings and what it dut it cut unevenly. I do not think even someone quite strong would be satisfied with its performance. I have used push mowers previously and this one just doesn't serve the purpose.$LABEL$0
Another Winner From Diane. This book lives up to her earlier works. It did not disappoint me in any way.$LABEL$1
Great headgear!. This is at least the third pair of these that my son has had. It is the only headgear that he has asked for again, before he always switched each time he needed new ones. Wore out one pair, only had to get a new one this time because his old ones had tape on them, all the wrestlers like to tape the straps and this year our state school association does not allow for any "modification" of headgear, so we bought these. An excellent product, I'm sure when he wears these out we will buy another.$LABEL$1
Good After Modifications. This backpack camera bag is good. Plenty of pockes and spots to hold all your photo stuff. I have a 40D, S5 IS, Minolta 370n film camera and an ultra portable camera all in this bag. i also have lens adapters and lenses for all as well. Chargers, batteries, lens cleaner. i had to make two modifications.....the handle at the top is just a nylon strap that cuts into your hand if all loaded up with camer equipment. The other one is the space reserved for your DSLR is at the top of the bag.....this is fine probably the safest place, but is lacking pading to protect your LCD...I added a couple of pieces of padding from another bag here to protect the camera a bit more...just in case.$LABEL$1
Obnoxious Series. I can't believe that anyone actually likes this show. It is the cheesiest and most ridiculous show that I have ever seen on TV. You would have to be a moron to buy this.PS: Chuck can't even do his essential roundhouse kick in the last season.$LABEL$0
Very Over Rated. This story has been told many times and in many forms. This time it's form uses a little girl, a dysfunctional family and a beauty pageant. There are the typical family losers... the motivational speaker father who is a failure at motivating anybody, the plain jane little girl who dreams of winning the "Little Miss Sunshine" Beauty pageant, the mom who has no control over anything or anybody, the brother who hates his family so much that he has stopped speaking to anybody, the uncle who has recently tried commtting suicide, and the dirty old grandfather.. Cliche to say the least. The old VW bus they go cross country in has no gears so they have to push it to start it running (you get the idea).. On the way the grandpa dies so they put him in the back of the old bus and take him along (shades of National Lampoon's Vacation)..Don't waste your money.. There is nothing cute or special about this movie.. I wish I didn't waste my money or my time.$LABEL$0

Now an old favorite. I collect breakfast cookbooks (yep, there are TONS out there!) but Marion's book has become one of my absolute faves: stained, dog-eared and notated. The Dried Fruit Cream Scones are excellent as are the Shirred Eggs, but her recipe for Pulled Bread (the easiest recipe in the world!) made me a fan for life. Many recipes have variations, and chapters consist of everything from breads to meat, as well as accompaniments including spreads and beverages and pies! Many of the recipes are ways to use up leftovers and hail from times past; don't look for new-fangled fusion cooking here, as Marion has strong opinions about not "startling" anyone that early in the morning. This is comfort food, folks, tried and true.$LABEL$1
'Reefer Madness' (Gotham Dist.) Running time: 67 minutes. When I first saw this cheezy flick at a summer midnight madness film festival twenty-some years ago,I honestly thought it was a joke.I mean,the young people in this 1938 B/W film almost make Ward and June Cleaver look cool.1938,is this right?The Three Stooges were still new at that time.If parents truly wish for their off-spring to avoid blowing weed,they may not want to choose to show them this DVD.It's SO hard to take seriously.Thank goodness there aren't any 'extra features' here.I don't think I could've taken it.'Reefer...' does have a sole purpose,to watch maybe every two years after dark when there isn't any thing good on TV.$LABEL$0
Useful Information. The coil itself works fine BUT, it does not come with "Supplied with 0.8 ohm ballast resistor, terminal and boot" like Amazon says it does. Which sucks, because now I have to order those parts seperately and wait longer to get my car running. If you need the ballast resistor, terminal and boot, order theMSD Ignition 8203 Blaster 2 Hi-Performance Coil, which includes them. Amazon, you really should change your description to match what the product comes with.$LABEL$0

No so good.... I have a five month old Puggle. I decided to buy this for her because she's a very aggressive chewer. It seemed durable and long lasting. Nope. Not so much.

Really?. I think the price of this item is a testament of how desperate people are. Do not buy this product. The older product will actually help your pet lose weight. The older version (which is a little more difficult to program) is the one you want to actually help your cat lose weight. Any intelligent cat will be able to discover how to coax the food from this feeder. Do not purchase this feeder. The older version is what you want, but it is not available and not worth your money$LABEL$0
Great product but over priced!. This definitely keeps cans cold But I believe that the price is double what it sould be. If money is no object buy it....$LABEL$0

Absolutely Addicting!. This is one of the best buys that I've made all year. (Yes, I know it's March.) I played it for hours and hours. Sleep became secondary. In fact, the only reason I'm not playing now is because my game freezes after about 2 hours of playing. I don't know if my laptop is the problem or the disk. I'm still trying to figure it out. Other than that, the game is simply amazing. You control everything. You handle ride speeds, research and development, and garbage can placement. You have to deal with bank debts, lost guests, vandelism, crashed rides, and business quotas. I highly recommend this game. Once I finish this one, I'll probably get the new Expansion Pack. If you want a great gift for someone or are thinking of getting it for yourself, BUY IT!$LABEL$1
Not what I had in mind!. I've been searching for a different shower curtain to go in a yellow bathroom and this looked perfect. When it arrived, what I thought was a white background turned out to be a darker beige linen look. The colors were very, very bright and the pattern repeated frequently. I didn't even take it out of the package, just knew at a glance it wasn't what I thought it would look like!$LABEL$0
worth its weight in gold!. We take this wagon to the farmers' market, the beach, the park, the mountains, for walks in the neighborhood, downtown, etc. For us, this wagon was a great alternative to a double stroller...with more functionality and definitely more fun. Whether you're carrying stuff, or kids, or a little of both, this wagon goes everywhere and holds up beautifully. If you take off the sides and rotate the handle completely under the base, you can even fit it in the trunk of a Nissan Altima!$LABEL$1
not worth it. I found these speakers to be average. you would be better off going with the $5 speakers available at any office supply store. the sound was decently loud, but quality degraded as the sound went up. the actual shapes of the speakers are not as pleasing as the picture might make it seem.$LABEL$0
Excellent songwriting and even better musical performances. An amazing album from the greatest Rock and Roll band in the world. Even though Little Feat has rarely gotten the recognition or praise they deserve by the rock press, they continue to get better with time. They have always been one of the tightest bands around and they have produced one of their truly classic albums. The music runs the gamut of rock, blues and jazz played in the amalgam that is Little Feats inimitable sound. If you have never heard Little Feat before, this is a good place to start along with either one of their live albums, and if you are already a Featster you won't be disappointed by their latest effort.$LABEL$1
Portable and very interactive. I too selected book primarily as it was an inexpensive book ( with good reviews) which helped meet a free shipping requirement ! what a gem.. Small yes, but my 14 month old son loves it !.The flaps are beautifully designed into the pictures and it is such a delight to see his face light up each time we lift a flap. . Yes the flaps are a little snug, but we do it together.. I loosen them as he turns the page and he then thinks he is doing it all alone ! Its nice and small, so its very transportable. I was looking for more of these... Zoo animals ???$LABEL$1
mas. overall the sound quality is better than other computer speaker system, sharp and crip. you can def hear surround effectthe only thing that i'm concerned is bass - not enough power to pump up bass, but is decent enough as long as you plug into optical$LABEL$1
boring. this is one of the most boring books i have bought in a long time. sorry, layout, context are really nothing to write home about. If you want to use it at the bottom of a pile of coffeetable books i guess it's would be fine but I am sure there are cheaper options.$LABEL$0
Poor Effort with Liberal Racist Overtones. If this one of the best books that contempory fiction writers have to offer, then the TV set and old, worn-out movie plots have little competition from the literary world. This book is poorly written and constructed. It is not intersting. It has a liberal slanted viewpoint and racial connotations. It was a disappointing read, good enough for an A++ on a high school term project, but grossly deficient for a published work of fiction.$LABEL$0
Only 1 For Price. I am pleased how quickly the capkeeper arrived. I just placed my order a few days ago, and it is already here.The capkeeper is just as promised. However, I do see a flaw in the design - the string attached is much shorter than I thought it would be.Also, I thought that 2 capkeepers were included, but I was wrong. I think that the title is a little misleading. You only get 1 for this price.*****UPDATE***** Since writing this review I have decided to no longer use capkeepers. Once the temperature rose above 70F, the adhesive consistantly moved around. Eventually it fell off. It's not worth the hassle.$LABEL$0
A thoroughly entertaining book. Smith really knows how to capture your attention and get your imagination raging. I first read The River God and was amaized to find out that there was this sequal available. Having snapped it up immediately, I set down to read the book.I was found to be in a vegetative state whilst reading the book. Completely oblivious to everything else around me until it was finished. It was very easy going and I was taken into the heart of Ethiopia where our famous Taita created the most amaizing and stunning tomb--the richest in history.I now find out that there is another book which is the sequal to this book. I assure you that that book is on its way to my post office as i write this review.Wilbur - thanks for such a lekker series of books.$LABEL$1
Personal view. Music appreciation is a very personal thing, and I can only express my own view, which others may disagree. The first thing is that I found Mr Watson's voice to be not that beautiful. The timbre is very ordinary indeed. I also found his singing to be rather charmless. It doesn't communicate. I often found the performance here bland and strident. I believe I listened with an open mind and these are merely my personal observations. Hope they won't cause any offence to anyone.$LABEL$0
Really huge mug. I love this huge mug, which holds a little over 24 oz. It's a very well made ceramic mug, and the rubber ring on the bottom is a good thing.$LABEL$1
not happy. I wish I could return the sheets. Very cheap, they stretch, fuzz, and are just cheap. Unfortunetly I bought 4 sets. I am stuck with them for this winter if they last that long. The up side the colors are great, real solid and holding the color well. thats it.$LABEL$0
Buyer beware. At the moment I am in the middle of a 3-day ordeal sorting out Outlook 2002, which comes with the ipaq. Outlook 2002 has many many many known bugs (which only now I find out) and I can't for the life of me figure out why HP would ship it with their hardware. DO NOT INSTALL OUTLOOK 2002 on your machine.The ipaq itself may be OK, but if this is a foreshadowing of the fun to come...$LABEL$0
Waste of time!. This book tops the charts for worst book I've read in quite some time. Heavy-handed characterisation, dull plotting, lots of gratuitous violence, and bad writing to boot! I mean, how can both of the women characters (there are only two, besides the 9-year old girl in danger of being molested) be the most beautiful ever? Why do they both have - I kid you not - "chalcedony" skin? Did the writers run out of words for white? I mean if you're going to be cliche, at least you could use "alabaster" or "ivory" for variation. Oh yeah, did I mention that both of these women are rape victims - one before the book, one during the book - sadly, all too typical. Too bad, because the premise looked interesting.$LABEL$0
RESPECT FOR HAMILTON, he is a real artist. I really enjoyed this CD from the first song to the last. His songs are REAL and I have alot of respect for his artistic talent and his sexy raspy voice. His songs make me feel like true R&B; music isn't being lost in the merge with pop music (because I was beginning to think J. Timberlake was going to be called our next "King of R&B;"). Bottom line Anthony sings with real soul and heart and the songs have meaning (there is a social concern).... an honest definition of R&B; soul.I ended up buying the CD for everyone in my family.My favorite song is "Charlene" but I also love "Cornbread, Fish and Collard Greens" and "Coming From Where I'm From." You won't waste your money by investing in his CD$LABEL$1
Is this for real?. Please write a review if you have seen, sat in, and/or purchased the Gray Malta Spa. I am considering buying one, but need to know whether or not it is as good a deal as it sounds.What is the size of the pump (1.5hp?)?Is the pressure sufficient from all of the jets?Does it retain heat well?What kind of warranty does it come with?How durable is the cover?Thank you.$LABEL$1
I Don't understand all the hype. Just finished this so-called masterpiece and found it to be an average read at best. Yes, there were parts that made me chuckle, but they ran about even with those that bored me enough to fast forward through some sections. I leave this book without keeping a memory of even one likeable character.I'm glad for those readers who found this book to be so enthralling. I'm glad we all don't have the same likes and opinions or it would make for a very dull world.$LABEL$0
Not that exciting. I was expecting more of a subtle plot with better character development due to the nature of the story (children who don't age until they go back out into the real world) - in my mind the story wasn't plausible. After a 100 years I would expect the characters to have more depth. I was bored with this novel and put it down around 2/3rds of the way through.$LABEL$0
Get a Clue!. Vital Idol really misses the target by not having Rebel Yell. What an embarrassing oversight!

My nephew...the doctor. My nephew is two years old and adores this Christmas present!

NO where near as Good as DAH 1. This game would be alright, had I never played the original. The original game's humor was much better. The plot was more interesting. The game's physics made the game more enjoyable. For instance, theholo-bob feature seemed a lot more sleaker than the body snatch feature in the sequel. Do your self a favor and stay away from this one, rent only.$LABEL$0
Too small for squirrels. This trap is way too small for the squirrels around me, it is more like a chipmunk or rat sized trap. I highly recommend you sketch out the measurements before buying so you can see how small it is. 5 inches by 7 inches is a very small width/height. After I got mine I went to Harbor Freight and got a larger trap for about the same price, and so far I have caught two squirrels in two days in the larger trap while this Havahart model sits nearby untouched.If you are transporting your squirrels I recommend you put the whole trap in a disposable plastic bag as they will likely pee when in the car.$LABEL$0
Sorry but..... This may be the greatest spiritual secret ever told but it has been told time and time again in a number of books, so don't buy the book because of the title. I guarantee that if you have read any spiritual books, this 'secret' will be familiar. What the book doesn't do is explain this concept' in any useful or informative way.I was disappointed in this book. I thought it badly written, unlikely and light weight. There is a book written by Gary Renard titled 'Disappearance of the Universe'. This book has massive spiritual content and is purported to be true. This is the book to read. Much better value for your money.( Link below)Rightly or wrongly I felt that this book was written for commercial reasons only.The Disappearance of the Universe: Straight Talk About Illusions, Past Lives, Religion, Sex, Politics, and the Miracles of Forgiveness$LABEL$0
Don't use the unbox. I made the decision to download to Amazon unbox to view this video.

Best I could do is send an email and hope they will help me.$LABEL$0
I needed more info on the characters. First of all, I love the literature that Nora Roberts writes. However, with this book, I felt that it lacked something that her other novels have.

urbane but stupendous ignorance, sold as profit. How can I take seriously an "expert" who devotes pages 5 and 6 of his book to trying to convince us that the Phoenicians invented talking? Does Mr. Urban really believe what he tells his readers - that, until a mere of thousand years ago when the Phoenicians came along, humankind communicated purely by drawing pictures and letting loose the occasional wordless grunt?It simply did not happen that way - ask any linguist, archeologist, or historianThe author of this work also misleads his readers on the origin of the word "phonics." Contrary to his assertion, it doesn't have to do with the word "Phoenician" at all. Checking "phonics" and "Phoenician" in any dictionary which gives word-origins will confirm that.I'd rather fail to communicate at all than communicate false-to-fact information, even for the vast sums that Hal Urban claims he makes from selling his inaccuracies to corporations and the general public.$LABEL$0

A Great Global Underground Debut. Danny Howells is the second Nubreed DJ featured in the series. Howells is an innovative and exciting DJ with that extraordinary gift to mix sets that take the electronica fan on journeys using his decks as transport.Both discs are very good in my opinion. Neither are highly innovative, but both work and the end product are two above average sets.Keep your eyes and ears on this guy. He continues to rise in rank on my personal favorite DJ list. Don't miss him live if you ever get the chance.Both disc 1 and disc 2, get 4/5 stars.$LABEL$1
ZICO AND VITACOCO. MY SON PREFERS ZICO AND I PREFER VITACOCO. Both are delicious and extremely healthy for you.When I order I get both.

These drinks have replaced soda.$LABEL$1
A little too depressing for a Self-Help book. I read Sark I know how she guest-stars Sabrina Ward-Harrison in her books, so I looked forward to reading a copy of Sabrina's book. First off: The art is gorgeous. Really. Her collages are very personal and her effort pays off hansomly. On the other hand, the content of the book itself is pretty much a big downer. There's no resolution to any of her dillemas, just a big complaint about how she feels she has no control about her esteem-lacking life. I'm sure that if I knew her I would be feeling much different. But there isn't the payoff that comes with seeing the other side of her personality. I do hope she keeps writing (she does have promise and her art is great), but her next piece has more "arc" to it from the internally repressed to the externally liberated.$LABEL$0
Better for lighter bikes. We are using this rack to store a 27lb bike. Anything heavier may be a problem, since the construction does not include a support arm and relies on the hinge mechanism.We have taken care to place the bike gently on the rack, and even then it bounces a little.Not the quality and strength we expected, however, for the price it is a four star.$LABEL$1
DON'T BUY THESE UNLESS YOU NEED COASTERS! THEY ARE GARBAGE!!. I bought 200 of these (2 - 100 disk Spindles) in June of 2004. They were GREAT! I had 4 bad burns and the rest were flawless.In October I ordered 400 more (4 - 100 disk Spindles. Apparently, Memorex went to a different manufacturer for the new disks. THESE NEW DISKS ARE AWFUL. I HAVE THROWN AWAY ALMOST ALL OF THEM. I ESTIMATE MY SUCCESS RATE IS LESS THAN 5 OUT OF 100!!!I am outraged by this and feel ripped off. I will never buy them again.

Great Small Sat replacement. I purchased these because my old JBL sats. finally died after 8 years. These are excellent replacement sats. for any installation. Great tone, wonderful range and a good sensitivity to boot. These are fill-ins until I gather enough information to buy a completely new setup, but these will make excellent rear sats. in the future as well.Overall, a great speaker for my needs.$LABEL$1

Excellent compilation.. I normally stay away from Greatest Hits cds because you tend to get cheated somehow. The songs are usually the radio (i.e. shortened) version of the original, or the Greatest Hits cd only includes the more widely accepted songs of the artist and exclude the gems that didn't get a lot of radio play. This Babyface Greatest Hits cd includes the original versions of the songs and even an extended live version of his song with Eric Clapton. This is a nice cd, even for those who feel Babyface is a little too "soft" for their taste. I would highly recommend it.$LABEL$1
A sad but powerful story that everyone should read. One of the best books I have ever read. Sad but extremely powerful. It is a must read for anyone, especially mothers who are having a difficult time coming to grips with the sexual orientation of their children.The book is well written and detailed. You feel a connection with Bobby and his mother through out the book. At times, the book can be a tear jerker. But then again, tear jerkers are the books that hit home the hardest and make their mark.$LABEL$1
This book is the best!!!. I love this book. Especially the parts about Liath. I've read the second one. Is there a third? Please tell me if you know. The storyline keeps you wondering and you don't want to put the book down. The ideas the author has come up with are great! All the magic and you wonder just what Liaths abilities are and how Alain comes into it. It's wonderfull.$LABEL$1
A good book if your not in a hurry. This is a pretty good book...It's not perfect but Frances Mayes does a great job letting us(the reader) see what she sees and tastes what she tastes.

Centrifugal Bumblepuppy. Matt Mahaffey, the creative force behind Self, has accomplished one of the most compelling and enjoyable albums I have ever heard. In his first outing on DreamWorks records, the band has produced a powerful and skilled recording full of catchy hooks, uncommon sampling and creatively appealing lyrics. All of this is backed up with competent instrumentation. This album just knocks the balls off of my chin and forces me to take notice. And notice I did. Not to say that the other tracks on this CD aren't anything less than outstanding, but be sure to pay close attention to "The End of it All", "It All Comes Out in the Wash" and "Placing the Blame".$LABEL$1
IT STINKS!!!!!!!!!. After having purchased FIVE palm III's and after throwing out all of them due to mechanical and electronical failure, I would like to say that this certain piece of plastic is nothing but plastic rubbish.

This cable was poorly manufactured. I bought this cable to listen to music on my cell phone. It does not work at all when it is plugged into the earphone jack. It only works if I push and pull the male end of the plug until I find a spot where it conducts. Since it's not in the correct position, it will not lock in place and I have to use tape in order to hold it. I have tried two other similar cables to check that it wasn't the cell phone causing the problem, and they both worked perfectly. I recommend you not buy this product.$LABEL$0
Sometimes growing up is not easy. I always enjoy Ms. Pappano's books and this is no exception. She certainly has expert touch in character studies. Ethan and Grace have a lot to over come, not only with each other but within themselves. Abuse comes in many forms and how it affects each child depends upon the individual. Ethan became wild because everyone expected him to and Grace withdrew into herself and tried to become "invisible". Good read, not just fluff. Message for all. Forgiveness would seem to be the key word...they had to forgive themselves, each other and family. Acceptance comes next. Their row to hoe will not be easy.$LABEL$1

Mediocre at best. This book basically gives you the watered-down rehashed MSDN version of .NET socket and network programming. This is a 350 page book attempting to cover all aspects of this subject including remoting and the structure of the .NET libraries without getting into much detail in each one.A mere 18 pages is devoted to server side socket programming, but even that is packed with so much fluff that a programmer winds up with too little information to implement an regular TCP socket server, much less an asynchronous one.$LABEL$0
Pass on this one.... I bought this gun a few months ago at Lowes. Most of my experience with this gun is with using 2" nails. I can report to all that this gun frequently mis-fires (dry fire). Also, the gun doesn't always 'reset' back into the proper firing position. DeWalt has missed the mark with this gun and I would not recommend it to anyone. In my opinion this gun should be recalled. Don't be lured by the good looks and light weight - the substance is not behing the style. Thank goodness Lowes took this product back - I told the customer service person that it's a RTV (return to vendor)...$LABEL$0

Stick a Fork In It. I've read this series since the first installment, and unfortunately they keep getting worse.Renie, who used to be somewhat amusing, keeps getting more and more annoying. Way too much time is spent on stupidity such as her stuffed ape being "kidnapped" and her rabbit dressed in a tutu. Her mouthiness and attitude are also no longer entertaining -- the character has become unbearable. And Judith isn't much better -- people talking to her because she smiles warmly at them has long since gotten ridiculous.When you run out of feasible reasons for your characters to be involved in murder and the reasons become as convoluted and lame as they have with this series, it's time to stick a fork in it.$LABEL$0
Zzzzzzz!. This books starts out interesting but in the middle gets REALLY SLOW - the only action being everybody's mouths flapping nonstop. I kept skipping ahead to see if anything interesting would ever happen again but it never did. Endless philosophizing, women "bonding" with each other, everybody preaching to each other, on and on ad nauseum. In real life these people would never have made it across the country because they spent 90% of their time talking.$LABEL$0
Time travel, love and getting to change history!!. I bought this book after reading a review somewhere. When i picked it up i was like ok it is good but it did get better. It is definetly for kids 15 or younger just becuase of the way it is written. However i am 21 and i liked it.After wrecking her dad's brand new BMW, she wishs (while holding her necklace) that she was anywhere else only to transported back in time. She soon finds herself in love and wanting some soap. She eventually gets back only to find that everthing has changed because she went back in time, so she goes back again to fix what she did. She even just might get the guy she loves from when she went back in time :)......$LABEL$1

Wildly over rated!. From Brooklyn myself, there are loads of bands regurgitating simplistic, non-catchy, synth meets poor guitar work ballads about the lost and lonely artists of the world, and in this case Williamsburg. This band has been blown out of proportion without the talent to back them up. I'm ashamed of touch and go records... I mean it would be one thing if they were good live, but there not! Uggh, when will music matter over style? Did I mention TV on the Radio did a fashion spread to promote their album?$LABEL$0
WORST FILM EVER MADE!!!!!. "Battlefield: Earth" is just another good example of how NOT to make a movie. Within the first 30 minutes of this garbage, I felt the need to cut out my eyes with a white hot Buck knife. Yes, ladies & gentleman, it's THAT bad.

Oh dear: what a boring life. This book could only possibly appeal to diehard ABBA fans who still want to know what made Annifrid, Benny, Bjorn and Agnetha tick. At the very least there should be some explanation for the costumes. But what Agnetha has dished is the least revealing autobiography in living memory. She retraces events familiar to any self respecting fan and ignores questions of personality, musical preference...well, just about everything that makes one want to read someone else's story. I read the book in one sitting (very easy) and haven't touched it since, despite there being some excellent photos of her and the rest of the group. If you'd like something at least a little racy I'd recommend the (probably mostly fictional) biography "The Name Of The Game", but as for "As I Am" best get on with your (probably more interesting) life.$LABEL$0
Useful book. I found this book to present a straightforward look into the complex world of neural networks. It is ideal for someone with little or no background in the subject yet covers sophisticated techniques as well. There were plenty of diagrams and many practical examples of how to use neural networks in the "real world." The software presents some challenges, however, given it predates Windows 98 and 2000. It seems to only work with US regional settings. Nevertheless, I was able to get it up and running and enjoyed the several examples and exercises described in the book. Overall, nicely written, an excellent introduction to the subject, and a good value.$LABEL$1
You need this!!!. For residential or commercial use, you can't go wrong. Working in the home improvement industry, my line of work is window and door installations. Working off a scaffold with an 18 volt cordless drill is now a thing of the past. The PS20 is a fraction of the weight of its 18 volt big brother, plus it fits conveniently in my tool pouch. It's magnetic tip keeps the screws where they belong when reaching. Don't get me wrong, my 18 volt Bosch is a workhorse but you can't beat the PS20 for its portability, power (impressive for a 12 volt), and battery life. Another great Bosch product!!!$LABEL$1
Hauntingly beautiful a true work of art!. Kaitlyn ni Donovan's Cd, Songs For 'Three Days' echos of impressionistic classical music, jazz Celtic and pop. Every track held attention. I was constantly suprised at the diversness and fluidity of the music. Lots of stringed instruments, oddest being ukulele create a delicate backdrop for the CD. I'd compare ni Donovan's vocals a bit of Enya mixed with Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins and Suzanne Vega. Lacking a lyric sheet, the lyrics I could make out seemed enigmatic and personal. Excellent introspective bedtime or reading music. Kaitlyn ni Donovan's Songs for 'Three Days' could have mass appeal if it weren't too painfully an original rare find.$LABEL$1
wannabe classic. This is just a mediocre crime novel masquerading as high literature. If you like this genre, go for established crime writers - at least they write well researched books with interesting plots. The prose is patronizing, the characters are shallow, the big bang of the beginning is an inaudible invisible whimper by page 20. The lack of research may not be obvious to an American reader, but as an Indian let me assure you that no Indian can have a name like Ray Singh (they are both last names) or Ruana Singh. I cannot believe I wasted my time reading this through to the end...with all the hype about it I felt I had to!$LABEL$0
Canto Di Primavera. The album's title sounds somewhat like a veal entree in an Italian ristorante, the contents is quite close to it too. Some instrumental passages are reminiscent of the group's early years and suggest that the former mastery is hiding behind the mediocrity of the music. A couple of exuberant songs (the title track inclusive) are variations on themes of a little shepherd girls' choir, the rest is outright boring, best when used for an acupuncture session, highly recommended for the occasion.$LABEL$0
Acetate PIllow. I am using it mainly for decoration, i.e. do not sleep with it. So it is holding up beautifully$LABEL$1
Horrible!. The cartridge didn't work. Rather than just printing text on the page it streaked dark wide black shading throughout every page. I put old cartridge back in printer and confirmed that problem is the new cartridge not my printer.$LABEL$0
Too predictable. I was hoping this would be more of an interesting story, I was quite disappointed to find out that it was a basic and very sad story. It was also quite predictable. I had expected to discover a more complex, and less sad story.$LABEL$0
Everyone should see it.. I think that everyone should see the North and South movies it is the best I love all the actors. The movie made you feel good inside and I liked how it should the good and bad people in the North and the South I think everyone should see this.$LABEL$1
I wish everyone could see this film. I just saw it last night and was deeply moved. I didn't cry watching it, but for some reason have found myself crying today as I think about the film. I won't reiterate what's been said previously by many of the reviewers--except to say this movie will move you profoundly.I've found having children changes your perspective on everything. As a father of a beautiful, wonderful 5 year-old boy, I pray for all the children out there who are subjected to similar experiences because we adults can't get it right.$LABEL$1

Connelly churns out another good novel. Connelly did it again with Lost Light. His work is everything you're looking for and yet the story is unpredictable enough to keep you reading and turning the pages. Like most characters in this genre of books, Bosch's life is written out as a chronology. In this novel he's now retired and he does reflect back, if briefly, on some of the previous cases we all read about. Its an appealing element to the Bosch series in that you find yourself relating to the character, almost as if you can imagine getting to know them. If you like Connelly, you'll probably find that this is one of his best works. You can see his continued growth as a writer and his works generally continue to get better and are more polished. Connelly shows again that he's one of the most gifted writers in this genre. All in all, another great read.$LABEL$1
All I Can Add is -- Bravo Andy Hunter!. This was a great album that I bought due to hearing the track "Go" on the video game "SSX3". I have been a long-time listener of New Age music, moreso than Techno\Trance music. I have to rate this album equal to the best offerings from Jean-Jarre and Vangelis.I can't wait for more from Andy and I hope that his sophmore effort is just as well done!$LABEL$1
Poor Design. I have owned a 395 for a couple of years now and this tool has a very flimsy drive shaft made of soft plastic. If you use it very much or for too long of a time at once, the shaft will melt and break. I would not recommend this tool until Dremel starts adding about 10 extra shafts to each kit or makes them of a more durable material that does not melt under stress.$LABEL$0
Buy a different workout. I read these reviews before I purchased this kit, but I thought the other reviews were probably from people who weren't in good shape. Well, now, I know why these workouts are free on hulu and the infomercial isn't on TV anymore. They lack sufficient warm-up, provide very little form instruction which could easily lead to injury, and are just generally ill-conceived. I was very disappointed. Save your money and buy something else.$LABEL$0
Good overall. I have had this product for I think about 6 months now and I still haven't had to change the filter. When I first got it, I did have to buy an attatchment from the hardware store for my faucet. My faucet is the kind that is supposed to look like an old farmhouse faucet, so it was a little small. The attachment was only around $1 so it wasn't a big deal. The filter does leak every now and then, epecially when I use hot water, but it doesn't leak enough to bother me. It still does what it needs to do and it saves me a ton of money on bottled water.$LABEL$1
The advice is good but.... The childish writing style gets old very quickly. If you're smart you can learn from a lot of different sources. I don't want to say there is nothing to be learned here. It's just that you can see the destination of this book long before you get there. And it's not a long book.$LABEL$0
awesome rock cd. I think this cd is great. I'm not a terribly big fan of hard rock but this cd is great to listen to if you feel like rocking hard. That said, I really like the track Drive because it shows that Incubus can be softer too, as well as Pardon Me for it's lyrics and awesome chorus. I guess one of the main reasons I like this cd is because it got me hooked on Incubus, now I can't wait to get my hands on their next cd. It's also good because Incubus is one of those bands that can really rock without using a lot of swear words. If you're looking for a good rock band or are just an Incubus fan I definitely recommend picking up this cd!$LABEL$1
"There's not going to be any evacuation!". Ouch! Man, alive, this movie almost has to be seen to be believed! How Irwin Allen convinced all these stars to even look at the script is an amazing feat! If you want a medley of disaster movies, than this one is for you, others should stay away like it was the plague. The other reviewers all correct in their statements, any other Irwin Allen disaster movie or any other disaster movie should suffice. The highlight of the movie really is James Franciscus and his overblown dialogue. As I said, if you're in for a cheesy movie with tons of stars trying to earn a few bucks to pay off some taxes or blackmail, this might be the movie for you.....others....BEVARE!$LABEL$0

Works as Advertised. First, recommend buying the accessory kit with the rotisserie.I'm very pleased with the virtual brand new condition of theunit, the completeness of the system, and the fact that it indeedworks as advertised. Have enjoyed a wonderful pork roast and beef steaks, although the latter did not brown due the shortnessof the time needed to cook medium rare. The accessory recipe book's recommended cooking times are extremely accurate. Overall, I'm delighted, and can't wait to try other recipes.$LABEL$1
Lifesaver. This is a must have when your tv doesn't have enough a/v connectors. Even though the manual was missing, it took less than 5 minutes to conncet the Direct TV, vcr & television. The little remote is very handy, we just attached a piece of velcro to it & keep it with the tv remote. This tiny little expander takes up little room, you can place it on top of your other items or on the side of the television. I LOVE IT!!!$LABEL$1
Amazing!. I don't really want to fill this out. Don't waste your time reading right now, just get thee to a theater to see this movie! Theron is amazing in this role. Who knew? Now, WE do! I totally forgot there was an actor on that screen, and believed this was Aileen Wuornos. The only real disappointment was in Ms. Ricci's performance. Either the character was not developed enough or she just wasn't into it. She seemed to play one note, and that was whiney baby dyke. Theron, however, did not let those less capable prevent her from blowing other Oscar competition out of the water.Thank you Patty Jenkins for doing this film, and thank you Charlize for your passion and talent and having the guts to let us see what you can do. Not an easy thing, but lady, you've got it!$LABEL$1

irritating piece of research. Anyone doing research into the history of anaesthesia should check this out, but this should definitely not be the last or only word on the controversy. Historians tend to disagree on who should be credited with the discovery of anaesthesia in the United States: Wells or Morton. MacQuitty plants herself well within the Morton supporter's camp, oversimplifying a complex series of human interactions and relationships by dismissing Wells' role in the "discovery" (excuse the scare quotes) and adpotion of surgical anaesthesia, especially when treating ether, nitrous oxide, and cholorform as historically identical substances.$LABEL$0
This box set shows Judy at her best throughout her life.. I have this set, and it is really great! It includes 4 CD's, a book and a video. It has most of her best solos and a few duets. I listen to the CD's over and over. The book has dozens of photos, and the video shows Judy on her short-lived T.V. show. This is a great gift for any Judy fan, because it features the World's Greatest Entertainer, Miss Judy Garland!$LABEL$1
Good Equipment. I purchased this because I do alot of number punching at work and I hate using the embedded keypad on the top row of the laptop I use. The install was easy and the driver also includes a calculator software with number transfering capabilities as well. I found it useless, but it [work for] many poeple's needs. My only Gripe is that the cable comes out of it on the right hand side, if you have it on the right side of the keyboard it has to go back around to the left side. No big deal but it is just kinda quirkie and thought that I would throw that in.Other than that it is awesome, the keys respond like it is an embedded keyboard and it doesn't hog a usb port, I know some have the hub but a co-worker has one like that and the hub on it doesn't work so I figured go with the Serial port and not use the USB... I own nothing else that uses a serial port so it works out great.$LABEL$1
perfect feeder. This feeder was exactly what I was looking for. The product was improved by making the flower white to cut down on attracting bees. It is the perfect size since humming birds are lone feeders and you do not need many ports since only one will feed at a time. It allows me to buy more and spread them out around the house to cut down on the fighting over a feeder. I had no problem with leakage. It was a great year for my humming birds thanks to this product.$LABEL$1

Oh Boy! It finished teaching HTML..... I thought this book was supposed to be teaching us XML but it goes on about HTML and how it is the distant cousin of XML and how XML is soon going to be the parent of HTML. The author hasn't even tried to get in-depth of the whole XML concept it seems as though the author just wanted to get a book out and here was a great opportunity for her. The author gets into a subject and does not explain it there and then instead you are referred to another "Skill" in the book. That becomes frustrating. If you really want to learn XML better get another book, you will be wasting your time, money and mind on this book.$LABEL$0
Not the best. This CD originally appeared as part of the 5 disc COLLECTION and as such doesn't stand up as a reording in it's own right. Much of the material is from John's latter works so will only be of interest if you havn't got the original albums. Unfortunately the excellent the title track and FALLING LEAVES fail to lift this hotch potch above the mediocre. Only recommended if you are determined to own any collection of John's that you can get your hands on.$LABEL$0

I want more. This CD/DVD set is great, but I really wish they had taped the whole concert like they did the one at Wrigley Field. All of the songs are on the CD and you get to hear Jimmy's comments to the audience which many times make the show. But there is only about an hour of the actual concert on the DVD. I would have preferred that they tape the whole concert and sell it separately. However, in my case something is better than nothing so I would recommend this set.$LABEL$1
Different strokes for different folks. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I happen to think that the first CD is crap and I love the second CD. It just goes to show you, don't listen to what half of these people say, Get what you want because it's what you like. The first Cd is to much trance for me to handle, the second CD was great soulful house music with a latin flavor. I enjoy most of the Knee Deep remixes and it's nice to finally have 'pasilda' on disc.$LABEL$1

Unblack to the core!!!. This is no joke. This is the real deal for Unblack Metal. We stay true to glorifying Christ and to His Message. "Invert the Inverted Cross" says it all! This is not a rip-off of Darkthrone or any other Black Metal band. This is simply giving you the other side of the story, the TRUE side!This music is for those who have drowned themselves in the lies that Black Metal has told. This music is atmospheric and truly a classic! It existed long enough to say what needed to be said. The lyrics are extreme, just as Christianity is. You can burn our churches and kill our people, but God has the ultimate victory!Hail the Eternal Emporer, Jesus Christ!Love,Servus Dei from Offertory$LABEL$1
Good Product. I've been using the Sony Dect 6.0 for 2 months now as a replacement for a Sony 900 mhz cordless product that gave us over 15 years of good service. Range, clarity and battery life are exceptional. There are more features available than I will ever need or use. I have no complaints and rate the product 5 stars across the board.$LABEL$1
Pretty . . . and Flimsy. Cool glowing lighted keyboard . . . combined with flimsy build quality and it's a gigantic waste of money. If you are a power user or have a tendency to be a little firm on the keyboard, do not buy this model. It is not sturdy at all. If you like the cool glow, get a lava lamp instead plus a real keyboard-- and have some money left over.$LABEL$0
Almost as good as No!. 'Here Come the ABCs' is a very good children's record/dvd. It is really well made and although it is made for pre-schoolers, it isn't annoying for a parent/adult.The animations and videos on the dvd are very intersting too, even though the budget for them was clearly low.It is obvioulsy made for a younger crowd than NO! was, but still, it's almost as good and entertaining for any TMBG fan.I say definitely worth buying.$LABEL$1
Powerful read!. Tim gives an excellant portrayal of PTSD in action. This is a book I recommend for Vietnam vetswho can relate who suffer from memories from the Vietnam war. He shares so compassionatelythe pain and sorrow only another vet can know that words cannot speak. The slow-motion memories ofwar that come back to haunt. Beautifully written and depicted grief release from one vet to any other who lived it.$LABEL$1

Don't waste your time!. I just rented this and wow, I want those two hours of my life back. Me being a marine biologist myself, I was interested in this movie but it turned out to be downright terrible.

Good idea, poor presentation.. The author needs to take creative writing classes. The language was stilted, and the dialogue artificial, both deadly sins in my opinion, especially when the subject - kids being trained as terrorists - could have been so compelling.

8th day of christmas 2011 review. On the 8th day of christmas 2011 Im going to review...Child's Play. There are so many plotholes in this film that I can't type them all in one sitting. The acting is terrible at best. The premise is preposterous & stupid. The devices that made Chucky look like he was real are faulty at best. Worst of all,even thought the cast saids that Chucky's body is becoming more human,he can still move & LIVE without a head,with one arm and with only one leg. They to shoot it like a million times before he goes down for the count for good. Overall,while it is scary for some people,it's dated at best. I give this movie a 2 and a half out of 10.$LABEL$0
They just keep getting better!. After seeing the show True Blood on HBO this past year I just had to know more about Sookie's world. I thought the series started a little slow with Dead Until Dark but DEFINITELY picked up with Living Dead In Dallas. Club Dead blew me away! I LOVED IT! I picked it up four days ago and finished last night. I'm already two chapters into Dead to the world. I love the development of the characters relationships. Especially Sookie and Eric. I have a BIG crush on Eric! haha. GREAT SERIES SO FAR! I look forward to the rest of the series.$LABEL$1
Poor Syntax, Spelling, and Lack of a Translator. I would be careful purchasing this edition of The Master and Margarita. The lack of a translator was apparent with misspelled words (haze, spelled ha2e), poor sentence structure (often lacking a verb), and the spacing was not indicative of who was speaking.I have since gone on and purchased the edition by Picador and find it an entrancing read. I realize now how much I missed out of the first three chapter of the edition I purchased from Amazon by Classic House Publishing.$LABEL$0

A Very Underrated Movie. I saw this movie on TV about 10 years ago while channel surfing and loved it so much I could not get it out of my head. I had to buy a used VHS tape as there is no DVD available in US.William Holden and David Niven are terrific but the best in the cast is Maggie McNamara and I wish she had done more movie work. The dialogue is witty and the story is charming.With all the trash being put on DVD it is a shame that this little gem is not. It is also fairly hard to find the tape and it is not cheap but it is worth paying a higher price for.Again, the biggest asset of this movie is Maggie McNamara and you will not get to see her in anything else of this caliber.$LABEL$1
Loved It. Everyone that has commented seem to think the movie was awful.. Me on the other hand has never watched the Avartar Airbender cartoon.. So maybe I don't know what it should have or shouldn't have been .. But I really enjoyed the movie.. And i'm a strong movie buff of any Fantasy Movie as long as their is a story line.I actually hope their is a 2 on the horizon. And any way it was only for entertainment.. Not to build my life on.. So i give it a big thumbs up and to me the special effects was awesome.The actors did a good job on bringing to movie to life. I wasn't trying to pick the movie a part but to enjoy the movie. But then thats just my opinion. I would recommen you watching it and forming your own opinion.$LABEL$1
Too general. There was not enough information as far as I was concerned. I think there are other books out there that are more specific and contain far more information.$LABEL$0
Not My Favorite. I love almost everything written by Georgette Heyer. And this book is one of the reasons why I say "almost"...This book is more of a Gothic-style romance, but even considering that, I found it a creepy and unpleasant read. And if you are looking for a romance novel, there is very little focus on the romance and more on the weird goings-on of possibly deranged family members.I would steer clear of this one! She has so many other great novels, don't waste your time here.I'd give it a one-star, but I just can't do that to a Heyer novel.$LABEL$0
DON'T READ!!!!! BAD INFO!!!!!!!!!. I just want to say that i love 98 Degrees!!!! I love their music, their looks, and their down to earth attitudes. So don't get me wrong when i say i don't like this book. It has nothing to do with them. The one who wrote this book can't even get their names right. She keeps on calling Jeff....Jeff Lachey. If you are going to write a book about someone you should at least get their names right. Plus it was so chessy. One part is like Nick is sad....Nick is lonely.....He is wearing only his boxers and his tattoos. He has tons of girls numbers but no true love. He wonders if there is any yoo-hoo in the fridge. It gets annoying. Plus when she talks about the songs she gets the parts wrong of who sings what. I know everyone may not know everything about 98 but if you are going to write a book about them you should get your facts straight. Anyone go get their offical book when it comes out. Don't waste your time or money with this one!$LABEL$0

Better to save your money. Having read Hernandez's high-powered "A is for Admissions," I was very disappointed by this product resulting from the collaboration of two seeming experts. Each page contains one advice, with only a few sentences of explanation, so the content of the book could've easily been compacted into fewer pages. Also, the advice seems to be a downgrade compared to those offered in Hernandez's other book; some are rehashed, while others non-brainers. Save your money and time by avoiding this book. If you want sound admissions advice, get Hernandez's other book instead.$LABEL$0
HP1209 = JUNK. The FUNCTIONS of this printer/copier/scanner are AWESOME, but the QUALITY is absolute GARBAGE. For about the first 6 months, this printer would handle envelope printing reasonably well, but after that printing envelopes is essentially impossible. The printer usually destroys 3-4 envelopes before it gets one that is marginally acceptable. Additionally frustrating is that - like many HP printers - there is no reasonable way to extract paper jams. Also, the software that comes with the printer is NOT user-friendly. Finally, after recently re-installing Windows XP, the HP driver software (unnecessarily) re-installs the printer drivers EVERY time the computer boots up; sometimes it re-installs the printer drivers at random times. This is VERY FRUSTRATING.$LABEL$0
Extremely pleased. The Xpad is everything I expected and more. It has a non-slip surface, it eliminates all heat between the laptop and my legs.

Poor Quality..Bad Choice... I had purchased Xerox 470, and had to swap it back 3 times for a new machine from XEROX because the paper wouldn't feed without jamming or the rollers wouldn't grab a single sheet [grabbed 5 etc.] Each machine i replaced experienced the exact same problems. Furthermore the ink cartridges are a ripoff because they do not last long and even though there maybe ink left, once the machine says "low ink" you cannot overide and keep printing. I did find XEROX support good, however this product was so poor that i simply ended up giving it away to a charity.$LABEL$0

Kindle edition problems. I haven't yet been able to read the book, but the Kindle edition has a serious flaw. The type is very small.

Two Damfools (three, counting moi). I remember the afternoon in 1968 when I walked into downtown New Haven's Merle's Record Rack and was shown with great furtiveness a NEW John Lennon LP that was being kept UNDER the counter. It was literally encased in a brown paper slipcover that revealed only John's and Yoko's b&w; faces.As if being let in on a big conspiracy, I was told that the Beatle and his wife were totally naked on the cover: frontal nudity and rear nakedness on the LP sleeve's flip. So, like a dummy I laid out good money for what is TOTAL GARBAGE.Noise. Junk. Offal. Piffle. You pick the negatory noun.The photos are ugly. The recordings are uglier. This is the barrel bottom of Sixties crapola, and that's coming from a devoted John Lennon fan.Please don't make the same mistake I did way back when.$LABEL$0
A Great Actor in a Great Role. Spencer Tracy is a great actor and in The Last Hurrah he plays an old school politician, the Mayor of a Boston-like city. His nephew, a journalist, is the eyes and ears for the audience and we see Tracy's character doing the good and the not so good in his position as Mayor. This is a great story with a great cast (Basil Rathbone, John Carradine).$LABEL$1
Brainless, Shallow, and Absolutely Hilarious. This film is from the same wackos who gave us Airplane, Police Academy, and Naked Gun. If you've seen even just one of these, you pretty much know what to expect from this one. Except for one thing: for sheer mindless fun, Top Secret tops them all.The movie stars a young (and apparently not very role-choosy) Val Kilmer as a teen rock n' roll idol who goes on a road tour in East Germany, where he meets and falls in love with Hilary (Lucy Gutteridge), who enlists his aid to rescue her scientist father.But really, who cares about the plot? Watch this show for the deliciously insane gags. I won't even mention a single one of them, because they have to be seen to be believed.Sure, the humor is unsophisticated. Even dumb. But that's the point. We all have to treat ourselves to this sort of lunacy now and then. And I'd have to say that Top Secret is the best way to do just that.$LABEL$1
Uneven. "The Tommyknockers" starts as many of King books do. Something unusual happens to a Maine resident, a blue-jeans everyman.

The Blue Cheer of the New Millenium. If you have been waiting for the followup to Vincebus Eruptum for 40 years, hoping to find it each time a new group popped up promising to deliver but never really doing it, well this is IT!

Well Crafted Lyrics. Listen to "Yummy Down on This". Ignoring the song's perverted subject matter, you have to admit that the lyrics were very intelligently crafted. Jimmy Pop obviously spent a good deal of time getting these lyrics to flow smoothly, often with several different levels of meaning. The other songs on this album have many of the same characteristics.Guys may tend to relate to some of the songs more than the gals. In fact, most women will probably find songs like "A Lap Dance Is So Much Better When The Stripper Is Crying" offensive. Come to think of it, this song manages to press almost every offensive button imaginable.The bottom line: This album is very vulgar and perverted, BUT contains lyrics that are much more complex (hidden meanings and subtle humor) than most rap albums out today.$LABEL$1

I keep talking to myself!!!. I loved the features that this phone offered, you could upload photos (not that I ended up doing it) or music to create your own ringtone. However, I would end up on the phone talking to myself at least a few times a week! If you are on the phone longer than 30 minutes the person you WERE talking to can no longer hear you, which sent you searching for the other handset! You could still hear them.So after about 3 months of this problem my friends and family already knew, if I didn't respond to them it wasn't because I wasn't paying attention!The battery began to die sooner and sooner around the 1 year mark as well.$LABEL$0

The MM275 is cheap and flimsy. I bought the Black And Decker MM275 based only on an Amazon recommendation. Within minutes of using this lawn mower I knew that my purchase of the MM275 was a mistake.Cons:* The bar height is not adjustable. I'm 5'11", and the bar is below my waist, which is uncomfortable.* The power switch is mushy soft plastic, like a chew toy for a dog. This essential part feels like it will break within a year, and reviews of similar Black And Decker lawn mowers say that it does.* The power connector doesn't have a lock or clip, so the power cord falls out. You'll need to tape or glue the power cord to the switch housing.* The motor is under-powered. I had to mow my lawn twice to get an even cut.* The shroud has a big nose. You can't do edges with this mower.Pros:* Very light. You can mow with one hand.$LABEL$0
Easy to install... also works for 96 Infiniti I30. I didn't realize that it is so easy to replace hood struts until I saw a video on youtube. I was still a bit skeptical if I can DIY.

Works great and easy to install. This is such a great addition to the 14 inch Jet bandsaw that I'm surprised Jet doesn't just make it standard on all their 14 inch saws. I was able to install it by myself, and I'm an old guy. I rigged a rope from the ceiling to support the top arm of the saw, disconnected the bolt, and lowered it to the floor. After that, the installation goes very easy and straightforward. Putting the top arm back on was the opposite of taking it off, but be sure that you can tie off the rope so you can use both hands to tighten the bolt.The only negative is the blade that ships with the riser block - it's not very good. Buy yourself a selection of Timber Wolf blades to use for resawing.Having the extra resaw capability if really nice and increases the usefulness of the saw. I recommend this accessory.$LABEL$1
Wait to buy til they ditch the music. I had read several reviews on "James Earl Jones Reads the Bible" and most of them mentioned the music--some positive, some merely accepting, and some very negative. Because I've been searching for an unembellished, undramatized reading of the Scriptures, this should have sent up a red flag to stop me from purchasing it. However, I figured with James Earl Jones' marvelous voice, how bad could it be? I would suggest you hold off buying it until they produce another one without the loud, lame and distracting music and give us the choice.$LABEL$0
A great book. Jon Krakauer has been very lucky with his assignments with Outside Magazine. Granted, getting stuck in a blizzard on Mt Everest isn't what most people would describe as lucky; however, he sure has profitted fom writing Into The Wild and Into Thin Air. This book is very well researched but does tend to drag at points, especially when he brings in his own personal accounts. Over all, I would say he's an alright writer who has benefitted from being at the right place at the right time. This book is definitely worth your time.$LABEL$1
THIS IS A CHILDREN'S BOOK. I like to think I have read a lot of books in my day, and the most important thing to keep in mind when reading something is know the context of what is being written, make no mistake, this book was written for people too immature to read Harry Potter. The plot and characters are underdeveloped. The whole thing is a huge Tolkien ripoff (but so is most Fantasy). This book is for first time fantasy readers who are 8 to 12. But before reading this i would recomend reading Harry Potter and the Wheel Of Time so you have and idea of what good Fantasy is.i will admit it was entertaining but anyone who gives this 5 stars needs to read a Game of Thrones by George RR Martin and know what quality fantasy is. This is not quality, it is some kid trying to scrape money together to pay for college and taking the easy way out without making his book worth reading.$LABEL$0
Questionable benefit. I am unsure of the benefit of using this CD lens cleaner. It MAY have solved the problem of a dirty/dusty lens, but it may not have, as the problem on one CD player was only temporarily resolved. Another CD player that otherwise worked fine could not recognize this disc at all, and on all of my players that did, it could not advance to the third track, which contains only music. Significant skipping was noticed on all CD players, including those that never skip on other discs. If nothing else, this cleaner may provide a superficial and temporary fix, but if your CD player's lens needs cleaning, there are likely better and more effective ways of solving the problem.$LABEL$0
Character studies in surburbia. Frank and April Wheeler on the outside are the "perfect couple" living in suburban Connecticut with their two children. Behind closed doors, though, April is a failed actress (that she is played in the film version by the terrific Kate Winslet is ironic) and Frank endures the drudgery of a 9-to-5 job. Planning to move to Paris and fulfill their expectations of greatness, Frank and April's shared life shatters with revelations of infidelity and broken promises. A lot of people pretend to be something they're not; this isn't new, but Richard Yates brings a fresh look to 1950s hopefulness and optimism in his dark look at marriage and coupledom.$LABEL$1
Not too Durable. I used the beanbag mount for the Garmin iQue product. When I purchased the C550, I tried the suction cup mount but I could never get it to stick to the windshield for more than a few days. I purchased the Garmin Dashboard mount and it lasted three weeks, or until the first really hot day. The car is kept garaged during the day and at night so it was only one day of heavy sunshine needed to separate the base from the dashboard. I wound up with the C550 in my lap at 60 mph.I can't recommend this product to anyone due to safety concerns. If the glue had separated during a tight turn, it could have resulted in an accident.For now, I'm going back to the beanbag mount but I'll give careful consideration to a factory-installed GPS in my next car.Bob$LABEL$0
a good one but not great.. Teh first three free cd's are filled with alot of hard blues rockin and ballads. The feel here is more laid back , and this is close in some ways to 'free at last' but this isn't a bad cd at all. It has many bonus tracks and the sound is excellent. The music though is good , but not standout , and even if he cover had said 'free' highway instead of just highway" , I don't think that this would have been a big hit. It would have sold more though than it did. This is good cd it's just not as powerful as 'heartbreaker' or 'tons of sobs' or 'free'. The songs are good guitar driven songs but they are mostly mellow. And that's good too. It's a good mellow rock cd mostly. So if you like mellow rock and laid back songs with a few rockers then this one is for you.$LABEL$1
What went wrong??. I started listening to 'ryche with Rage for order, which is outstanding. I anxiously awaited Mindcrime, which was even better. I enthusiastically awaited Empire.

Sexual braggadocio from a smart, conceited Italian. Alberto Bevilacqua is an accomplished novelist and, I now know, quite the man about town. This book is all about the women he's known, about how exquisitely sensitive he was and is to them; about men, his friends, and his life. It's full of bragging and posturing. He is pretty good at describing sexual acts, bodies, and female orgasm, but one of those orgasms -- fantastic, never-to-be-forgotten -- he believes he incited in one of the women he writes about was less impressive -- to this reader -- than he intended. (What if she was faking?) I liked his memories of his very young adolescence. This book was adored in Italy but I would guess that they saw right through it in France.$LABEL$0

Didn't love it.... This book started out ok, but the middle and end were very disappointing. I never found the love story to be very believable, nor the decisions made by Miranda. I couldn't see the relationship of the two main characters lasting. They were so different in every way, with no shared views, and they didn't even really seem to be in love! The ending was totally illogical. I would have given one star but I did enjoy the beginning of the book so I gave two instead.... plus at least it wasn't boring.$LABEL$0
No HDMI ????. This appears to be a well-made unit, with many excellent features save one (which is the kiss of death for any "current" DVD player): IT HAS NO HDMI OUTPUT.What this means, of course, is that it cannot be attached to any modern HDMI LCTV with the "single" HDMI cable and must be connected with the bundle of composite cables - YUK.One other note: the supplied IR remote control, while well-designed from an ergonomic perspective, would only connect with the player when DIRECTLY pointed (as in "exactly") the player unit. Not handy in larger rooms or when the player is in a slightly off-side location.But the lack of HDMI is the deal-killer with this one. Ouch!$LABEL$0

Pretentious, dry and BORING!. I excitedly bought this book after hearing wonderful things about it from friends, fellow students and teachers. I was profoundly disappointed. Moore never actually guides one through "cultivating depth and sacredness". He lectures about subjects that the average reader cares little about. There are a great many books out there that are infinitely more accessible to the common reader. I suggest that they be sought out. This book is thoroughly unenjoyable.$LABEL$0
A space opera reminiscent of star wars. An easy read that will make you feel good, but not very challenged. There is usually little doubt as to what will happen next, but the characters are interesting at times (even if they are somewhat cariacatured). The warlike Barryarans and peacenik Betans don't display much variety, but the character of Miles Vorkosigan is interesting to read in action. Lois Bujold gets better with her later novels about this strange universe set in a future where humans migrated to the stars as tribes and lost touch with each other for a time and then found each other again. The Barrayarans appear to be made to resemble the Soviets (warlike and totalitarian), while the Betans are Anglo-American democratic pacifists. All in all Bujold is a good writer (as she proves with some later adventures starring Miles), but here she appears to be experimenting and growing still. Not bad and not the best, but it's a better read than most other science fiction out there.$LABEL$1
A truly magical album. I can still remember the feeling of electric delight that went through me when I first heard this album. While cynics can dismiss it as derivative, obnoxious, mindless frat-rock, I feel like they're missing out. This album is the most visceral expression of joy I have ever heard. It's triumphant, vibrant and elating. Exploding with hedonistic zeal, this is an album about being alive and present in the purest sense. Whether one enjoys it ironically or sincerely, the feeling is the same: delighting, uplifting and intoxicating. And in case anyone is wondering, I'm being dead serious.$LABEL$1

T-fal Iron. In the short time that I have been using the T-fal iron, I have been impressed with the smoothness of the soleplate, as well as the Easycord System.

However, the Manual should be consulted in depth prior to use of the iron, and its precautions adhered to.$LABEL$1
Getting rid of this toy today. My baby received this toy as a gift, even though it's a good looking toy, I am concern about my baby's safety, He doesn't walk yet, so I used it in the sitting mode, today my baby was riding it and he tried to reach the front toys, in a flash the car roll over itself getting upside down, my baby's forehead went straight to the floor, thanks God our floor is carpeted and he was far away from furniture.

Great Fuzz buster!. This detector has saved me already a few times on the highway. I purchased it because I used to drive a sluggish SUV, and now find my self driving a new sports coup far faster than I am used to. To be on the safe side, I got this to be precautionary. The distance it can detect in a straight line is great. I do have questions about how well it can detect from behind but so far so good. I do like the blue lights that go off to alert you, but they will make you jumpy when driving at night on the highway and they go off like a cop is already on your tail. Great for price and like the City mode that mutes false alerts.$LABEL$1

Disappointed as well,.

Exciting!. With his first novel, Dan Blankenship shows he has a real gift for writing. The Running Girl is suspenseful and exciting! The classic tale of good versus evil. The characters are well written into the author's vivid imagination. This book shows a positive family situation with a good message and I would classify this book as Christian reading. There are a lot of religious beliefs and ideas that may not be shared by all readers. I look forward to reading more suspense writing in the mainstream from this author.$LABEL$1
Good bag for a small camera.. I bought this bag because Amazon had a big discount on this bag if bought with the Nikon D40x. I don't understand because this bag is soo small for a DSLR like the D40x. The only way I can carry a lens with the camera is if I leave the 18-55mm attached to the body, and then orient it upright. However, for a point and shoot or a prosumer camera, this is a great bag. (Although I don't know why you would need all this space for a point and shoot) It's got lots of pockets and is very sturdy. Couple of useless things on the bag, the zipper to close the inside body is very hard to close and not necessary. Also, not much you can fit into the little zippered pocket on the top flap of the bag.I am speaking about this bag from a camera point of view though. I can see how this bag would be quite useful and spacious for a digital video camera.$LABEL$1
Great book. Great book. Really practical, clear, balanced and logical. I've read a lot of books in this area of study lately and it is unquestionably one of the best. A good balance using the most pertinent information from cognitive behavioral, psychotherapy and spiritual studies. The case studies are great. It's nicely grounded. I underlined many passages and find it helpful to just go back and read the underlines. It's been helpful both personally and in my work with clients. It's a book I've recommended to many people already.$LABEL$1
Great Fun. I have read some negative comments on this game, all I have to say to is, where's your sense of fun? This games does not pretend to be a simulator, it's an arcade action game based on WWII. I've had hours of fun with this game, sure some of the missions are hard but it's still great fun. The graphics and sound are all great. It's all done very tongue-in-cheekIf you want some fun action then give it a look.$LABEL$1
Not fun. This game is small in stature, much like the other "House of Marbles" games we have owned. I bought this game, along with "Hoopla" because they were both on clearance.

My kids grew frustrated with this game rather quickly, and it hasn't been out of the closet since.$LABEL$0
Expensive junk. This router has been nothing but an expensive pain, a black hole for troubleshooting, and Cisco/ Linksys stopped supporting the first versions of it very soon after I purchased one. Obviously, they would like to pretend they never made this device. The N wireless is slow, disconnects, and has no range at times. Perhaps disable the wireless and use it as an expensive little switch? Not sure it can be trusted for that. They should have been recalled!

The Kennedys. I ordered this movie for my husband because he had seen the show on tv and he wanted the DVD. When we got it we set down and watched it in two nights and it was really good.

Sorry but who sings the songs is as important as the songs. The conductor and the singers can make a beautiful song the opera that everyone jeers and hates.

Mediocre At Best. Another reviewer said that it is lamentable that MIT is no longer using this book. I'm an MIT student that had to use this book and am very happy that MIT had enough sense to change texts. The explanations were poor and it was almost devoid of decent pictures (visualizing is VERY important in calculus). Also, the examples were next to useless. I wound up using my high school AP Calculus book by Thomas/Finney (I think this is the book MIT uses now) rather than this text. There are a number of excellent Calculus books published, but this isn't one of them. Anybody who says this is the best calculus book hasn't reviewed many books.$LABEL$0

Ancient Economics 101. After taking yet another one of Prof. Figueira's courses on the ancient world, I was pleased to read something that was less overpowering to my mind. I think that Profs.

They were able to apply concepts that we readily know now, to a world that we won't understand immediately. In particular the emphasis on ancient coinage was employed well.$LABEL$1

Wipe my butt with this album. I liked camron's first album. He came off to me as an MC who has talent and needs to grow into his style and song content. But over the years, Cam hasn't grown and has become increasingly ignorant. What man would drown himself in pink outfits? Cam you are a man (at least I thought so) not a woman. Pink outfits are not cool. Him and his wack underlings (diplomats) need to find the nearest Super K mart and start their promising careers as stock boys.

Their best album...Technical deathmetal, at its best!. Cryptopsy are a band that althought their sound changed quite a bit? They still manage to come out with some amazing music..."None so vile" by cryptopsy is in my opinion their best album todate and its even better then their debut "blasphemy made flesh" which was a very amazing technical album but had horrible production. Now onto, "none so vile" ? If you love your deathmetal technical,intelligent, amazing drummer (Flo) and originality for days? Get this album!As for the vocals ? I prefer lordworn's vocals over Chris barnes (sfu) , George "corpsegrinder"fisher (cc) ,and, Will rahmer (mortician), I mean those are the worse bands and all of those bands have horrible vocalists. If your a deathmetal purist? Then buy cryptopsy' "none so vile" because its a masterpiece.$LABEL$1
Really? People actually rated this 5 stars?. I rarely find a book that I dislike as much as this one. Clara was a pathetic, unfulfilled, horny character who gives romance writers a bad name and McClain was an arrogant jerk who was always being rude and insulting to her. Puff the cat was the highlight of the book and he shouldn't have even been in most of it because what idiot would kidnap a cat with their victim when they could leave it behind? I can't in good conscience recommend this book but judging by the ratings of other reviewers I am in the minority, so you might enjoy it more than I did.$LABEL$0

Classics won't scare you anymore. I just couldn't believe Emile Zola's genius when I heard that he wrote Therese Raquin on a newspaper manager's order of a detective novel.He simply read the newspapers for a clipping about murder and started writing it. What is surprising here is not how he started the novel but how he managed to make it a classic. It is a classic indeed, with an exception that I can offer it not only to "classics" readers but to any reader who is not conservative(for the book shows pure reality that is contrary to general taboos). It has everything that a classic should have: great use of language, a style(ie naturalism ), an insight to human feelings, mentality and conflicts, permanence through the years. What's more, it has everything that a bestseller should have,too: fascination, big events like murder, intrigues, love, hatred, sensuality. Perhaps you will find even more when you read the novel. It is everything one expects from a book.$LABEL$1
Stop kidding yourselves.... Look, Gnecco's voice is extraordinary--there's little doubt about that. But there isn't one decent song or original turn on this whole album. It's all forgettable overproduced noise, and its edge is completely dulled by its own indulgent and corporatized marketing 'package.' I kinda wish they just cranked out a low budget live thing instead of this Dreamworks-2-years-in-overdevelopement monstrosity.I saw this guy play in a coffeeshop in northern New Jersey--just him and a guitar--and he was pretty damn impressive. He should hire/collaborate with a guy who can write and produce a decent song and become very, very, famous.This album could and should have been a lot better.$LABEL$0

Bulky, but very useful. Until the recent release of low power CF wireless lan cards, this was your only option for going mobile with you iPaq Pocket PC. I've used the sleeve extensively with a Cisco Aironet 340 WLAN card and it works great. Want to go wide area? Slap in a Seirra Wireless Aircard and truely go mobile.While the sleeve is a bit bulky, the heft definately is out weighed by the usefulness. With new Pocket PC 2002 iPaq's (or the pending upgrade from Compaq for current owners), you can use VPN features while away from the office. The nice thing is Compaq seems very commited to the current form factor, meaning that even if you buy a new iPaq, the sleeve will still work for some time to come.$LABEL$1

Yuch!. I listened to the audiotape of this book. The reader did the best she could with the incredibly cornball dialogue and trite descriptions, but it was still barely tolerable.If I heard the words "Little Bear Lake" and "Robert Flaubert" one more time I would have screamed. Who told the author that constant repetition was a GOOD thing? Somehow she must have the idea that it is somehow romantic to constantly repeat names and places.Not only is the story trite and predictable, but the bigger than life protagonist and his idolicized dead father are annoying as hell. If Robbie was so perfect then why on earth did Maggie dump him? And the wize words that come out of 25-year-old Elliot's mouth are ludicrous. Quoting the Great Gatsby? How pretentious!Romance followers will still probably swoon over this pap, but literature lovers will barf.$LABEL$0
Big Dissapointment. I thought that this album was going to be the bomb but it totally ...! The only good song on the album is 'Heard it All Before'. There may be two other songs that grow on you but that is it. The lyrics are great but the rythms and melodies are skrewed. All the songs sound almost the same and her voice never really changes.... I think sunshine needs to collaborate with some other producers next album because this one bombed bad.$LABEL$0
I could have written this study guide myself. This study guide is horrible. While it serves as an adequate review of material that is covered up to the level of education prospective teachers are expected to accomplish,it is poorly edited and does not provide accurate details about the structure of the test. I would advise anyone preparing to take the Praxis II Spanish test to refrain from purchasing this study guide. The official study guide published by ETS is very good and can be used in combination with a good grammar guide and materials from your literature and culture courses.$LABEL$0
Junk. Nothing works properly on this gadget. The wireless function is a joke, the USB connection simply does not work and the printers that are incompatible is huge, Linksys will not even release a list.

Not What I Hoped For. I was so looking forward to these shoes, especially after reading all the wonderful reviews. They did arrive very quickly and I tried them on right away. The fit was fine, but I found the meshy fabric too be loose. I couldn't do alot of walking in them because I thought they would fly off. The fabric was very breathable and the arch and heal support was wonderful. Wished they would have worked, but I had to send them back.$LABEL$0
short lasting HDTV for over $200!. I had bought this item at SAM's Club in Sept. 2008. The TV started acting up near the end of April 2009. The TV ,when initially, turned on, would make a loud pop or a high pitch buzz and the screen would go black. After doing this 2-3 times back to back, the TV would warm up and finally work. I use this mainly as a TV, now I am using the screensaver on my computer to warm up the unit, so I can watch TV (Very inconvient). I am considering getting a 19" Vizio LCD. I only wished that I had read the reviews prior to my purchase. I am definantly staying away from ALL Phillips Magnavox products in the future FOREVER!$LABEL$0
Early-90s "dump" to CD needs RE-MASTERING!. There's a problem here. The Cars sold mega-platinum, especially Heartbeat City, which virtually defined the mid-1980s sound and look. So! Why is this CD a crude, early transfer with virtually no packaging?Seems the problem is, Elektra's out of business, or bought-out by a larger, more apathetic company. Also, could be the more "casual" Cars fans are tired of these Top Ten singles and MTV staples.Being ignored are we, the long-term, die-hard Cars fans who listen to EVERY album, EVERY summer ("it turns me upside-down / like a merry-go-round"). Whether this album is too commercial, or that other album too "arty" is NOT THE POINT. We deserve a quality reproduction of this ground-breaking album.Sadly, this current CD version is sonically INFERIOR to a clean cassette, or even vinyl on a good turntable. This. Is. WRONG.$LABEL$0
IT WORKS!!. Have tried no less than 10 "guaranteed to work" remedies for keeping deer fromeating my shrubs next to my house no doubt! Some worked better than others, but all of them had 1 thing in common. Reapplication after rain etc. This is as simple as hooking up to a garden hose and turning it on. Have seen no visible evidence ofdeer eating on (new or existing) growth since it has been in use. Approx 3 weeks!!*****ADDED BONUS****** My 5 year old grandaugher loves it too! She thinks it is a game of who she can fool into getting squirted.$LABEL$1

Good Working Picture of the Opening. This book offers advice for the practitioner of the Spanish. It is reasonably complete in the fact that it covers the opening from the point of view of black's responses.As you know the Spanish goes 1. e4-e5, 2. Nf3-Nc6 3. Bb5 ... It is here where the author starts. The book goes through all the major variations in some detail. (Often my computer will eventually diverge down some hidden lines of play which were overlooked by this book.) The only major drawback with this book is that the exchange variation is not covered in-depth.Overall, this is a good book and recomended for any player. (Also, if you are a beginner and are looking to study the openings, the Ruy Lopez and the Queen's Gambit are a good place to start.)$LABEL$1
I Fell Using This Bath Mat. These mats are very large and have a great thick rubber feel. But the "suction cups" on these mats can be problematic. The second time I used my mat, I moved to turn around in the shower and instead of the "suction cups" gripping the tub and keeping the mat in place, the mat suddenly slid down toward the drain. The thick rubber surface of the mat kept my feet in place, so my feet slid with the mat. I tried to catch myself, but it happened so fast that I couldn't. I fell very hard and landed squarely on my rump in the tub. I was sore for 3 days following this incident, but otherwise I was okay. This was a frightful experience and the one good thing that came of it was that I got to stop my 83 year old Mother from using the mat I had purchased for her. My Mother is very frail and had she slipped on the mat and fallen as hard as I did, I have no doubt that she'd have fractured bones.$LABEL$0
Great, Great, Great Book!. As always, Lynne Graham delivered a wonderful read. This book, as ALL her books, has GREAT: gorgeous billionaire hero, virginal heroine, memorable dialogue & scenes, romantic setting, wonderful chemistry between hero and heroine. I have read all her books, and they're all excellent. I eagerly await her newest release. If you enjoy reading romances that are pure escape, romantic, Cinderella-type romances, I highly recommend Lynne Graham.$LABEL$1
Bunch of self-righteous pussies.. Aaron Lewis needs to quit his bitching. I can't believe I wasted my money on this.$LABEL$0
Put your money towards something else. We have had nothing but trouble with this thing. Like other reviewers said the part that lifts up to empty the potty is not convenient. The latches on back to keep it together are very flimsy. The step stool only works when you take the potty apart and turn it upside down. The only time its convenient is if you are ready to move the seat to the adult toilet and use the step stool part as a step stool full time. But the worst part of this thing is the splash guard. My son never played with it. But once it was moved to the big toilet it would often come off and fall into the large toilet all on its own as my son was trying to get down. One day it fell off while I was taking him off the potty and I flushed before I realized it was in there. No, I didn't expect the chair to potty train my child for me but I certainly expected something that wouldn't fall apart.$LABEL$0

Should be in everyone's library!. I've been familiar with this liver flush from back in the days when it was just a little book-let. It was amazing back then and it's still amazing now. We spend so many years abusing our bodies with improper diets, eating chemicals and other toxic substances that our livers need a break! Your liver makes stones from all this abuse and this flush removes them safely, easily, and effectively. It's easy to do and requires very little monetary investment. Highly recommended!$LABEL$1
Perfect. After listening to this album for the gazillionth time the other night, it occurred to me that if I had to pick just one album to take to the grave this would be it. While I love much of VM's music, for me Astral Weeks is only approached by the almost-as-wonderful Veedon Fleece.I'm not going to write a lengthy review, many others have already done so much better than I could but I figured I should give perhaps the best album ever recorded a 5 star rating. So here it is.$LABEL$1
Much too long and boring. Like a text book. Gave up. I could not continue with this book any longer than 200 pages. Did'nt care what happened to the people. Found that I was speed reading just to get through it. This book is not for me. Can't give it away.$LABEL$0
Not the same as before.... Though the quality is not as great as the previous script books, Volume 3 of Season 2 does have some of the best scripts of the season!The book is slightly smaller than the previous 4, yet holds as many scripts. The pictures of the side and cover are smaller as well. Still, it holds the scripts that are the main point. Nice otherwise for any Buffy fan!$LABEL$1

Horrible Conversion!!!. I love this show. That said... the creators of this masterpiece should have the right to shoot whoever made these DVD prints. When the DVDs do actually play, they look like I made a copy with a pudding covered VHS tape. On some episodes I can almost see through Sam if he has on black. The black levels are horrible. The coloring is just plain off. Colorized versions of old Gilligan's Island look better than this. Also, I thought I could get past the music part, but OMG it just sucks. Next time let me record some Casio songs and throw them in there... it'd be better! The music was such a part of the show.. I feel ripped off in every way buying this. Seasons 3-5. Season one played fines and had the music.$LABEL$0

Teach ANYTHING to anyone?! I don't think so!. These books have the most misleading titles! Unless you are teaching Sunday school bible classes, this book is mostly useless, because the only examples it gives you are about how to better teach the bible. The title says 'teach almost anything to pratically anyone'. That is so NOT TRUE. Sure, it gives you some pointers, but I feel I have to squeeze the text really hard to get some juice.I bought this book and 'Almost Every Answer for Practically Any Teacher' hoping to learn how to teach better, and to get in touch with modern teaching skills. What a disappointment and a waste of money! The other book went straight to the garbage can.Another thing: if all the examples of bible teaching were stripped out of the book, it would be half the size and, perhaps, a much more pleasurable read. Maybe it would even earn another star!$LABEL$0
Linspire? Use Ubuntu instead.. Linspire takes a free (as in beer and as in speech) Linux distribution known as Debian, and then charges for the "service" of downloading software from a repository that is about 1/7th the size of the Debian repositories.

Can't judge this book by its cover.... I was looking for a good "reference" book on VBScript that would cover each function, their methods, properties, etc. While this book does indeed contain this information, its only 100 of its 800 pages (in an non-indexed appendix). It tries to be a little bit of everything (COM, ASP, browser controls to name a few), but doesn't excel at any of its topics. For example, there is a 16 page chapter on using COM components in MTS (this is supposed to be a Visual Basic Script reference guide remember!) This is a topic that can't even be introduced in 16 pages.The book almost seems like outtakes from books that never quite made it to print.If you're looking for a good VB script reference, this isn't it.$LABEL$0
Don't buy this!!!!. I have a Cuisinart coffee maker, model DCC-1100. This filter was supposed to fit, but it does not. And the handle came off instantly. I could use it without the handle if the filter fit, but, to repeat, it does not fit!$LABEL$0
What a disappointment. After listening to and loving River Runs Red, I went out and bought their next album, Ugly. Turns out Ugly is lame in comparison.

Not that I have anything against Cher, but she just doesn't fit in the metal scene.$LABEL$0
So Outdated Dont waste your money!. This book was written in 1988, and refers to the mass suicide in James Town as "a few years ago." This book is completely outdated and truly truly for people who have ZERO self esteem. I admit I have my issues hence why i purchased this but even I couldn't finish, let alone really start this book. I spent a half hour attempting to read the beginning and skimmed for another 1/2 (see? I tried) I'm 21 years old and its completely irrelevant to these times, the way my generation thinks and behaves. My advice, leave this one alone unless your a pathetic wallowing mess who wants to read examples of other wallowing pathetic messes ( example: Robert R. "I hate my life because my gf left me." Susan Q. "My work makes me feel worthless" etc etc) No real advice just a bunch of bull. Whatever it takes to sell books I guess.$LABEL$0

Excellent saw.. I bought this saw with some reservation to replace my existing Porter Cable 347's. Those saws were my favorite and I could no longer find them anywhere. I was pleasantly suprised that the saws power and design did not let me down. It appeared bulky from the pictures but the actual saw gaurds and the such are not intrusive like I thought they would have been.The basics are the same as the trusty 347. Nice substantial magnesium base, light weight, lots of power etc., but the subtle improvements (angled cut to the base, built-in sawdust deflector, rubber handle, to name a few) are very nice, making this saw a joy to use.Enjoy.$LABEL$1

NETWORKED TV. Well, it isn't HDTV but it works and works well! You can see clearly once it is set up properly. The system installed easily and worked out of the box with no problems. The software was a bit sparce but it worked. I use it to take pictures of patients and the quality is good. Hey, it's no Mona Lisa but at least I can see which Mrs Jones is here today!Buy it. It is good value for money.$LABEL$1
Fraud. This guy is a fake. The book is ok. The author has no business writing about this topic. After purchasing a $39 ebook from his that did not deliver on the promise, I tried to get a refund and couldn't. I did some research on him and it turns out he has NO experience as a marketer. He's a general writer who's sold a lot of articles. He has NO business talking about "empire building" or "nich marketing". Besides the fact that he is extremely unprofessional in his business dealings.$LABEL$0
One of the best coaches active today. Nick Saban relives his coaching through the LSU years. The major disappointment here is that Alabama is mentioned and pictured on the front cover, but there is not one word written inside the two covers about Alabama. My interest transferred to Alabama when Bear Bryant went there in the mid-to-late 50's. Good book on self improvements more than football.$LABEL$1
Don't waste your money !!. I bought this game at Best Buy, and was told it was "just as good as Sony but cheaper cuz the Sony name wasn't on it". As soon as I got, it home and opened it, I found out why it's cheaper: 1. gotta load the software every time (yeah right, that's a great feature !!) 2. Cartridge got stuck in the game deck 3. Saves unbelievable and excruciatingly slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww !! This piece of "hardware" isn't worth the plastic packing it came in. What a complete WASTE !! Time to try and get my money back.$LABEL$0
like design and product but not color. the product is great. i prefer it over other popular drugstore eyebrow pencils that are similar. i like how thin the liner is. and how it twists instead of having to sharpen. and the brow brush on the end is so practical. however i only gave this 4 stars because the color is kind of dark. I have dark blonde hair with highlights and my eyebrows are more like a light brown and this color is at least as dark as my eyebrows if not more. not sure how the other colors compare but i like this product enough to try to find it in blonde, instead of just dark blonde.$LABEL$1
Excellent book for even reluctant readers!. I loved "Belle Prater's Boy" from the moment I began reading it, and my love only deepened when I began teaching the book to my 6th grade students. The children were immediately fascinated with the many mysteries in the book, such as the sudden disappearance of Belle Prater, the mysterious circumstances of Amos' death, and why Gypsy has strange, violent nightmares. The author skillfully reveals clues steadily throughout the book, causing readers to keep reading until their teacher forces them to put the book down. :-) My students loved examining the clues and playing detective to determine how the pieces fit together, as well as discussing the themes of forgiveness and how appearances can be deceiving. "Belle Prater's Boy" proved to be an excellent book for my 6th graders, many of whom are reluctant and/or struggling readers. I give it my highest recommendation for children's literature!$LABEL$1
Interesting Beef Jerky. This brand of jerky has its own different, distinck flavor compared to other brands. It's quite a good flavor, I would call it interesting as it tastes different than most jerky's out there. The consistency is good, it has a nice texture, chewy and a bit juicy. It's not the best out there but it is very good in its own way. It has a bit of a sausage taste to it, kind of like a slim jim but you can barely notice it. Also, it is a bit salty. There is nothing out of the ordinary in the ingredients list.This is a good choice if you want a high protein, low calorie, low fat, and low carb snack on the go.$LABEL$1
Hectically paced, poorly executed. Hermann Scherchen belongs with Jascha Horenstein in that quirky category of great conductors who recorded with such poor orchestras that it's often hard to listen to the results. Considering how truly terrible the Vienna Symphon(Pro Musica) was in the Westminster era, you have to tiptoe carefully indeed to avoid some real train wrecks. Even the Vienna Staatsoper orchestra, which is supposed to be composed of members of the Vienna Philharmonic, was veyr raggedy in those days. This is a breakneck Eroica performed without much technical finesse, yet among Scherhcen's Beethoven readings, it is typical in both respects.$LABEL$0

A worthwhile read, but not for the mystery.... While I agree for the most part with the more prestigious reviews already posted, in the end, this book falls flat. Unsworth impressively whisks the reader back to medieval England, presenting characters who are sympathetic to a 20th century audience, and the story progresses in an interesting and thoughtful way. However, the final answer to the whodunit is much less impressive than the portrayal of the acting process, especially the interactions and improvisations that are part of every stage production$LABEL$1

He STILL does not explain!. Martyn Gregory STILL does not explain why the following happened!1. Why was a partial embalming done on Princess Diana while she lay in the French hospital.2. Why did street cleaners come into the tunnel just a few hours after the accident to clean the street where the accident was.3. Why did they reopen the tunnel just hours after the accident.4. Why was Henri Paul's blood packed with carbon monoxide.5. Why wouldn't anyone let Henri Paul's family do an independent study on Henri Paul's blood6. Why were witnesses that saw certain things eliminated from the investigation. And on and on and on. In my mind, Princess Diana was 'eliminated' by top professionals....and they got away with it. Read 'The Hidden Evidence and 'The Murder of Princess Diana'!$LABEL$0
Stunning. Lyric, unsentimental... moving... Kleinzahler demonstrates tremendous virtuoso as a poet, integrating the language of the city and the language of the heart into his work.One of the very few contemporary poets today with a lyrical ear and a vision for a poetry that challenges what he calls the "professional neuroticism" of the neo-confessional poem and the vacant opacity of avant-garde poetics.These poems hit close to home. They are engaged in the city with all of its energy, loneliness, and paradoxes.$LABEL$1
A disappointed little girl..... Why in the world would they still be selling software that only runs on a 16-bit architecture? At least, they should make an upgrade available.

thought it would be better. Everything that volume five was, this one wasn't. It had some mediocre tunes, but nothing that approached the flow and catchyness it's predecessor had. I tried to like it and if I hadn't listened to the previous ones, I might have liked it. That is the problems when you get compilations, the listener is subject tothe whims of the compilers and there are no guarantees. In the big picture there are no guarantees either and I'll take my lumps.$LABEL$0
Busted and empty pills in bottle. I have been buying NOW products for a while because I used to feel like their quality standards were very high compared to other manufacturers. When I received this product several capsules had leaked into my entire bottle covering the pills in the awful taste of raw supplements. Additionally some just appeared to have been blank from the factory. As far as effectiveness of this supplement, it is too early to tell. At this point I will probably be switching manufacturers should I buy more.$LABEL$0

Defective card. I have always used sandisk CF cards. I bought this for my new Canon 40D and right away I started to see that one out of every 100 images was corrupted. First I thought it was the new camera but soon the camera started to freeze on me when in continuous shooting mode. I thought I might have a bad copy of the 40D! Did some research and found that the same issue was faced by others and the issue was the card and not the camera. I replaced it with an EXTREME III 4GB card and i have not seen the problem since even in continuous shooting mode. I'd recommend sticking with EXTREME III series for now!$LABEL$0
Not a nickel would I spend.... If sales of this CD featuring "various artists" help Stan's widow and family, so be it; but I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone to whom this music really means something.I had to listen to one of my old Stan Rogers albums to hear the real thing and get this pale imitation out of my system.$LABEL$0

Dissapointing. A Steven Spielberg sci fi film starring Tom Cruise can create a lot of hype and expectations and unfortunately this film fails to live up to them. The film's first twenty minutes are compelling but once Cruise has to go on the run the film falls apart. The action scenes in this movie are laughable and their is far too much CGI. The process of how the precogs determine the future is not explained well enough either. Spielberg last great film was Jurassic Park and he has been slipping ever since, by focusing too much on effects and not on relatable charachters or compelling story.$LABEL$0
Does what it's supposed to do.... I was in a bandaged split on my right foot and halfway up my leg after my Achilles tendon surgery. I used the waterproof medical tape for a few weeks whenever I needed to wrap white plastic trash bags around my foot and leg before showering. The tape held well without being too sticky and painful when it needed to be pulled off. I used two trash bags and "double wrapped" for better water resistance. You have to do a good job because water will find it's way in if you don't. The bag and tape ritual was a royal hassle for a few weeks but the tape did what it was supposed to do.$LABEL$1

There is no low speed!. We just turned our red Dualit mixer on for the first time. The mixer is designed with 5 speed settings. The very first speed - the "blend" setting - sent our mix spewing across the kitchen. Racy is indeed a correct term.

Sadly, we're packaging and returning this mixer, and then washing the ingredients off the cabinets.$LABEL$0
Excellent Album By One Of The Best Blues Guitarists Around. Jimmy Thackery is one of the best blues guitarists around. His talents should make him known to a far wider audience than he seems to have but such are the unfortunate realities in the lives of musicians. Thackery is one of those guys whose name should be instantly recognized among blues fans, but whose name is not that well known. Too bad.This is one of Thackery's first releases and it's an excellent album. If you like blues guitar, then this album is well worth your attention.If you like artists like Stevie Ray Vaughn, you'll like this Thackery release.$LABEL$1

Truly illiterate and truly fatuous.. I am 55 years old and have a master's in journalism. I am a professional copy editor. When I read this book I became so frustrated I came close several times to throwing it away.This book had to have been published without an editor. About every third sentence in the entire text is not a sentence with a subject and verb -- instead what you get is a clause, dangling by itself, with a period at the end.Also, the author must have sat down before he wrote this manuscript and compiled a list of every obscure word he could find in the dictionary -- or worse, German publications from the 1920s and 1930s -- and made sure he used every last one.If I knew a way to ask for my money back I certainly would do so.This book is a nightmare.$LABEL$0

Tedious and uninspiring. This was a BAD movie. Not only was it boring, it also gave you no emotional connection to its characters. The main revelation seems to be that, (NEWS FLASH!) women think about sex, too. I was especially saddened that the conclusions the couple reached after their mutual mistakes were that 1) the word "forever" made the wife nervous and 2) they needed to go home right away and ...s. And this in the midst of a crowded department store while taking their young daughter Christmas shopping. Wow! That's romantic! Talk about the love of a lifetime! I'm sorry that Tom and Nicole wasted so much time and effort for so little reward.$LABEL$0

Let's get back to our roots!. The battle for everything is a wonderfully musical album that really goes back to the roots of a true artist. John more or less is Five For Fighting and his passion for music really shines through. Similar to America Town, there are classic guitar sounds combined with beautiful piano melodies. One Hundread Years, the single from this album, is the type of song that makes you think, laugh and cry. Disneyland just puts a smile on my face and reminds me of many summers at Disneyworld. NYC weather report really shows urban flare to it, and just is a wonderful song. I had very high expecations after America Town for this album, and John delivered 1,000 fold. If you don't have this album get it now, cause it is the type of album that you can listen to over and over again!$LABEL$1
Nothing New. I heard some of this album and it is definitely nothing new. What Limp Bizkit is doing has been done before, and much better. If you enjoy the rap/rock/metal of Limp Bizkit, then listen to Rage Against the Machine because their music is much more passionate and meaningful than anything Limp Bizkit has released up to now. "Three Dollar Bill, Y'all" was a step in the right direction for this band, but "Significant Other" is not in my opinion.$LABEL$0
The most fun in SF. Stephenson is one of the 3 best cyberpunk authors, one of the 10 best SF authors, and certainly one of the 100 best authors alive (how's that for random?) This may not be his best book, but is the most fun, and not to be missed. If you are new to Stephenson, promise yourself to give it 50 pages. If you do, you'll read everything he has written. Do it in this order: Snow Crash, Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon. After that, you're on your own, because you are truly hooked.$LABEL$1

Very bad quality sofa. Yes, indeed, the sofa looked great on the picture for me too, in addition to that the reviews were just excellent, though, I suspect the were written by request of the company's owner. The sofa proved to be of a bad quality, awfully inconvenient and doesn't have much of space as a sofa compared to other ones. As one of the reviewers noted the useless pillows slide off, the sofa has a bar in the middle once it turns into bed and I have backaches all the time after I sleep on it. I did not have much of a choice a year ago when I moved into a new apartment, and it seemed to be as a good idea to buy this bed from the Internet. I doubt I will ever be purchasing furniture online after this terrible experience!$LABEL$0
Very Leaky!!!. We bought this tent as a first timer camper for our family. We liked the size and that it had 3 rooms. We were very excited to have a tent of our own as we had borrowed them in the past. The first time we used it everything went well. Set up was quick and easy and it didn't rain. Then next trip it rained and when we found out it was leaking everyhing was soaked soo bad that we had to pack up and go home. We were very disappointed so we returned the tent to the store for a refund. Since we have not bought another tent as we are afraid of the same thing happening. I don't understand how other reviewers can say that this tent did not leak at all?????$LABEL$0
poker tabletop. This tabletop was what I expected. It arrived in good condition, on time as promised. I used it for a home game on top of 2 card tables. It worked perfectly. The cup holders are shallow and 2 people spilled drinks on it. For the money it is worth it.$LABEL$1
For those that enjoy military SF.... While the author's style adds little to push the edge of the envelope in SciFi it is, when action is presented, a fast paced exciting read. This helps to cover the logic inconsistencies that pop-up from time to time. His character development leans too heavily on sterotypes, but that doesn't get in the way of the story line. One petty observation, my First Edition had far too many typos, errors and word ommissions, which I hope will be corrected in future editions. I make enough of these myself...$LABEL$1
A prayer to the DVD gods. Among many others, I, too, remain bewildered by the absence on DVD format of this brilliantly hillarious film. All the performances mentioned in these Amazon reviews were terrific; I just want to add Wilfred Lawson's butler Peacock for special mention.$LABEL$1
Too messy!. I bought Harrah my large dog some of this 2 years ago, and of course it smells SO GOOD, but it is just too messy.Most of the "bar" has been turned into powder from it being so brittle. So you get maybe 1/4 of the "ice cream bar" intact while the rest just sits on the bottom.I do not mind my Harrah having fun while eating a treat but even she was turned off trying to figure out where the "powder" went. (Since its freeze dried, unless you get a sizeable chunk the minute the powder is wettened by her nose or tongue its "melted") This just confused her and she ended up leaving the powder and small pieces alone.But if youre lucky and can get a pretty entact bar, I'd say give it a try. She seemed to like the sweetness.$LABEL$0
Totally 70s. This is the sequel to the classic 1996 hit that parodied the cliches of slasher horror films. A typical updated slasher film, yet the brilliance lies in parodying that which it is, a chessey slasher film on a low budget. David Arqutte is a Clive Barker look alike. I gave it two stars because my tastes have changed since I was the geek rooting on the killer. At one dollar, you can't go wrong for cheap slasher flicks, except it lacks the drive in aura of Halloween or even the classic icons of Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. As a straight slasher film series, this would be great, instead it's poking fun at the slasher film cliches. A joke it is.$LABEL$0
$96? Are you kidding???. I think there must be an error in the decimal point in the price. A box of refills shouldn't cost more than about $10 at target.$LABEL$0
very interesting book, but...... This is a very readable and useful book, I appreciate it. However, almost of all people in the book are the westerners with few exception ;( Mishima Yukio and Hafez ). Therefore, you cannot find famous Arabian, Persian, Turkish, Indian, Chinese, Japanese gay & lesbian people. And in the book, there do not exist important figures like Platon, Epameinondas, Harmodios and Aristogeiton et al. In addition , even Jean Cocteau, Ludwig 2nd , Truman Capote, Somerset Maugham, and Luchino Visconti also are absent.$LABEL$1

Don't Bother. I can't believe that Sidney Sheldon wrote this novel. I have read all of his novels, and enjoyed them, but I found myself skimming this one after I was only halfway done. The dialogue between the characters was lame and unbelievable. The story was choppy and didn't flow at all. I was thankful I borrowed this book from the library!I found it very disappointing.$LABEL$0

Convoluted plot. This is an extremely convoluted novel. There are multiple subplots which seem disconnected but then at the end are coincidentally brought together (maybe??). You spend half your time trying to figure out who's who. Maybe it's time for Cornwell to go back to "plot" school.$LABEL$0
sympathy for women over 50.... felt so bad that these wonderful beautiful talented actors had to resort to such drivel to make a sawbuck... at least Joan looked normal and aged well, Bette having to out ghoul the ghouls to illicit some scare tactics and rats n tweety bird for dinner just took the cake, and that dang song would not leave my head about that DaDDY!!! whose address is heaven above, well I wish that is were this film would go, the ending on the beach was unexpected but that ice cream looked good and back then they made it with the good stuff... Bette's daughter is abs gorgeous and expected to see more of her but after she witnessed this death march would expect she would steer clear, oh well, maybe a remake with Angelina Jolie and Jenn Aniston in 2025 is something to look forward to!! ;}}$LABEL$0

Boring!!!!!!. I have been a Stephen King fan for years and loved his earlier books. This one is a disaster. I kept trying to read it but finally gave up. I think he has lost his ability to write great books such as The Stand, Carrie, Pet Sematary, Salem's Lot and other earlier books. Luckily I got this book as part of an introductory offer for membership in a book club. I'm glad I didn't spend much money on it.$LABEL$0
Classic?. Seems most like to refer to "Heartbreaker" as his masterpiece, and while I tend to like "Love Is Hell" and "Cold Roses" a hair more, this is in my top three. Being his first solo album after he ended Whiskeytown, this naturally sounds like that band more than his later albums do. It's all alt-country here. After the intro track, this starts out rocking with "To Be Young (is to be sad, is to be high), then quickly mellows for most of the rest. Many of these are what I consider to be quality sad songs, if not lyrically, then musically. The first half of "Heartbreaker" I find the strongest, and a few songs are really slow, but the whole thing holds up well. There's no doubt this guy can write a good song. Again, this might not be the first Ryan Adams album I reach for, but It'll always remain in my vinyl collection.$LABEL$1
First Rate Production is a MUST for Serling Fans. This is an excellent biographical documentary about the life and works of Rod Serling. It is brilliantly constructed and edited. This well crafted presentation is a first rate production all around. Rod Serling was a man of great literary and social intellect, somewhat ignored because of the genre he worked within and was famous for. His endearing legacy, "The Twilight Zone" frequently bordered on the edges of science fiction if not immersed in it. Society's values being what they are, science fiction has never been thoroughly embraced by conventional thought as a legitimate literary or cinematic art form until very recently. That is society's loss and Serling's heartbreak. I originally saw this documentary on Public Television and was pleased to find it issued on VHS. Highly recommended!$LABEL$1

Funny, but it didn't make me feel any better about my weight!. Camryn Manheim is an sassy, award-winning actress and laugh-out-loud funny. This book is a personal account of her experiences of fat-ism and her journey to self-acceptance.Manheim is a natural storyteller and, being overweight myself, there was a lot here to relate to, but although I enjoyed the book, there were no groundbreaking revelations for me here ... though it does make a pretty strong case against society's obsession with being thin, this book is in no way a "self-help" book (to be fair, it doesn't claim to be) and it didn't help me to "make peace" with my fat. It did however make me laugh a lot and that's reason enough to encourage others to read it!Thank you Camryn, for speaking out for big women everywhere.$LABEL$1
Don't Waste your Money. Pros- cheapCons- There is just no other way to put it. This is crap. You have to constantly fix the string, unplug turn it upside down take off the cap (and this is not easy, I am 62 and have small hands and can't reach and use the pressure needed to remove.

Bert and Fritz together at last!. This is a relatively straightforward propaganda melodrama, with nothingparticularly compelling to recommend it, but for one notable exception.Bertold Brecht's villains and miscreants are all so full of gusto. They share kinship with the ones in Threepenny Opera and Mahagonny after all. It seems Brecht could not create a scoundrel he couldn't admire on a certain, mischievous level. The ones in this film are no exception, and lift it out of the "ordinary" into the realm of the "oddity".$LABEL$0
There are errors in this book!. I just took my exam yesterday and attended a week long seminar to prepare.

That book also includes a CD with practice exams.Even though I took the test yesterday, I just ordered the Shon Harris book for my reference.

Great show, defective dvds. I absolutly love Doctor Who, and think it's a great show, but when I bought this set, I recieved defective dvds, which I then returned only to recieve another set of defective dvds, and now I'm still waiting on a refund. Therefore, you may want to consider buying this on iTunes, unless you really want the special features and the Christmas episode, which is not currently on iTunes. Either way, I would recomend buying it from somewhere, it's fantastic.$LABEL$0
Amazon.com waffles. Amazon.com's suspension of its normal rules and policies for this one title boggles the mind, but it does reveal a clear demonstration of bias.

I thought he was going to sing. We bought this album as my mother is a huge fan of Regis and we always buy two Christmas albums a year. What a disappointment. Regis doesn't so much sing as talk along to the background music. His wife's voice on Baby its cold outside is great - compared to him. This will be one of those CDs that go in a drawer and never see the light of day again.$LABEL$0

A bit pricey, but they make you look good. We recently held a luncheon for 150 industry guests. I put a light-yellow background and logo on these, then printed everybody's first name real big in dark blue. Underneath was their last name and company name. The badges looked fantastic.The price is a bit expensive for stickers, but the adhesive sticks sell to clothing and comes off easily. Overall I'm real happy.$LABEL$1
Only for Mandy Fans!. I love Mandy Moore and was very excited to get this soundtrack. It was certainly worth it. Each Mandy song is gorgeous and she sounds lovely. Cry was the best song on her latest CD and probably one of the prettiest ballads I've heard. Only Hope is another romantic ballad that suits her perfectly and she sounds better that ever. Its Gonna Be Love is a mid tempo track that is sweet and catchy. The other tracks by the other artists are not as great. Fans of Mandy Moore are certainly not fans of the type of music the other songs are except for If You Believe by christian pop singer Racael Lampa. An uplifting ballad that showcases her amazing voice. The other songs by Toploader and Switchfoot are very slow, boring, and not very interesting. As I said, this is a must for Mandy Moore fans, she is at her best.$LABEL$1
danger, will robinson. If you are looking for a wrestling game that is fun and involving, don't buy this one.

flimsy mount. Got this telescope for hubby's Christmas. Flimsy mount, difficult to align, eye piece too loose for focusing. Worse, he's owned it only seven weeks and one leg failed, collapsed onto backyard concrete patio. Now we're having problems with customer service at Celestron, not promising replacement telescope with new warranty (for what the warranty is worth). Before you buy, remember that if you need to return the telescope, YOU pay shipping both ways. Disappointed with the brand.$LABEL$0

Amy's best pop music album. This is Amy Grant's best pop album. There are the hits we all know about such as Baby Baby, Every Heartbeat, Good For Me, That's What Love Is For, and I Will Remember You. But she also does well with the fun songs Galileo and Hats. Ask Me is an incredibley poignant song about sexual abuse. And You're Not Alone and How Can We See That Far are relationship ballads.Is this album "Christian" or "Pop"? The answer is it is a pop album that clearly has a Christian base - many references, some obvious (Hope Set High) and some not so obvious (Every Heartbeat) point to her faith in God.Top to bottom, one of the best all around pop albums if the early 1990s.$LABEL$1
Cheap. Bought this a couple of years ago for my son (age 5 at the time). It's heavy and cheaply made. When he was actually ready for lessons, the instructor couldn't get it to tune correctly. I am not a guitar player, so I cannot describe what was wrong, but something about the bridge and neck that would need some work in order to get it in playing shape. I wound up buying a Fender starter that was more, but so far worth it....$LABEL$0

Disappointing. If it were any other band, I'd probably rate this higher, but my boys just took a bad turn. I don't know what Chris was thinking when he wrote these lyrics. How he went from the poetic "Girl From a Pawnshop" off of Three Snakes to "Heavy" and "Kickin' My Heart Around" is beyond me. He used to write the best words. Also, the album has too much noise; if they've completely changed their style, I don't like it. Hopefully, they were just trying to get their name known again, and they'll go back to their good stuff from now on.$LABEL$0

Not what I expected from Calphalon. I've gotten fabulous bargains on Calphalon at Amazon before - top quality stuff at great prices. So I thought I was getting the same with this pan. Not so. The non-stick coating is fine, but the pan seems cheaply made because of the handle. It's not a nice, heavy, cast handle like I usually get, but made of some sort of lightweight metal that I'd expect to find on a cheap grocery-store pan. The edges on the handle aren't even smooth.$LABEL$0
Not worth it. I had this thermostat in my home for 3 years. It mysteriously failed for 3 days last year (no AC) and then suddenly worked right before the AC repair man could arrive. It worked another year and experienced same issue but never regained consciousness. It would not keep the numerically selected setting. I could actually stand there and watch it climb or drop over 10 degrees in a matter of seconds, which in turn would immediately shut off either my heat or AC, whichever. Backup batteries were not related to this issue. Owners manual had no customer service hot line number for me to call (another nice touch, very professional). It now adorns the local landfill. Try a Rite Temp touch-pad at half the price.$LABEL$0
Relaxation & Meditation. Most people who are serious about meditating yearn for a combination of sounds that harmonize with music. I like many types of sounds, rain, ocean waves, tranquil melodies.I am sorry, Hans Peter Neuber presents to many instrumental pieces. It is hard to meditate when once into a nice mood an electronic oboe or electronic piano comes blairing to the forefront. I wish Hans would have not put so many different instruments into the composition. It is a nice driving CD but is not conducive to meditating deeply.This CD needs more natural sounds and less electronic sounds.$LABEL$0

Flat and dissapointing. Although Sawyer writes competently I gave it 2 stars for failure to live up to possibilities. Two humanoid societies interact after 40,000 or so years of separate development with differing histories, cultures, values, etc. What happens? We obsess about the characters and love lives of Mary (the human) and the Neantherthal (whatsisnameagain, he looks like Arnold without the chin), a couple of boring representatives of their species. "Harlequin" as another reviewer labeled it, sounds right.I think Sawyer's desire that things turn out right prevents a sense of danger or conflict that might make things work. I kept waiting for the Pentagon to start war-gaming the possibilities (you could send an army over in New Mexico and have it pop up in Beijing for instance), for the Neanderthal vs Human championship(Neanderthals win), but all I got is this unrealistic plot and goody-goody philosophy.Oh well, back to the Martian Chronicles, Dune, whatever.$LABEL$0
Really nice blend of fast and slow titles. A REALLY nice addition to any collection and if you like this type of music, by all means GET THIS!The only reason it is not a 5 is because I "ruined" myself by listening to his best of CD too much! :) If you have "best of" then by all means get this, if you don't - get that CD, see if you like his style - THEN get this one!The first two songs are what it is all about:Birdsong is a fast flirty ride - just like a bird flying - you can almost feel it! while "Distant thunder" is the perfect blend of styles - very slow and sweeping that makes him perfect to listen to!I would say this is a worthy addition to your collection.Jim$LABEL$1
What was he thinking?. Presents the Analects "in authentic I Ching order," an absurd decision which just means that any given passage is practically impossible to find.

Surreal Adventure. Each time another Atlantis game is released, the version becomes more surreal than the last.

Sweet Mountable Laser. I put this on my airsoft gun and the first game i played with it i pointed at my friend who was on the other team, he hid behind cover and said "Well thats intimidating." Otherwise its a pretty sweet laser, i put it on my sniper so its easier to no scope at close range if i have to. Ive had it for a while and use it a lot and the batteries are still doing good. I had to put tape around it so it would fit more snug in the rail mount. to adjust it you just spin the front of it and i taped that after it was adjusted so it wouldnt move.$LABEL$1

Super series for media & film studies (16-19 year olds). I am biased, as I'm the Series Editor, but every title in the series has lots of factual and conceptual background information for each topic, two sample six-week teaching schemes and teaching tips (and downloadable photocopiable worksheets and web notes from [...]) as well as 3-5 detailed case studies, full glossary and suggestions for further research.Every writer is an experienced teacher and/or examiner and most titles (with the exception of ones with 'British' in the title) have a fairly international perspective.More titles on the way...$LABEL$1

Bathtime fun!. I like this toy for my toddler son. We work on concepts "in" and "out" with the bugs in the net while he is in the bath. One thing I will note is that the toy we got has a pink net and a lot of pink in it. (Different than the current picture.) We don't mind but I probably wouldn't feel comfortable giving it as a gift to a little boy who is not my own because some people would think it is a girl's toy with all the pink. He loves to squirt the buggies. For us, a 5-star buy.$LABEL$1

a one man wrecking crew. An Iranian terrorist wants to become a nuclear power, and steals the radioactive material and the scientist needed to build a bomb. Only Nick Carter, American superhero can stop him. Will he? Of course, but as expected by the title, lots of dead bodies litter the streets of the Middle East before its over. This book is written for readers of Soldiers of Fortune who think the NRA is perhaps a little too left wing. Keep in mind it's basically a comic book, and you may enjoy the fast paced action. It's stocked full of gory detail and women who swoon into Carter's arms, just like James Bond.$LABEL$0

Awful disappointment. I sorely disagree with the other reviews. this book was awful!!!!!!!! i love this type of book, but this particular one did nothing for me. it's insanely boring, dont bother!!! instead, do yourself a favor and pick up "killer heels" by sheryl j. anderson and "killer blonde" by laura levine.$LABEL$0
works GREAT for Poison Ivy!!!! Quick & Effective. I like the Boiron products and can depend on the company. The dispenser makes despensing the remedy very easy.

People's, I Love You!. There have been {So Called} One Hit Wonder artist's that I thought were extremely underrated and they had Stunning Hits and one of those artist's is the band, People!. Their late 60s version of the song, I Love You, is worth the price of admission by itself plus they had other good songs too. I finally found myself an alternate Disc of People! with this song on it (it's the, Long Album Version, and I love it) and it's called "Best of People! Vol 1 - 40 Year Anniversary" but because of it's originality; I would have liked to have owned this Disc. I have asked myself many times; why is this, People;I love You, CD OOP when there are so many other One Hit Wonder Artist's CD's in print PLUS I couldn't find this song on a various artist's CD either. Is it because this material has been forgotten by everyone except for the reviewers on this Disc?.....Maybe.....But that song is a step above many others (One Hit Wonders or not).$LABEL$1
Brodeur scared the public about a non-existent risk. Brodeur is a powerful writer, and his book launched a series of investigations of possible effects of magnetic fields from power lines. In the last couple of years, the verdict is in: power lines do not have a detectable health effect. Brodeur was wrong. Brodeur caused authorities in several countries to waste enormous amounts of money: estimates range from hundreds of millions of dollars to the billions. He's a scaremonger. John W.

This is the beginning of Chaos. This is the very first book about Chaos I've ever read. And it was the right one: Now, my Master degree thesis is about nonlinear dynamics.Everybody can read this book and rapidly enjoy this new way to see the world. The beauty of the book doesn't reside on the highly technified material it covers, it resides on the passion that Gleick reflects when he describes this journey into discovery. This book is the milestone to the beginning of a self-directed search for knowledge and sense in a complex but wonderful world.For those who already know about Chaos theory, fractals and nonlinearity, this book represents a great opportunity to remember that the mathematics can be beautiful and overwhelmingly common in the real world too.$LABEL$1

"Sunrise" remix- NOT worth it!. I LOVE Duran Duran, but I wish I had my money back for this import single. "What Happens Tomorrow" is an incredible song, but I bought this for the Eric Prydz Mix of "Sunrise," hoping to finally hear a club mix that actually included the vocals. (The first batch of remixes found on the "Sunrise" single all neglected to include Simon's full vocals.) Disappointed again! The beat to this version is great, but it is only 3 & a half minutes long & features only a few background vocals at the beginning. I guess there will never be a full-out vocal club mix available on CD. The closest thing I know of is the Jason Nevins Mix on the "Queer Eye" soundtrack.Bottom line: Someone needs to take lessons from bands like Erasure, who still put out singles with multiple remixes & non-album songs that are well worth the money. 13 bucks is just too much for an album version that I already have & a short, vocal-less club mix. Shame on Epic records & Duran Duran!$LABEL$0
KJV Parallel Bible Comentary. My wife is a new Christian and has trouble understanding the Bible at times. A friend loaned her a copy of this book and she fell in love with it.

Very buggy product. Confirming the other reviews on this product, the item is quite buggy. The product has very unreliable issues with the volume and when it is increased can keep going by itself to maximum or goes all the way to volume when decreased.I use this item when riding my motorcycle with my the ipod on under my helmet. So once I set the volume I'm ok. It's nice to have the pause when I stop next to one of my riding buddies and I don't have to dig out the ipod to pause it to hear what he is saying. That and the next/previous track buttons seem to work fine. Don't know why the volume is so buggy but for the cheap price I paid for it I can live with it. The unit straps real nice to my handle bar next to the grip.$LABEL$0

worked great.. for a few days.. Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, LightedIt worked fine. didnt' pull at all. Really cut the hair my other brand would simply pass over.and it was quieter by a bit, too.but.. after a few days of owning it, used it twice, it simply wont run with any battery I put in it.The problem then is return, refund, etc.. so I think I'll see if best buy carries the same model, just to save all thathassle.Very nice unit, but apparently, see other reviews, there are some dependability issues.$LABEL$1
what a mess. i am giving this a one star review because received damaged materials, i do not know if it happened in shipping or prior but 2 largest pieces, the top where you put the baby down and one side were delivered cracked. it is still usable and i am too pregnant and stresses enough already to have to deal with complaints and unscrewing parts we already put together, packaging everything and sending it back only to wait for it again, specially because of the circumstances i have, i need it done in couple of days.reading through some other reviews i see i am not the only one. this is not a $10 item or something it's easily shipped back and forth, and they sure do charge enough for shipping, so it should come to our homes in one piece and undamaged.i'm really disappointed and know i will NOT buy items like this through amazon again or online for that matter.i will be posting pictures of the damage too under customer photos once i download them!$LABEL$0

Hilarious...... Oh dear? This is for real???????. I thought "Redneck woman" was a hilarious camp send-up of Country & Western music until the truth dawned on me - that this Gretchen Wilson woman was for real.Being ingorant, illiterate, uncultured and narrow minded is not a sin - as long as one is endeavouring to do something about this situation. Celebrating ignorance is foolish.Dear Gretchen,Buy some books, do some reading. Travel and try to travel to some other countries. Listen to more music from other places and other times. Use the money you make from this CD to get yourself an education. I think you will be very embarrassed about this CD in the future. Sorry!$LABEL$0
No es Karaoke. This isn't Karaoke. No lyrics display. This is strictly music without a vocal track. The lyrics are included in the liner notes, in little tiny print. Of course, if that's what you're looking for, the music is nicely done, and sounds like Mana.Este CD no es Karaoke. La letra no sale en pantalla. Es tan solo la musica sin cantante.

BROKEN AFTER 15 MONTHS!. I BOUGHT THE EDGER TRIMMER ON APRIL 25TH 2009. THIS IS IT'S SECOND SEASON AND ALREADY TWO BATTERYS HAVE GONE BAD. SO I BOUGHT ONE NEW BATTERY FROM THEM TWO MONTHS AGO AND 12 SPOOLS OF CUTTING WIRE.TWO DAYS AGO IT STOPPED WORKING ALL TOGETHER.NOW I'M STUCK WITH A NEW BATTERY AND TWELVE SPOOLS OF WIRE THAT IS OF NO USE TO ME.I CANNOT HONESTLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OUT OF THE 15 MONTHS OR SO THAT I HAVE HAD IT I ONLY GOT TO USE IT ABOUT 35 TIMES. MY PROPERTY IS NOT THAT BIG AND THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS SHODDY CONSTRUCTION AND VERY LITTLE WARRANTY TO BACK IT UP.

Necessary. The Fruit of Your Pain by Laverne Hanes-Stevens, PH.D is a necessary tool for anyone who wants to mature in their Christian walk. First, it helps one to accept the fact that there "will" be -not "might" be - seasons of struggle and pain in our lives. But, as the book explains, we can do more than simply accept that fact, we can actually be fruitful and grow as a result of our struggles. The 31 Meditations for Growing Kingdom Fruit exercises at the end of the book are especially helpful because it helps you to actually "develop" the fruit in your life.$LABEL$1
Cute idea...cheap product.. This is just the product I was looking for as I searched the internet all month for the perfect toy for my car-loving 23 month old son. I was so excited to find this cute playmat. When I recieved it I was alittle worried about the durability, but my son loved it Christmas morning! It is now the day after Christmas and this morning I realized that the paperlike covering is peeling off of the mat, leaving white spots all over the cute town/road side of the playmat. It had not even been open for 24 hours. I am sad, because my son loves it, but the peeling stuff is a choking hazard so I had to put it up. The funny thing is, my son is young and has been very gentle with this mat. I wonder how fast it would have fallen apart if I had a 5 or 6 year old son!$LABEL$0
pendant.

It really does concern me so i will have to buy another one when i find it that i think is more sterdy that won't break as easy. don't expect anything huge!$LABEL$0

Prime Livgren material . . . Moving. . .thus its Prime Mover. Prime Mover is a rerecording/rerelease of an album previously released by Livgren's former band, AD. I have never listened to the original Prime Mover album, but if it was half the quality of this disk, it was great material.In his earlier AD material, Livgren's exuberance over his rebirth sometimes overpowered his work. Gone was much of the subtlety that characterized his best Kansas material. By the time Prime Mover was created, he gained that subtlety back and he's put together some really good material here.Stand outs include Children of the Shadows, and Wandering Spirit. The remake of Fair Exchange, Kansas tune, is first rate, as are the new songs, Incantos and Out of Opus.New Kind of Love, a new kind of song for Livgren is the only tune that rubs me wrong. Just not my style, thats all.Production, material, performance all first rate, pick Prime Mover II up!Questions regarding this review, email me.$LABEL$1

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR METAL MEATHEADZ. Most METAL people will probably say the SCORPIONS suck or that they are GAY and what have you. They only know the 80's material and unfortunately, the SCORPIONS probably do not play this kind of material anymore.ULI JON ROTH and his solo band is the only unit keeping this monumental music alive. Mere words will do this recording an injustice. The only thing I can say is that if you are a fan of RETRO 70's heavy rock, then you must seek this and LONESOME CROW by the SCORPIONS, for you would be truly missing out.$LABEL$1

Buyer Beware.... Got the router, and when it chooses to it work fine. Unfortunately, even after upgrading the firmware from the shipped version 1 to the current 4.1.x, the product still doesn't want to work.

Great for storing spices. I buy my spices in bulk, so they always come in plastic bags which are easy to lose track of in the cupboard. These work perfectly for storing them. Afordable and cute.

Impressive!!!. I had no prior knowledge of this movie other than seeing the dvd at Best Buy. I was able to rent a copy and was supremely pleased with the results. This is a high caliber action movie that was extremely gripping from start to finish with many surpises along the way. The pace was relentless with high octane action set pieces from start to finish. Not a lot of dialogue, but this is the type of movie that Hollywood is always trying to make and usually fails after blowing 100 million. You will not be disapointed!!!$LABEL$1
Not durable. I got the Jbuds to listen to mp3 while walking my dag at the park.

I thought I might have just gotten a defective on and was going to get another pair but read several reviews of the exact same problem happening.Frustrating and disappointing.$LABEL$0
Excellent book for Clinical Approach, good for basic facts. This book is divided into 2 parts: Part 1 deals with The Clinical Approach, and Part 2 deals with the Essential Background Information.The Clinical Approach is the best part and includes 10 chapters (CNS, Eyes, Limbs, Head & Neck, Abdomen, Respiratory system, CVS, Hematology, Diabetes, and Skin). It focuses on the physical examination, and on the symptomatology.The second part contains a summary of basic clinical facts about the diseases which you can read in any standard textbook. In addition, there're many important subjects which are not covered properly in this section (e.g. dermatology).This book is not intended to be a complete textbook, and I think it should be supplemented by further reading. The margins of the pages are large so that you can add your additional notes. It contains few diagrams (no photographic pictures) and many tables.$LABEL$1
An engrossing tale of an incredible man. This is a very informative educational mini-series that traces one of Shackleton's explorations to the Antarctic.

Good workout for intermediate to advanced. The hour long, in-studio session on this DVD is excellent -demanding but without crazy, circus-type stunts. It is comparable to the Sadie Nardini DVDs I've tried. The only drawback in my opinion is the monotone, sometimes mumbling instruction that at times gets drowned out by the music (perhaps recording the instruction separately would've helped). I found the additional sessions filmed throughout the city peculiar. They lack instruction and aren't filmed in a way that makes following along very easy. They are artfully edited and show off Tara's skill but these qualities are likely of secondary concern to most shopping for yoga DVDs. These are minor quibbles though and the hour long session alone makes this a worthy investment for anyone looking for a challenging yoga DVD that will leave you sweating.$LABEL$1
I want my Saturday night back!. If you are a pseudo-intellectual, this is your film. You will be wowed by the lack of plot, the paper-thin character development, and the bored, vacant expressions on the characters' faces, which you will no doubt ascribe to their deep understanding of the timeless misery of the human experience.But if you are like me and just want to enjoy a movie without hollow pretense, save your money. At least I rented this one!$LABEL$0
Hay Fever. I was not aware that this was a live stage play. It was hard to follow on the audio tape. This was not really a 'story' being told.

Very fast, Reliable CF Reader. This product is much too under-rated. I've used it many, many times with both my mac and my windows machine without a glitch. The data transfer rate is quite fast and reliable. The USB 2.0 interface makes transferring big amounts of files a breeze. It used to take my about 7 minutes for my camera to download 256Mb worth of pictures to my computer. With this reader, I do the same in about 40 seconds. For this price + some rebates you might find out there, you have a no-brainer here. Of course, the only caveat is that it only reads CompactFlash Cards, but if that's all you use, then it should not be a problem. Great Buy.$LABEL$1

Classic, yet contemporary - and surprisingly good!. Fans of 1960's era Europop chanteuse - Francoise Hardy - will find much to be surprised and delighted by with 'Tant de Belles Choses' a contemporary (2004) album that plays hallmark to all of Hardy's strengths and charms while managing to sound positively fresh, relevant and certain to appeal to the post-millennium iPod set with absolutely no previous exposure to Hardy's works.While some tracks retain the classic 60's era Chanson sound (À L'ombre De La Lune' - 'Soir De Gala' - 'Grand Hotel'), the majority of the album uses modern studio production and instrumentation (eg - 'Jardinier Bénévole' - 'Sur Quel Volcan?' - 'Un Air De Guitare') that will easily fool listeners if you tell them that these are tracks by such melodic, atmospheric artists such as Air or Ivy. 'Tant de Belles Choses' is incredibly moody and melodic. Perfect rainy day music to deliciously gloom over, yet fantastically sexy all the way through thanks to Hardy's vocal magic.$LABEL$1

An Incredible Waste. Josh Groban had such promise, with a tremendous voice with incredible range and a budding, strong presence. Then came "Live at the Greek." It saddens me greatly to see that Groban has sold out and is now paying for it with voice problems. They're notable from the very beginning of this concert DVD, where Groban sounds strained and nasal. There's no denying that Groban is a grown man in control of his career. He claims credit for this concert as a producer, writer, creator. Even if he didn't, he's getting paid mega wages for it. So I find it impossible to cut him any slack for such a poor performance. "Live at the Greek" is a waste of Groban's talent, and (I agree with other disappointed buyers), a complete waste of money! My advice? Get it at a used CD store. I'm sure the stores are full of them.$LABEL$0

Egyptian Goddeath. I was 100% disappointed by the aroma of Egyptian Goddess. I put it on and immediately wished I hadn't. It stayed on for 3 good days, and I showered each day. I have tried to give it away, but nobody wants it. Next week it will be making it's way to the great-grandmother, maybe she will like it. To sum it up very quickly: Do not buy this scent if you are under the age of 75; it smells like old lady, exactly. Pretty much the same reason I cannot give it away.I would give 1 star, but I don't want to trash the entire Auric Blends line. Their Patchouli blend is awesome and I love that. Not sure what happened with the Egyptian Goddess, but pee-yew! I'd like to try their other scents, but now I am not sure I should stray from the patchouli.$LABEL$0

A kids review. Where the red fern growsBy Wilson RawlsWhere the red fern grows is a story about a boy who honestly wants a dog, gets two honestly, and honestly deserves every prize he receives.He earned the money for his dogs working for two years straight, piercing his feet on thorns to get berries, doing every chore he can do, and finally, he earns the 50 dollars and buys his dogs.His dogs are Little Ann and Old Dan, the two inseparable forever. Where one goes, the other follows, they would fight together, play together, hunt together, sleep together and die together, If they have to.I was required to read this book, and I was very uneasy about the coon hunting, but after a while, you understand what it means to Billy. I also didn't think much of chopping down a tree days on end to get one coon...But, it serves the purpose of showing what trust there is between the three, a determination that will never yield....Though it might have a sad ending, the end still leads hope.$LABEL$1
What A Voice!!. Miki Howard deserves a better career than she has had, thus far. What a talent!! Her re-make of Aretha's "Till You Come Back To Me" is light-years better than the original. The test of a true talent & good voice is how it handles time. Aretha Franklin can't sing to save her life now. She has abused her body & voice with up-and-down obesity & smoking, such that she just cannot do it anymore, physically. Plus, she's embarrassing to look at, she is so overweight. Miki's talent & voice have handled the passage of time incredibly intact, flawless. I pray she keeps recording!! God bless you, Miki!!$LABEL$1
My daughters' favorite book of all time. Both of my daughters were enchanted by this book. We got it when they were 2 & 3 years old. Children have rich imaginations and rather than being frightened (as some reviewers thought children might be) they felt empowered by the story. Parents are not always around when you're faced with a frightening situation. Ida was able to save her baby sister and return her to the garden because she listened to and acted on the internalized teachings of her father. And in the end, the goblins turned out to be "just babies, like her sister." All was well.While pre-schoolers may not have been able to explain this allegory, they understand it on a deep and personal level. In their late 20s now, my daughters still love this book.$LABEL$1

very dull. I saw the pretty good reviews of this book and expected a lot, consequently I kept reading expecting it to pick up, but it just didn't. Nick was basically a jerk; he (and this is a bad thing) seemed like an unnecessary character. He didn't have much depth and was annoying as was Pru whose shyness didn't disolve until about page 330. I couldn't take anymore blushing or stamering. The entire novel lacked quality dialogue/conversations. Finally, there seemed to be no basis for Pru's love for Nick and when he started to love her I just didn't understand how they could love each other and didn't believe it was possible in the way the novel was written. Basically this book was torturous to read.$LABEL$0

Pleasant, Amusing and Enjoyable. I really enjoyed this book. It was a light, easy read and it was quite funny. I like Jon Ronson and I admire him for his courage.I'm not sure how much of the book I believe. I think that in a general sense it is probably all true-to-life but some of the specifics must have been embellished, if only to make them funnier. The occasional lack of believability doesn't make the book less enjoyable.Mr. Ronson showed a great deal of the human side of the extremists he studied. His exploration of the events behind the Ruby Ridge incident was particularly poignant.I'd like to see a followup story that describes the reactions of the people he interviewed for this book at having their stories published, having fun poked at them, etc. I wonder which of them (if any) were flattered/angry/pleased, etc. by it.This book was one of my favorite reads of the winter.$LABEL$1
Extremely useful and highly recommended. Read Sklansky and Harrington last month. Very good books and a must read for anyone interested in playing poker well. Have been playing dealer's choice poker variations for about fifteen years. Have been playing Hold'em, specifically, for about four months now.The Sklansky and Harrington books give you a lot of theory. They teach you how to think about poker. This book gives you all practicum, which is especially great for the beginner and intermediate player. The author provides very straight forward explanations for his decisions, and in the process reinforces proper play, while also discouraging improper play.This book is a great complement to the other two books mentioned. Will help reinforce the basics -- plays that we take for granted, forget about, and therefore get wrong under pressure. Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning solid basic game play, or for reinforcing the basics as well.$LABEL$1
There are others that work better. There are other peelers that work better...especially the part that is supposed to make the initial cuts into the skin. This one uses a very small plastic blade situated in the middle of the side of the instrument, which makes it difficult to "sweep", or manipulate around the circumference of the fruit.The ones that work the best are those that have an elliptical blade at the end of the instrument, and all you have to do is make an initial cut to get it under the skin and then simply pull it around the fruit.$LABEL$0
No Fine Balance Here. Mistry's ability to interweave several heart-breaking stories in detail is prodigious. However, looking for balance is a relentless grind -- this novel is entirely too long, depressing and bereft of hope, despite the 'fine balance' between hope and despair it purports to represent. The concluding chapters are especially contrived and frankly, unbelievable. The story grinds to a halt in much the same inexcusable way as A Man in Full, leaving this reader especially vexed at wasting so much time reading it. The attempt to associate this tale with Balzac's Pere Goriot is hubristic at worst, wishful thinking at best.$LABEL$0
They are ok BUT.... I originally decided to buy these OXO measuring cups because the price was reasonable and it has more cups then normal. At first I thought the extra cups were nice even though they are not really necessary.I've had them less than a month and already the numbers are coming off. LESS THAN A MONTH! I've come to realize the extra cups are actually a liability because they are hard to tell apart without the numbers on them. I would not buy these again. I feel like I've wasted my money. I should have just spent more money on cups with etched numbers on them.$LABEL$0
Highly disappointed. This was a Plus size elizabethan costume. The material was what is to be expected from a $50 halloween costume- you want nice you have to pay a lot more. There were two problems. The first and main problem is Plus size women tend to be well endowed. The costume fit everywhere but the bosom area. The only plus size women the costume would have fit would have to be absolutely flat chested, as I am sure the model probably was. Even taped down I could have never fit my ample chest into this thing. And if you were taller than 5' 5" the costume would be too short. The additional curves of a plus size drew it up some. I am 5'10" and it came halfway up to my knees- not even close to the ground.The makers need to realize that there is more to a plus size outfit than adding a little extra material on the sides. Buyers beware.$LABEL$0
Unfortunate choice of actors. I enjoyed the whole "romantic comedy gone wrong" theme, and the music was well thought out. Unfortunately, I dislike Bill Pullman as an actor (a purely personal thing, I'll admit), and I couldn't really take Ellen DeGeneres seriously as a bride - or as much else in the movie! Otherwise a good movie, but the "stars" ruined it for me.$LABEL$0
not at all like the others. when i first saw the previews for scary movie 3 on tv i thought it would be just as funny as the first 2..but boy was i wrongg..the movie totally suckd it was not funny at all nd anyone who thought it was is retarded bc the movie was outright retarded i would not recommend this movie to anyone if u wanna see funny movies the first 2(scary movie & scary movie 2) were off the hook halirous..this movie madd fun of the stupiest movies it was a total dissapointment..and i hope that they post this review up bc people should know how the movie really was$LABEL$0
Not what I had hoped for.... I realize that I'm cutting against the grain of all of the earlier reviews, but I found The Discovery Study Bible to be decidedly disappointing. I've owned it for about a year now, and it is still my least favorite Bible.I find the formatting to be distracting and obtrusive. I actually have a hard time finding certain passages because of the unnatural way that the "study centers" are inserted into the middle of the text. I do not find the margin helps to be very helpful at all. The dictionary in the back is too short to be of much use. I'd rather have a concordance than the multiple blank pages for notes in the back. And as trivial as it may sound, the cover design is just plain ugly.Ultimately, I find the features of this study Bible to rarely add to my study of the Scriptures. I only use this Bible when it's my only option at a given time and would not recommend it to anyone. I would strongly recommend the QUEST Study Bible instead.$LABEL$0
Nice sound, nice looking.... I needed a mute for a concert and I did'nt have one yet. I remembered of my french teacher saying that Denis Wick was a good reference. It sound really great, it is well made, nice wood finish. The bas point is that you must buy the bag separately. At this price, they could put a simple bag, because sometime you don't use it for month and don't put it in your instrument case.$LABEL$1
Stylish and Durable, with a HORRIBLE LEAKING PROBLEM. I have three kids, and for the third time, I am utterly dissapointed with Avent's product. With each new child, we bought a fresh supply of bottles, hoping Avent had fixed this problem. We really wanted these bottles to work, as they seem to be the most durable and stylish ones on the market, and our kids never had any problems with the nipples. However, each time, we ended up having to switch to another brand.The leak is not just a spot here or there. It is often a torrential downpour, leaking out the sides of the white cap. I know many people who have had the same problem.For as expensive as these bottles are, I would think Avent would take more pride in their product, fixing such simple things as a leak.Don't waste your money.$LABEL$0

Heed the warnings!. I should have checked the reviews on this one before buying. Learned my lesson. Can't buy Mary Jo Putney without doing that anymore. The only reason I'm not giving this story one star is because it was good and kept my interest - until Viola's big reveal. I figured early on that she was a bastard and that it was her natural father who gave her the property. I was not prepared in the least for the wagering whore part - and she was a talented and good one too. Just yuck. My heroines don't have to be virgins, just not... this. And the reason that she was one made no sense at all. Ferdinand was likable enough. Charming, good-looking, sexy, a bit of a naughty fellow growing up. Yet, he was a virgin at 27. I'm sorry this reversal of rake/whore and angel/virgin was nothing but revolting. As a result I quit reading at page 215.$LABEL$0
Only Maginally Funny.... This is probably just my patircular taste but I only found a few snips to be funny. I only decided to watch the movie because I had heard some coworkers talk about how funny it was and I happen to love Mark W. However, as expected I didn't care for the movie.$LABEL$0
A family of poems: my favorite poetry for children by Caroline Kennedy. I received this book as a gift and was very impressed by the choice of poetry, the introduction to each section and the fabulous illustrations. I ordered 2 for my grown children and grandchildren.$LABEL$1
Fantastic Movie. This movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time. This movie can be interpreted in so many ways and can mean many different things to many people. The young star does an incredible job, considering her experience. It is difficult to decribe much about the movie itself without giving much away. In general, for me, the movie is about the fact that the love of parent and child is the same no matter the socioeconomic status of the people.$LABEL$1
Not worth the price. This is an ok monitor. It seems to have good range and even has a nightlight feature you can use in the room but it has terrible feedback and goes through batteries like crazy. If I leave it plugged in, the feedback is ten times worse and so loud! Using just the batteries we can use it maybe one night and a few naps the next day. To make matters worse, there is no low battery indication so many times it has died on me and meanwhile the baby has been awake and crying for sometime. Now I feel like I have go upstairs and check on him every 5 minutes while he naps. For this much money, it should at least warn you when the batteries are low. Got out of the shower today to find it had died again. That's the last time, we're getting another monitor.$LABEL$0
Never buya gift card from amazon. I bought my mom an online gift card (emailed) from Amazon and it turned into the worst, most stressful present I ever bought her. The gift card took over a year to use including extra money Amazon gave her for her inconvenience. Amazon dose not mention that the gift card can not be used on every item. Also, after checkout the gift card may only apply 20% to each item, leaving you with money left over and your credit card charged when you thought you finished the gift card. Believe me it's happened multiple times. Save your self the stress and time of multiple phone calls to Amazon and choose any other company for a gift card.$LABEL$0

What happened?. How did Art Alexakis, frontman of Colorfinger, one of the greatest alternative punk bands in the world, go on to form a band that was even heavier, and then turn them into MTV fodder? This is an album that can stand with Soundgarden's "Ultramega OK" and Mudhoney's debut. Art's vocals are angry and tourtured by the tribulations that were happening to him at the time, not by the memories of those tribulations like the "Learning How to Smile" album. If you enjoy "Heroin Girl," "When It All Goes Wrong Again," "Twistinside" (a Colorfinger song by the way) or old proto-grunge like Mudhoney or older Nirvana, absolutely check this out. Nirvana's "Bleach" is a good album. This is better. This is emotional, hard-hitting rock and roll.$LABEL$1
Not for everyone, but.... A touching and humanistic look at a young female necrophiliac. Explores the roots of her fascination with death and her adult sexual conflicts. I like how this movie de-categorizes people with sexual deviations; we cannot so readily label this woman a "pervert" after we see this movie. We can identify with her because, we all have secrets and skeletons. "Mental disorders" are not so easily dismissed when we see how they develop from circumstances that could've happened to any of us.$LABEL$1
Fun Travel Companion. I got this book as a going away present and enjoyed it tremendously. It's a travel book with a twist, an insider's view of the people and crew inflight. Some of the strong points are the humor and feelings that are in some of the chapters. One flaw is that unless you are a frequent traveler, some of the humor is missed. A Frank Steward is at times quite frank, so if you can't laugh at yourself, than this isn't for you. Overall rating 8 out of 10. I look forward to the next flight.$LABEL$1
This guy is a flaming (...). "Appeasement" is trivialized here in Hannity's book. Every policy directive from a Democrat that doesn't call for the immediate and overwhelming use of US might is appeasement. Republicans get a free ride: Bush I's not riding into Baghdad, Nixon's warming relations to China, Reagan not invading the USSR, etc. Also not mentioned in this book: bitter GOP partisanship during conflicts going back to WWI. Essentially, any and all charges he puts forth in this book more than apply to the GOP, (...).$LABEL$0

Disappointed. I bought this book in a moment of weakness because I needed something to read on a trip to Ireland. What a struggle, both to read and not to discard. The story line was a 19th century version of a Super Mario game in which Charles and Melanie Fraser wandered all about London looking for gold ring that would get their son, Colin, back. At every turn, things get more convoluted and contrived: ... Gimme a break, please. Aside from all of the tapestry and the score card you need to keep track of everyone, you know how the books going to end before you've read 20 pages. My mistake. I should have doen my homework before buying it.$LABEL$0

a big waste of paper. Most readers, including myself, were disappointed with this book. I expected to read about Led Zeppelin's musical creations, not their several encounters with groupies. Although the groupies played a big part in the band's writing and behavior, we did not need to have every detail about what they did. Richard Cole talked more about groupies and his own life than any of the band members. I was hoping to learn what Led Zeppelin was like in the studio, on stage, etc., but this book was about trashing of hotel rooms, relations with women, and other useless information that had nothing to do with the great music they created. I was going to give this book to my thirteen year old son for his birthday, but after reading it, I realized it is NOT for young teens.$LABEL$0

Worth it for "Missing You". Now that he has passed away, I recall how much I liked "Missing you" in 1982. It has a bold wall of sound, rare for him, and a good hook. I think it's his most underrated song -- it sounds like a top five hit but only made it to #23 on the charts. He should have done more in this style. Like Madonna, he stuck new songs on his greatest hits that were actual hits too.$LABEL$1
We HATE this carseat. We have 3 month old twins and are returning 2 of these terrible carseats. After 2 hours of trying to install these seats, we've decided that they are not safe. In the rear facing position, it is impossible to tighten the Latch belt enough to prevent the seat from moving from side to side. We also tried installing it with the car seat belt and did not have any better luck. The "level with ground" guideline (on the side of the should harness) was only level when the base was placed half way up the back of the seat. This left only 2-3 inches of the base supporting the weight of the child and the carseat.The seat is also HUGE. We have a Volvo S80 and a Chevy Tahoe and neither are large enough to accommodate this carseat in the rear facing position. Because we have twins, we have to place the seats behind the driver and passenger seats making both very uncomfortable.This may be a good seat in the forward facing position but it definitely isn't a good "3 in 1" seat.$LABEL$0

The "Queeen B, Supreeme B" is back.$LABEL$1
What were the publishers thinking?. In assessing this book as chick-lit? It's really a very well defined genre right now, and just because the protagonist sleeps with ten men, doesn't make it chick-lit. The novel is dark and dreary (really); the main protagonist comes across not as courageous but as immesurably whiny.I'm surprised at the reviews and reviewers also, one of whom dubbed this a true successor to Bridget Jones--there is no way Gray can measure up to Fielding's witty style.The book has very few redeeming features. The writing is leaden, weighs you down (where was her editor?) and add to that the darkness of the book, it's suffocating.There's a blurb at the back from some Suzanne Finnamore who felt "inadequate as a writer more than once" upon reading this book. Well. All I can say is if THIS book makes you feel inadequate, perhaps you shouldn't quit your day job.$LABEL$0
A VERY AGRESSIVE WATCH. I just get this watch a few days ago. I buyed it because the really agressive look it sport. I have had previously a Casio HD600 for 18 months so I already knew the gimmick of this watches. In this model was aditionally important to me: 200 meter WR, shock & mud ressistance, the automatic light feature and the mineral glass. The buttons are stiff but not unpleasant. The only two things I would add are a bilingual week days (English-Spanish) and a 60/40 distribution of the dial for the hour-date display, since you look the time much more than the date. The price on Amazon was the lowest. Vicente.$LABEL$1

Rocky Mountain Radar earns Lousy Customer Service. I installed this unit in a full sized pickup truck. The rear antenna wire is NOT long enough. I called Rocky Mountain Radar, spoke with Raul, and he advised me to go out and buy an extra wire (cost $14.99). Raul also gave me a list of conditions that needed to be met so that the unit will still work. I asked him if he had an extra wire he could send to me. His reply? "We are not a stereo store. You will have to buy the extra wire yourself". I asked Raul if other customers had advised him that the rear wire was not long enough. He replied "yes, we advise them the same as me".If a problem is already known, why doesn't Rocky Mountain Radar have a part that they can send you? Seems kind of like a cheap company to me.$LABEL$0
Very Poor Quality Control. This product has great features and a great price, but the quality issues negate both. Take a look at the Netgear forums, and you'll find every user has the same problem- works fine for about 3 months (lenght of warrantee), then gets finicky, then cuts out completely.

Better than we thought at first. I bought this game for my son for Christmas. I had never heard of this game before but I found it here while browsing and thought he would like it. He took one look at it and thought it looked dumb, and waited a day or so before he tried it. To his surprise, he LOVES it!!! It's sort of a logic/puzzle type game where you have to go to this place, get this item, take it to another place, etc. It reminds me a little of the Legend of Zelda games which are also a big favorite of my son.$LABEL$1
Terribly scarred by ignorance. Sproul is a good theologon. Granted. Smart guy too. Very logical. But he has absolutely no idea about what he's talking about here. A main part of his arguement lies in the "fact" that quantum physics is logically impossible and therefore 70+ years of study into this field has been a waste of time and a number of Nobel Prize awards should be immediately recalled. Sprould doesn't in any way understand quantum and, when I realized this, I also realized that he could be sprouting anything he wants to about any subject on the hope that his audience has even less knowlege about it than he does. So, his book remains, in my opinion, a nice idea, but one that can in no way be backed up logically.$LABEL$0

More fun than the LeapPad itself for my three-year-old. My 3-year-old son just got the whole First LeapPad treatment for his birthday, and so far he's had more fun with the backpack than with the LeapPad itself. It was fun to watch his excitement as he filled up his backpack with all of the books and cartridges he had gotten. Then he put it on and ran around the house at full speed, giggling. I don't know which he liked better--the "organization" of his stuff or the feel of that extra weight on his back, which made him run really fast! If you're buying the LeadPad for a special kid and want to make a big hit, you'll definitely want to include this accessory.$LABEL$1
This movie is a Flop!. The wardrobe and sets are very good. The acting is poor, and the cast of actors is Horrible! The sound quality is good, with great cinematography.

readable historical account that is very relevant today. I came to this book as someone interested in new media rather than as an art historian, and I found it fascinating. Fried uses Diderot and other eighteen century art critics' writing to understand how the beholder of paintings is positioned. He uses an abundance of paintings (reproduced in good quality black and white) and citations of art criticism to show the ways in which painted characters ignore the beholder, first by being absorbed in quiet activities, and later in self-abandonment. While the beholder is clearly set apart from the represented world in history paintings, Diderot also writes about entering landscape paintings, stepping inside the world.I found the book very readable and thought-provoking, and relevant to far more than just eighteenth century French art. Personally I will use it in relation to our current notions of immersion and interactivity.$LABEL$1
Mixed reviews. I initially found this book pretty interesting. I watched Thomas Friedman's interview on Charlie Rose and found him to be an interesting speaker on timely issues related to globalization.When I got the book and started reading it, I got pretty tired of reading the made-up terms he used, eg. electronic herd etc..I found the book to be biased towards the benefits of globalization and dismissing the disadvantages.What I did like about the book was some of the personal anecdotes he relates to the readers, ultimately giving you the feel that you're hearing the story from the man on the ground.I found doomsdayer520's review of this book to be particularly helpful.$LABEL$0

Reactionary Nonsense. This book could have been written in 1890; all the old rubbish is here - smug Anglo-Saxon superiority, the belief that "human nature" makes socialism and even serious reforms impossible, the angry assertion that the so-called natural order of things has been needlessly disrupted by such dastardly trouble-makers as Plato, Thomas Moore, Rousseau and, above all others, the red devil Karl Marx. Not a word here about the roles that the slave trade and piracy by such delightful fellows as Drake and Morgan played in the growth of capitalism in Britain and North America. If free market capitalism brings freedom, then how come such tyrants as Pinochet, Francisco Franco and Somoza loved it? And why did the German capitalists finance Hitler? John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan would have loved this book. Rosa Luxemburg and and Martin Luther King would have hated it. That says it all.t$LABEL$0
Helped me get a great LAST Score (164). After reading the reviews for LSAT prep guides on Amazon I decided to this one. I used it as my ONLY study guide; however, I did make sure to go through the book thoroughly. I did all the exercises in every section and this left me very well prepared for the exam.The book did a great job of pointing out some of the common mistakes that LSAT takers make as well as giving you tips and tricks for every section on the LSAT.I've read that other books do a better job preparing you for the Games section but I found this book easy to follow and in depth in that respect. All of the game types are covered. Let me issue this warning to potential LSAT takers...ignore game types at your own risk, they are all subtley different with their own intricacies. I skipped one of the game types in the book and guess what showed up on the LSAT!Good Luck!$LABEL$1
Beautiful Watch. I bought this watch without realising that it was reversible. But it is the best feature.It is a dress watch, but I tend to wear it everyday to work, I have been wearing it for several months and it has some signs of wear, but they are only visible if you examine the watch.It is really beautiful and is lasting better than some of the pricey real gold watches I have, so I am delighted and might buy another for my mom before she "borrows" mine.$LABEL$1

Super strong toy. This is a cute and colorful toy. It is super durable, which is necessary since I have twins who are constantly yanking things out of each other's hands and waging war over toys. Thankfully I bought two, for which I am grateful.$LABEL$1
Good movie, bad DVD.. It was a marvelous movie, but the thing is thats all the DVD has. The movie, thats it. No bonus features what so ever. Not even bloopers. I expected much more from this. I guess the only exciting thing is that I can watch it in Spanish.$LABEL$0
lite weight. I purchased the nail/staple remover in order to remove staples attached to wooden posts holding up field fencing. The remover is just to lite weight to work effective. I purched a bolt cutter for less money and cut the staple into and then twisted it so as to expose the wire and remove it.$LABEL$0
How Do You Know. I enjoyed watching this movie. I like the actors that were gathered for the movie. They are all very good actors and each become the movie character, thus making the movie believable. I loved the comment "get me a list of no extradition countries."$LABEL$1
Just no.. This movie is kind of crap. There I said it, I watched this for Hardy and was not disappointed in its badness. Reminded me of Lawnmower Man, a very slightly superior film. Everyone I wanted to live dies and those I wanted to perish clung stubbornly to life. Their must be better films to waste your time with, pass on this, life is too short.$LABEL$0
Very nice!. I was very impressed with the sunblocker. Living west of where I work forces me to drive into the sun both to and from work each day. I had no problem installing the sunblocker on the face shield (just be sure to put enough soap in the water as they instruct); it took only a few minutes. By the next morning, it was ready to go. The only thing that would have made it a FIVE STAR item for me was the color. I would have wanted it to be some dark shade of gray - not GREEN.$LABEL$1
Maybe not important, but intersting. Gloria Vanderbilt was 80 years old when she published this book, which I find astonishing. She has lived through so much tragedy, lived so many different lives, had so many relationships that much of it really does not matter anymore, but it is interesting to read about it.$LABEL$1
Horrible for the New Generation. My 11 year old son was assigned this book this year, and he absolutely hated it. The plot is not nearly fast enough for this generation of children, and there is almost no action. He fell asleep about five times reading this book. No matter what version, The Secret Garden is much too slow.$LABEL$0

Justified 1. Proper combination of philosophy, anthropology, and action, among a plate of characters sufficiently diverse to give anyone a someone with whom to identify, all neatly justifying behavior that is, at once, both right and wrong, revealing difficult choices confronting the human condition. Ultimate redemption, and its failure, commitments and their inadequacies, all held together with humor and irony, and just plain excellent acting. This is a series for all, from writers to watchers: no one gets out unchanged.$LABEL$1
This is a Great Diaper Pail!. We received this diaper pail as a shower gift and absolutely LOVE it. The system is SO easy to use, and, unlike what some reviewers say, can be done one-handed. We use about 10 diapers a day for our 3 month old daughter and have to empty the pail about once a week (usually on trash day!). It is a cinch to empty - when the last one is dropped in, turn the knob several times, push the cut button and turn several more times. Then, just open the bottom of the pail and pull out the "string" of individually wrapped diapers. To start a new string all you have to do is tie a knot and you are ready to go! Since we have brought our daughter home, we have used 6 of the refills, which costs about $30 total, bringing the monthly cost to around $10 so far. I'm sure it will go up slightly when she starts on solids. We have not had problems with the smell - there isn't any. The little bit of extra money is well worth the ease to me.$LABEL$1
Great Bag for a Great Price. Bought the bag as a gift. He loved it for his brand new computer. Not many nice bags fit a 17inch. But this one does and still has lots of room for books and other things. It looks good and is very durable. Great for school! Loved the bag and loved the price. Saw it at a store for $100. Can't beat that!$LABEL$1

Folding Speakers but poor sound quality! =(. I bought this hoping I could get a portable speaker set that didn't use batteries. However, I was a little worried by the outer appearance of the box that had different sports ball on it (like a soccer ball). It immediately made me think that they sent the wrong. But after opening, it matched the description of when I bought it. After I tried it, only one of the speakers worked. The other had a scratchy, fuzzy, static-y sound. I don't know if mine was defective... but I would suggest you to pay a little more for better quality. Or just purchase ones that use batteries...$LABEL$0

A member of a quiet set speaks out. The author explains many aspects of a loner's lifestyle, and how such a person interacts (or not) with society. The lives of both historical figures and contemporary celebrities are referenced. Many examples from pop culture are looked at. Being a loner is neither promoted nor explained away. The sentiments in this book are the result of an informed, unapologetic, balanced (and unpopulated) vantage point. No matter what degree of loner or sociable person you are, you will be informed by and be able to relate to this book.$LABEL$1
Undoable. The list of do's and dont's to attain results on this diet is exorbitant. The products one would have to buy,the daily ingestion of herbs & pills, and the colon cleansing techniques are outrageous. You even have to use daily hormone injections to illicit best results. This diet would require a 24/7 commitment and lots of money.$LABEL$0
Dissertation Assistance. This book is written in a personal format that pulls the reader in as being personally coached by two professors. While there may be dissertaions for dummy's, doctoral students are not dummy's and should use this book to assist with the doctoral journey.$LABEL$1

freshman at CHS. I am reading this book for school, and I think it is a very good book so far. Im only on chapter 15 but should be finished soon. When I first started reading it, I wasnt really into it; but the closer I got to the ceremony of twelve, the more interested I got.The thing that makes this book interesting is the fact that only one person knows the history of the world. This is a very good book for young people. Every school should assign this book.$LABEL$1
igivethis10stars. this is the best album in my entire collection. i recomend it to anyone who enjoys good listening. a stand out factor to me is how the whole album plays as one blending song from tack 4 onwards. if you like "easy-listening" metal buy this album. the use of synth is brilliant as is the varying vocal patterns. if you are looking for similar music try little known australian band alchemist (an interesting blend of mystical sitars and powerful drums), and devins other projects infinity and strapping young lad.$LABEL$1
Great to tote along. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. I ordered three bags: pink, purple, and a green for myself. I am giving them as gifts for my bridesmaids. The quality and size is excellent. I was a little dissapointed with the green bag, the color is not as pictured. So I will be giving the bag to a friend and I just ordered a black one for myself. I would highly recommend these totes.$LABEL$1
Great CD. I loved this CD. I was just browsing in a music store and happened to notice it had just been released. Since I loved Deluxe so much, I figured this one was a pretty sure thing, and I wasn't disappointed. Better Than Ezra is just one of those bands that speaks to my emotions, and this CD is not exception.$LABEL$1
This Is Wrestling...... Hello wrestling fans.....after watch WrestleManiaXXVIII, my wife and I decided to collect all the WrestleMania's.....so we are. Not in any paticular order, but as we find them.....now.....these are the best way to get the early shows.....5ive shows per volume.....now you can't beat that.....remember, these shows started before we had DVD's (when we only had VHS) so things got edited, but these shows are complete.....again, my wife and I have no complaints and actually really enjoy watching these so very much.....brings back memories galore.....this is wrestling!.....you're either a fan or not.....if 'yes' then buy this because this is for you.....if 'not', then why are you even looking?

Not So Happy. I mainly bought this for my husband who always forgets where he parked his car in the parking garage at work. I tried using mine and had it on my key chain in my pocket. The voice recorder is "okay" but crackly and weak. Also, the button was being pushed in my pocket and I could hear myself speaking in my pocket. Finally, the thing fell off my key chain and I gave up on it. It's in my drawer at home. Maybe it would be better to carry it inside a purse; but to me that would be a lot of trouble to retrieve each time.$LABEL$0
Downhill after the first 300 pages. If I had been asked to rate this work after the first 300 pages, I would have been hard pressed not to award 5 stars. However, the last half was a real slog. In fact, I had to skip a 100 or so pages near the end just to say I finished it - only to find that almost nothing had been resolved after all this effort. I don't mind (and sometimes really enjoy) multi book series but not this one. An editor with a liberal red pen would have improved this book considerably.$LABEL$0

Disgusting and stupid!. I am sooooo sick of this filthy lyric music cluttering up the airwaves. This song is so childish it's sickening. Those words sound so juvenile that I,m wondering if they even came from these 20 somethings. The guitar parts are from some Stevie Nicks song from about 20 years ago but that can't save this garbage track. This song wasn't even sexy at all. It was disgusting to listen to. I would give this -ten if I could.$LABEL$0

A Native Treasure. BUFFY SAINTE-MARIE/It's My Way is both noteworthy for her 1960's songs illustrating the plight of Native Americans, and as being highly talented innovator of western European folk tradition and one of the first cultural fusion musicians.

An Intelligent Mystery. I'm not a big mystery fan, so I DIDN'T guess the killer right away (and I'm not sure I believe those who say they did...), but I agree that the real pleasure of this novel is in the writing itself - Nelson's prose is fluid, his metaphors apt, and his insights into the position of the gay male in society at the turn of the millenium simply dead on target. His choice of the first person pulled me right in and made me a part of the experience - I've never been to London until now.$LABEL$1

Terrible sound quality- like a cheap radio (I returned them). This sony PRODUCT MDR-RF975RK was aweful. The volume was very low, I had to crank the volume on my sterio to hear anything, there was lots of static and as you moved around it would suddenly turn into a deafening screeming sound. I was unable to use these comfortably at home or at work. In neither place do I have a cordless phone, but there was tons of interferance and they were so abrasive to my ears I gave up beacuse I was afraid I'd get ear damage. I let them charge for a full 24 hours before I used them.I would not even try these- they sound worse than a 2$ raido speaker. My guess is that you have to have a chord, or maybe infared technology instead, or maybe you can;t live in a city ( like I do), and must not have any electornics anywhere near them.I bought these from ( and returned them to) Vanns, which was A GOOD COMPANY to deal with. I thank Vanns for refunding my money so quickly.$LABEL$0
Only buy this if you have a table with a short leg.... Yes, I know it's supposed to be satire.Yes, the dialogue is delightful and quaint.Yes, Larry McMurtry (who's written more screenplays and novels than God himself) is the author.That doesn't magically transform "Sin Killer" into a good book.I got this is a gift, so I spent no money on it, but I *still* feel cheated. If you've ever read McMurtry, skip this book; it will shake your faith--usually well-earned--in his writing. If you're not familiar with McMurtry's works, don't read this; it's not at all representative of his genius.I'm going to re-read "Lonesome Dove" just to get the bad taste out of my mouth from "Sin Killer".$LABEL$0
This is a piece of shit. Kindly don't buy this. It smells okay and evaporates in less than 10 mins. I ordered after reading all the reviews but i realized now that they didn't help me choose a right product.$LABEL$0
The dead orchid. "Wild Orchid" is an erotic movie starring Mickey Rourke and some other people. Essentially, it's a pornographic movie, another attempt to mainstream porn. Above all, it's a *failed* attempt to mainstream porn. The movie is really bad, and can almost be considered an unintentional parody of pornography. My favourite scene is when Young Woman enters car, and finds Older Woman having sex with Man. She is distressed and asks Rourke to stop them. Rourke responds, in a voice that's supposed to be erotic and passionate: "I WANT TO, BABY. BUT I CAN'T. I JUST CAN'T".HA HA HA HA HA.Mickey is a really bad First Lover.Later, the prudish Young Woman and Mickey (who both have sexual inhibitions of some kind) finally "do it". The trailer looked promising, but alas, you don't see much...Just as well. I mean, we can't mainstream porn, now can we?PS. I like orchids. The plants, I mean.$LABEL$0
Ocean DULL-er Scene. The first mistake with the title is the word 'modern'. There is nothing new about this music - Ocean Colour Scene are stuck in the sixties and I wish they would stay there. The music is boring with little or no originality. Sadly OCS come from my hometown, a fact I am very ashamed of. I suppose this is what you get from 4 men who consider Paul Weller a musical genius. DO NOT BUY$LABEL$0
Pretty but uncomfortable. Okay, so I love pink stuff, and these are pink, but the little bumpies on the in-soles hurt the bottom of my feet after a while. If I wear them with socks, then it doesn't hurt. Also they run really big. I am a 7-1/2 to 8, but I am able to fit into size 6-7 of these shoes. Interesting. I say: not worth it if you want comfortable sandals.$LABEL$0
Advertised but did not receive item. Not sure exactly what happened but the item I ordered was not the item I received. I believe it was not available so I was sent something else. The vendor did refund my money. Also, I had to rate this toy because it would process without a rating. I gave the toy the lowest rating possilbe due to the fact that I didn't receive the toy.$LABEL$0
It was unusable for me. I was glad to see that I wasn't the only one frustrated with using Micro Money 2006. I thought I was doing something wrong. It duplicated my bank acct etc. I uninstalled it & purchased Quicken on line only trying for 2 days to figure this one out. Unless you are an computer expert, I recommend you try something else. One is just paying for the name. Good luck.$LABEL$0
Sweet and charming book for baby. This is another adorable "Olivia" book. We have them all because I have a daughter named Olivia (she's 16 and still loves the books). This one is a board book for toddlers learning to count. The illustrations are great, but not stimulating enough for a baby - if that's what you're looking for. Otherwise, it's wonderful.$LABEL$1

Defective Item. I purchased this item to safeguard my apartment. It worked fine for the first couple of days then it would stop working (technically the sensors would not be linked to the main unit and I had to re-sync the unit). I tried it out for a couple more days and it stopped working again (once again I had to re-sync the sensors). After the 4th time of doing this I returned the item.$LABEL$0
A slip from mr. Harrold. Glenn Harrold's produces fine hypnotic CDs and much of his work is first rate. Unlike some of his master pieces (A Chakra MeditationandUnleash Your True Potential) this CD however is not worth much. It generally centers around the feeling of deserving to be rich instead of tackling the behavior needed to actually become it. Also if you want to achieve financial independence there are much better sources out there, with more concrete and usable knowledge, likeYour Money or Your LifeandRich Dad, Poor Dad.And if all you really wanted was to feel better about yourself, relax and get more energy, then getUnleash Your True Potentialby the same author, it's far better and actually deliver on its promise.$LABEL$0

Black Belt Mag.. Ordered in September 2006, and have yet to receive an issue, today is Dec 21.06. Most of the time you can count on amazon, but I'm beginning to think that this is a rip off. I rated one star, because your can't give no stars$LABEL$0
The Outsiders. The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton, describes the lives of young adults when they are going through tough times. The "greasers", Ponyboy, Sodapop, Darry, Two-Bit, and Dally are the poorer boys of the city. The Socs,(also called the Socials) are the higher class of boys in the city. They bully and beat-up the greasers just because they are poorer than they are. I enjoyed this book due to the characters, how they act, and how humorous they are. My favorite characters are Darry and Ponyboy. I like Darry because he is smart and strong. I also like Darry because he likes to show off his muscles. I like Ponyboy because he enjoys movies and he always sticks to his gut feeling. You should read The Outsiders- it is a great book!$LABEL$1
Not as expected. You are constantly referred to his website www.lowcarboptions.com to obtain what brand names of vitamins, minerals, food, etc. that he recommends.

They don't fit!. My son is 3 and weighs 26 lbs, and they do not fit him around the waist. His little butt is constantly sticking out. They are bulky on him and he complains about them being uncomfortable. He can easily pull them down, getting them back up is another issue though. Because they are so big, they roll funny and he needs help to get them back up. They also do not reattach once you tear the sides, and this is a tad annoying. It means that anytime he poops I have to completely undress him to put another on. They also do not seem to be very absorbent and have leaked when he has pooped.$LABEL$0
Audio skips!. I dont know how amazon ripped this CD but it skips everywhere in the same places no matter what mp3 player I use. Otherwise its sublime. Just annoying when you're trying to listen to it and it keeps skipping. I want my money back!$LABEL$0
Does not fit 22 quart white. This lid was advertised alongside the 22 quart white cambro container and stated it would fit. It does not, it is way too small. Now, I have a round white container and no lid !! I can't even find another one on Amazon that will fit it.$LABEL$0
Does not work. Transmission of sound and video was only clear when the transmitter and the receiver are 10 feet apart (with no physical barriers in between).

For both instances, the noise reception was on and off, the video reception was blurry.$LABEL$0
Very Lightweight Rain Suit. I have used my rain suit loads of times. For some reason, the bum of my pants is always wet after riding my bike while the ground is wet. I use the rain jacket and the rain pants, and the jacket comes below the top of the pants. The rain is not coming from the top of the pants and leaking down. I have observed that much. It seems to be coming from the seam; but when I inspect the seam, it appears intact. It's kind of a mystery to me. Othan than at my bum, it does keep the rain out very well and is also a very good shield from the wind. I like the suit very much. It is very lightweight and portable and works very well, but I had to downgrade from 5 stars for the wet-bum issue.$LABEL$1

Folk songs about train wrecks are put in perspective.. Ms. Lyle shows a historian's perspicaciousness in her investigation of "Wreck of the Old '97" and other train wreck songs. She finds people who were at the wrecks and digs up news accounts of the wrecks--not all wrecks, just the ones with songs about them. Her comparisons of the myths in the songs and the history itself make a wonder read.$LABEL$1
Don't wait, unless you love the sound of a door slamming!. This product works and it's very reasonably priced.

You can adjustthem to close exactly as you like. Like me, you'll wonder why you waited so long!$LABEL$1
Green Hornet. This is a movie which could not make up its mind, comedy or action. The result was ridiculously poor movie. I am glad I only paid a buck to see this movie. I usually like most movies and find something good, ok the gadget were good, but the story was poor.$LABEL$0
I'm pleased.. I first heard the song "This Is Dungeon Music" and after a quick search, found and ordered this CD.Though none of the other songs turned out to be quite as catchy as "This Is Dungeon Music," I still fully enjoyed the whole CD.

Very good phone, but may be outdated.... I have had this phone for almost 2 years now. It's been a workhorse and I love using it. Having said that...the only real problem I have with it...is that I can ONLY have 2 headsets with this system. Because of this I will probably be changing my phones soon to the TRU8885 series which supports up to 10 handsets.I haven't yet tried them, but if you're in the market for a new phone system I would probably check out the TRU8xxx series phones instead (i.e. TRU8885-2 or similar - all of the TRU8xxx models are the same handsets, as each other NOT the TRU5885, but come in multiple configurations depending on whether you want an asnwering machine, the number of handsets sold in a pkg, etc...)$LABEL$1

Bad bad bad. I got this grinder as a present, so I didn't get to inspect it beforehand. The quality is awful - parts don't fit together well. I cut my finger on a sharp edge of a grid plate. The blade on the other had is completely dull. Meat gets stuck inside the machine and doesn't come out. And the blades and plates got immediately rusted after a single washing. This product is a disaster!$LABEL$0
The Beast Must Die. For all of you out there that are "werewolf" buffs just wanted to pass along to you all that this will be coming available to DVD this July (I believe around the 25th 2006) and not at the prices listed. Hold on if you want to purchase a new copy at the fraction of the price. :)The plot description of the movie is just what it states. You have a mystery going on that will have you guessing which guest at the estate is the werewolf.If you enjoy a mystery flare to the horror genre I would highly recommend atleast a viewing of this movie.$LABEL$1

A great recital disqualified by unacceptable sonics. The absurd price being asked for this CD on the used market will no doubt be enough to put buyers off, but in case the unwary are tempted, I must report that the sound is dismal, Richter's piano being reduced to a thumping, boomy blur that is frankly unlistenable. Too bad, because the recital in Helsinki from August, 1976 includes a potent account of two Richter favorites, Beethoven's Op. 10 no. 3 sonata, in which he found strong shades of the composer's middle period, and Schumann's "other" carnival piece besides Carnaval, Fashingsschwank aus Wien, given a rollicking, high-spirited reading. Luckily, because they are favorites we have rival performances that sound much better.$LABEL$0
Amazingly good for the price. Before the holidays, I shopped around for an "inexpensive" digital. I hated to spend big money on something that will be obsolete in a year or two. (I already have an entire shelf in my basement with computer equipment we no longer use) Amazon listed this as one of the 10 best cameras, so for [the price], what did I have to lose. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the image. (I am a comercial artist) Print it out on a good ink jet printer, on photo quality paper, and you get great results. Plus, I can use it on my Mac and my husbands PC. Installation on both platforms was super simple. You don't need any kind of real computer experience to be able to download from camera to computer. I plan to buy another for my in-laws. It's no Nikon, but I'd definatly recommend it to anyone wanting to get an easy to use digital.$LABEL$1
Great Flick!. Item is as advertised. However the customer service rep didn't really answer my question prior to my purchase. That is why I rated 4 stars instead of 5. Glad I took a chance on this merchant anyway.$LABEL$1
The Great Lost Velvet Underground Album!. The cover, which shows a gauge tilting into the red toward "VU", suggests that this will be a loud, grinding affair like the group's first two albums, but the truth is that this nice, laid-back set of previously unreleased songs belongs to the general period of THE VELVET UNDERGROUND, the group's third album. Most of the songs here probably would have gone onto a fourth album had the group not changed labels. Oddities include the rollicking "I Can't Stand It," the sensitive "Stephanie Says," the goofy "Temptation Inside Your Heart," and the country-influenced "One of These Days." This is definitely essential for any VU fan.$LABEL$1
Cut beyond recognition. Originally saw this film by it's release title: "Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle" and the cuts and edits required to remove the lead characters name in addition to the cuts made to make this have a R rating render this a slim shadow of the originally funny (albeit tasteless)animated comedy. This pale version of the original is basically worthless and difficult (if not impossible) to follow.$LABEL$0
Badly written, hard to follow.. This book just lists up most of the topics related to multimedia, and it's really hard to follow the authors' writing. The organization is bad, so I got frequently lost while reading the book. Too much errta, and wrong figures. The ugliest scientic and/or engineering book I've ever read!!!$LABEL$0
Very narrow shoes, they seem solid though.. I guess my feet are a little wider than most, but I usually have no problems with boot type shoes. These are so tight I cannot even wear them. I wear Converse Chuck Taylors all the time and they are snug, but these just hurt the moment I put them on. So if you have big feet, try these on in a store before ordering. Other than that they look like decent shoes, especially for the price.$LABEL$0
Dont Bother. Watched about first 3 minutes and saw the CGI monster and knew this was going to be bad. Story drug on for 20 minutes and finally just forwarded through the rest of the movie. Pretty much horrible.$LABEL$0
Not just for acoustic lovers. I really enjoy listening to this great acoustic music. I agree with people about it being a little repetitive, but it is still great. You can play this cd from start to finish, and with each track you will feel the strange power coming out of this acoustic music. It reminds me of grunge, and it is heavy. But don't think of it as originally heavy songs with distorted guitars played in acoustic, like in MTV Unplugged series; these songs were written FOR acoustic guitars. So there is a different feeling to this music, it is very different from the regular grunge we usually listen to. And it works.$LABEL$1

A DVD documentary re-examining the war between Israel and Arab nations. Originally shown on public television, Six Days in June: The War that Redefined the Middle East is a DVD documentary re-examining the war between Israel and Arab nations that left a historical legacy lingering to the tragic Middle East conflict raging in the current day. Shot on location in Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Moscow, and Washington, Six Days in June incorporates recently declassified archives, home movie footage, personal photographs, and recreations to unfold a composite picture of the war from beginning to end. Highly recommended, especially for public library collections. 108 minutes, letterboxed, color.$LABEL$1

GREAT BOOK FOR ELMO LOVERS. I sent this book to my 23 month old granddaughter and my daughter said she won't put it down. She wants to "read it" all the time. It's a great book for all little ones but especially if they love Elmo the way my little one does. I have bought several Elmo books from Amazon and they have all been great.$LABEL$1

Ultra Vision, comes in clear, but Rightlight fails. The camera resolution would be good if the Rightlight 2 didn't make the image so dark, even with lights on. I called Logitech but was on hold forever. When they gave me the option to leave a call back number, they never called back. I returned this product and got the Logitech Communicate CTX instead. Lower resolution, but it uses Rightlight 1 which actually seems to work. One would think if Rightlight 2 didn't work, they would not push that for any of their camcorders.But I would recommend avoiding any logitech cams that use Rightlight 2 until some one actually says they fixed the bug. Sometimes more expensive is not better.$LABEL$0
Disappointed. Since George Harrison is a great musical spirit, who brought and still brings so much joy to us now, this documentary movie was a severe disappointment. It was so bad, it was almost laughable. It appeared that the movie was made in someone's basement -- the quality, in addtion to the content, of the film -- was very poor.Curiously, there were no words or songs by Harrison in the movie, perhaps, because the producers could not get the copyrights or permissions from Harrison's estate. If this was the case, it was a good thing they did not get the permissions, as this was an awful rendition of what should have, and could have been done to honor this great music giant.There is still a movie to be made, so wait until someone else makes, it, cause you won't find it here.$LABEL$0

Yawn. I love Stargate but both movies have been average at best,Continuum is just not very engaging the actors all seem like they would rather be someplace else, the core cast is woefully under used and the pacing as with The Ark Of Truth is completely off, worst of all the storyline has been done before and better in the series.$LABEL$0

Too Little About Too Much. I borrowed this book from the local library and found it to be one of the most unwieldly books in existence! It weighs a freakin' ton and needs to be put on a table (instead of your lap) to look at. Totally impractical. Additionally, the photos for the most part aren't all that great. Information is minimal. What irritates me most is each country's skeletal map which doesn't show it's relationship to the rest of the world. Oh sure, you can go back to map of the world at the front of the book and read thru all the tiny names to find the country you are looking at, but you'll probably fracture your arm in the process. Individual maps could at least have shown the country within it's continent or region. A much better book for travelers is National Geographic's Journeys of a Lifetime 500 of the World's Greatest Trips. It may not include every country in the world, but it's much more informative, original and the photos are gorgeous!$LABEL$0
Not a happy customer. My 5 year old nephew asked for Optimus Prime for Christmas and I found it on Amazon. The "new"Hasbro Transformers Cyber Stompin' Optimus Prime Action Figureproduct arrived in a timely manner but the item was dusty-not just a little, but a lot! We had to use a dry paint brush to get into all the little cracks. It also had little paint marks on it from another toy. I was VERY displeased and would have returned it for a full refund if I didn't have to ship it to my newphew so he would get it in time for Christmas.I will newver shop with Amazon again.$LABEL$0
Bite Tongue. I wonder how does Mr. Horgan's tongue feel regarding some major advances of science right after the book's publication, such as discovering planets outside our solar system. And I am most curious as to how does Mr. Horgan reconcile the discovery of quasi crystals with his "End of Science" theories. I did enjoy though his portrayals of eminent scientists as old foggies...$LABEL$0
This book was not what I expected.. The information given in an outline form made it easy to follow. Chapter summaries and lists of key terms made studying easier. Illustrations were clear and helpful. I also enjoyed the real world cases. Knowing how businesses are being affected by information systems was very interesting. I would, however, like to see an interactive CD with additional information like the history of the personal computer and internet with information about the future of information systems. I would recommond this book for use as a textbook for introduction to information systems.$LABEL$1
Boy isn&#65533;t Rob Ryan a really smart guy.. I was ultimately disappointed by this book. It spent too much time emphasizing how incredibly smart a guy Rob Ryan is. It seemed very repetitious. Yes, it is written in a lighthearted style, but overall seemed like it only had enough content for a magazine article. He's been mentioned in Inc. magazine several times, which is what prompted me to buy it, but I didn't really learn that much from the book. One of the least useful of my many books on entrepreneurship. It does have a nice cover.$LABEL$0

However, be aware that Amazon might still have another item labeled instead.$LABEL$0
Not soothing. These synthesizer versions of classical songs get really old, really fast. Worse yet, the songs are sometimes not soothing at all, especially the very first song. The song seems to get particularly loud and uptempo, which is precisely what you don't expect in a lullaby. Please listen to the sample of the first song at least before you buy.$LABEL$0
FOOLSCREEN - Obscene Hack Job of a Double Feature. Yes, I have to agree with the reviewers above, FOOLSCREEN is better overall if YOU ARE RETARDED! They REALLY need to throw away their 10inch B&W; televisions and step into the present. Widescreen HDTV in Hi Def. We dont need to hack the art to make it fit the frame folks, you CAN buy a frame to match the size of the art :) Do yourselves a favor and go out and purchase both of these films seperately and watch them in glorious widescreen, as the Director's made them. When you watch FOOLSCREEN videos, you are missing the sides and top and bottom of the picture!Jeez, you'd think reviews on Amazon were from WalMart customers!$LABEL$0
HP over TI. I really great calculator for what it is worth. The only downside is that most classes recognize the TI calculator and not the HP calculator.

Great story line. I'd like to see more of this authors work. The story was well developed and the adventure was steady and exciting.

Save your money or invest in a Pump in Style. I got this pump because I only needed to pump for an occasional short separation from my daughter. This was the pump that Medela recommended for my needs, however, the pump is so weak that it was a total waste of money (I used it once and now it's in the closet gathering dust). I ended up getting a Pump in Style, which is great. It was a little more, but hey, I'm saving a lot by breastfeeding, and it really has been a godsend - I can pump and go out knowing that my little one doesn't have to settle for formula. If you want to pump, don't bother with this one - manual expression of milk would be just as fast!$LABEL$0
Very informative. This book manages to pretty much cover all the bases about rituals and such when you are expecting. I realied heavily on it for my first child and with the twins, I was somewhat disappointed to see it didn't mention a thing about multiple births (especially since they are so common nowadays 1-in 100). But other than that - I was highly impressed with the content!$LABEL$1
good show. This was such a good series. I learned much of the basics of poliece work from this. I did not miss all the unnecessary graphics to know what was going on.

Gave it a try. Books can be a tremendous waste of time, or a doorway to another dimension. I do not read entire books to wait for them to get good. If a book stinks at fifty pages, I stop, as I did with the Known World. Look at all the bad reviews of this book; they all say the same thing. The author introduces very many characters that are just glossed over. There is no penetrating analysis of thought processes, there is only brief description of events, making for a jumbled, slow, boring, and confusing read. Life is simply too short to read entire books like this that are written excruciatingly badly. Not worthy of a Pulitzer. Not worthy of my time.$LABEL$0
On fire!!! All about love. I love this cd I really think this is one of the best. Fred Hammond is my favorite artist he never lets you down, it's always on fire. Why does he always have to be in my head, man it seemed like he was ministering directly at me? I am trying to pick my favorite song, but I just can't they all on the bomb. So I leaning some where in between Not Just What you Say, Loved on Me (nice beat), I will Find A Way, and It Just Gets Sweeter, and every thing else is in a close 2nd maybe a 1/2 step be hind like 1.0005. This is what I am talking about worship, God is love and we need to get back to love one another with a AGAPA love.$LABEL$1
Random cutoff's blast you with static!!. While listening to my iPod the unit will cut off, and I am blasted by static from the station that I am tuned to. I have only intermittently been able to reset the unit using the button; most often I have to unplug the power adapter from the car and plug it back in before it will reset.Caveta: This is my first transmitter purchase so I don't know if the behavior is normal to transmitters or if my area (Honolulu) is prone to this problem. But regardless, the fact is that this unit cuts off completely, blasts me with static (loudly) since the volume has to be turned up louder than a regular FM station would be.I would not recommend this product. The auto-scan feature is gimmicky and the sequence for setting the menu presets is non-intuitive (i.e. press a button, press another button, hold one down for 3 seconds, press another button). There's only 3 buttons and I couldn't remember the sequence, no matter how hard I have tried.$LABEL$0
Propet Men's Pedwalker 25 walking shoe. I am always looking for a shoe that I can wear all day at work. I am on my feet all day walking, turning, twisting, etc. as an x-ray technologist. This shoe seemed like a good choice, as it has a thick sole, and looks supportive and well made. The shoe felt great at first, but the arch is high, and I have flat feet, so unable to wear all day. I feel the shoe would be great for people with a higher arch.$LABEL$1
Just ok for me.. This movie was depressing but I gues more realistic then most movies that I typically watch.I prefer to watch movies that teach me something new (learn about a new place, profession, etc.), are very entertaining or are historical. This movie was just about lives of ordinary people that did not grow up in the best of situations. They did not rise above, they just pretty much existed and made poor mistakes with their lives. I could have done without watching this movie.$LABEL$0
The performances are very nice -- HOWEVER.... ...FIRE THE SOUND ENGINEER!...the recording is poor...simply put, you can barely hear the violin...the violin sounds like a mosquito buzzing over the freight train of sound coming from the piano...I don't think it's Midori's fault -- she appears to be pushing the violin as far it can go...Heifetz used to lean on recording engineers to get the piano pushed further into the background and someone should have done that here.$LABEL$0

Very Displeased. I got this drive for back-ups about a year and a half ago and now the drive is starting to fail. It creates weird duplicate folders, says things are copied over but are not there.

Fun with Voices. Mos Def ( I think his name is ) had the most annoying voice throughout the whole movie. I wish he would shut up about his stupid cake shop already. If people were trying to kill me I wouldn't keep blabbing about the most senseless things on and on and on. People are coming to kill me, why don't I talk really loud so they can find me. Was he mentally challenged or what? I was able to watch the whole movie as the two main characters were fun to make fun of ;) Enjoy talking like Eddie (Mos Def) for hours after you've seen it to amuse your friends.$LABEL$0

First-rate writing, second-rate novel. I just finished my second Kate Atkinson novel, One Good Turn. Not as satisfying as Case Histories, the novel pushes Atkinson's penchant for free-association tangents to an extreme. The writing is consistently good/engaging, but the plot development gets distractingly self-indulgent in postponing the climaxes of events, one of the most egregious being when the author leaves an attack dog in mid-air as it leaps toward anti-hero Brodie.Most annoying, however, is a last-minute revelation about one of the characters, Gloria, in an effort to tie up loose ends. You can't get us inside a character's head to the degree that Atkinson does, revealing/analyzing Gloria's thoughts about the most trivial details of her life, and then expect us to buy that this woman did something both momentous and immoral and never bothered to ruminate about it. Cheap trick.Atkinson is a first-rate writer, but this one doesn't do justice to her talents.$LABEL$0
my favorite mustard. I'm so pleased to find an online source for this mustard. It is not available in my area at all anymore. I have enjoyed this mustard (the hot) for years. It used to be "Durkee's Mister Mustard," then "Frank's Mister Mustard." I remember it being called a dijon-style hot mustard, probably referring to its coarser grind. Now is made by a small manufacturer in NJ who probably isn't doing enough to distribute it nationwide.BUT it a great mustard, unique, hot in a different way than many hot mustards, just the right burn, just the right texture.Can you tell I really like this mustard?$LABEL$1

The Crucible Meets Town Without Pity!. In an era of post-Columbine hysteria, an innocent joke is turned into a circus of wild, irrational accusations and convoluted media commentary. Big Mouth & Ugly Girl are the two main characters of Joyce Carol Oates' novel, and the story is told through their observations, conversations and correspondence. It's both amusing and infuriating to see the plot unfold. You know where it's all going, and secondary characters are trotted out to move it all along. The bigots, phonies, dumb jocks, cowardly administrators and more are almost cardboard cut-outs propped up to decorate a stage.There are no huge surprises in Big Mouth & Ugly girl, but it is a story well-told. It is certainly worth your time.$LABEL$1
Too deadpan for us. We bought this CD after reading reviews at Amazon from professionals and customers.

Doctor. This item was purchased for my aunt to replace her smaller very worn out manual. She thought this was an updated version; however, it was the same edition in a larger form & print. While it is a bit large for her to handle, she usually weighs below 100 ans is bed ridden, since she is equipped with her Merck, she is the doctor. She is in a nursing home, and actually challenges them on information contained in her Merck Manual. So not only did she receive a great buy from Amazon, she also received to Medical Degree.$LABEL$1

Fantasy Driven Man Flick. Man flicks where a fantasy chick falls for the most unlikely of possibilities is pure formula for all the guys still living in their fantasy wishful thinking world. That's a sizable market!Rates two stars because yes, she's hot and there were a couple of uniquely funny quips.The rest of the movie is just formula:(a.) Lead male hangs with nerdy man crew; has offbeat family; competes with stud male competitor; has a loser job and a bland personality; has no skills or accomplishments.(b.) Lead female, well, still hot; also is a wealthy ex-lawyer. Main role in movie is to smile a lot but who cares.Although the demographic of 5 star reviewers is, as expected, male there might be an audience for the female fantasy world here too.$LABEL$0
Feel good hit of the summer?. In iRobot, Will Smith reprises his role as the Fresh Prince of Bel Air; only this time, the Fresh Prince is in the future!

It works and Will soon enrolls his electronic proteges in a rap and breakdance competition where they have to face off against Boogaloo Shrimp and his evil robot pal 23465477.

George 'Win'ston. This cd is one of George Winston's best works, and if you aren't especially familiar with this artist, this would be a great starter. One thing I like about it is that it has many styles. For example, some of the scores are peaceful and soothing which can calm your nerves. There are also peices which are up-beat and fast moving which can get you going for the day(works for me!). But, if you don't especially like piano music, I suggest you don't buy it. There was this one guy who hated piano music, but he bought the cd, and what do ya know: he hated it! Big surprise huh? Anyway, you be the judge. If you are piano-lover and you want to dive into Gearge Winston's works, this cd would be one of the best to do so. Happy Listening!Ü$LABEL$1
Total trash. I was looking forward to this after enjoying the first one. I was very excited about it having X-Box Live but found out that was a huge lie. Gotham Games needs to sit down with Tom Clancy to get going in the right direction for military style games. This thing still does not let you customize your weapon load out so your stuck with what they give you. Like Cpl. Jones blowing off all his ammo very quickly with that sorry MP-5. Pay attention no one goes into combat in a desert environment with a close quarters weapon. With the occasional building to enter is what your pistol or M-4 is designed for. Camera angles in many spots are very bad and your soldier often blocks your view. The game was also very short it was over too quickly with a very poor ending. I think I will stay away from Gotham Games for a while.$LABEL$0

A great book for real estate novices!. I have seen many books out on the internet and bookstores about the 'get rich', 'big money' to be made in real estate investing, this book however is not one of them. The author real puts it in barebones, simple terminology and real world examples. The analogoy of real estate investing as a business is great example too.Would have like more about personal finances and how to really get started, as it relates to credit, pre-approvals and the difference between primary residence and secondary mortgage.Would strongly recommend adding this book to your library and book of knowledge for learning about REIT.$LABEL$1

Please enter a title for your review. I watched the first 15 minutes, watched the next 30 minutes on fast forward, then turned it off. I couldn't see what relevence one scene had to the next or even what relevence one characters' line had to the other character's line he was responding to. The guy playing Jesus acted the role with the childlike innocence of an 18 year old and the score sounds like it was recorded on some overused analog tape in a really cheap studio, reminiscent of the b-grade horror films of the time. I guess it's the kind of movie you keep screaming at to convey something coherent but if you manage to make it to the end the few pieces that fit together will seem all the more important for the way in which they were presented. Defintely not a film for someone with a short attention span or anyone who has a need to understand what they're watching as if unfolds.

Shrinks in the wash and doesn't fit!. Don't bother with this cover because once you wash it, it will not fit the changing pad. Quite a dissapointment because I like the idea of it and the pink color for my baby girl. My advice is to find another brand or don't wash it, which is impossible.$LABEL$0
LOVE IT!. This product is a must have for breastfeeding moms! The first few days are hard on your nipples, but this creme makes them feel so much better!!!$LABEL$1
Poor quality. This costume looks so good in the advertised picture, but it doesn't live up to the photo. It is of very poor quality and the hat is really not at all like the photo. In the photo, the hat looks like the brim would be stiff and the red stitches actually look like stitches. The actual hat that you get is floppy and not at all stiff and the red stitches do not even look like stitches. I ordered a size larger than my daughter normally wears and it is still almost too small. The material feels like it would rip quite easily. Overall, I would not recommend this costume. Sorry that I bought it.$LABEL$0
Missing them!!!. H-Town had everyone singin about knocking boots in 93' hell I was barely ten and I was singin it! I truly loved this group. Dino, the lead singer had an amazing voice. Unfortunately, he and his fiance died in an automobile accident either late last year or early this year. Its really sad that a talented young man had to lose his life... H-Town was suppose to release another album this year, hopefully we can hear some more material from this talented group.$LABEL$1
Disappointed. I ordered these 'heel seats' because my sister, my daughter and my nephew all swore by them. I was mildly disappointed. Unless my issue was so severe that it's going to take a long time, I haven't seen too much improvement. I'm not saying there hasn't been ANY, because I do feel some relief, but it's been about a month, and I was told that it would be almost immediate. THAT sure wasn't the case.I will keep wearing them because they do help some, and I want to see if, in time, I see complete relief.$LABEL$0
This Teakettle is not acceptable. The major problem is after boiling water the metal sides are so hot and you can easily burn yourself if you touch them. This is dangerous. In addition, the top does not open wide enough to pour the water straight in from a faucet, the water level viewer is not on the side where it can be seen easily, but in back of the handle and it is not clear plastic ( hard to see level). The quantity level is in liters, not cups, even though it is called a 1-3/4-Quart teakettle. The numbers are hard to read behind the handle. Minor point: the model I ordered showed chrome color with black trim. I was sent one with gray trim and a silver top.$LABEL$0
Disrespectful. In my opinion, the film disrespects the REAL man and women involved. USA love to change history to please its own people even its its to change heros and make them American. Ok alot of British have complained about the facts but concider this: if a worldwide release of a historical movie was made making George Washington an evil man or having japanese play the roles of the men that landed on the moon giving pride to be japanese or events at pearl harbour being british and not american. Do you think you would like it? enough said!I am American and love History but find it upsetting when hollywood makes films but dosent give the credit to anyone other that the Americans. Americans helped alot in WWII but actually it was the joint efforts of most nations hench it was called world war?!? the unsung heros are actually the russians, they fought the nazi hard,if they didnt fight the nazis we'd be screwed, the enemy of your enemy is your friend.$LABEL$0

Wrong Purchase. I had seen the movie of "Why I Wore Lipstick: To My Mastectomy" and wanted the book. You see, I had just had a mastectomy that year. I ordered the right item but was sent the wrong book because they said they no longer had the item that I wanted. No, I did not send it back because it would have cost more to send back than what I paid. I didn't complain because I thought why? So, no I was not happy with what I got but it was because I did not get this book.$LABEL$0
Be patient and wait. Another negative review for trying to take advantage of the fans by not giving them what we want.$LABEL$0
A bit complex but useful. We used this text in an advanced organic class. Having not had organic chemistry in a few years before taking this class, I had some catching up to do. This book is very dense, but can be very useful. Being a physical chemist I really liked the physical chemistry aspect of it. There is a lot of material in this book, and it's not always completely straightforward, but it's not impossible to understand. This is a good book for an advanced class or someone who wants a deeper understanding of organic chemistry.This is also definitely the largest textbook I've purchased in the last 4 years.$LABEL$1
Just get it already.... Come on. It's Ty. Just buy the damn thing. If not for the sheer sake that the guy's brilliant at every aspect of making music. Is it as good as Safety? Hmmm... Probably not. I mean, touching the depth of Safety would be tough. Anyway, you know what? I'm gonna shut up, and you just buy it. K? Oh, and grab the new King's X as well. Not quite as good as Ogre Tunes, but...$LABEL$1
It's Just A Cash Scam. You seriously think this band should get a best of CD this early? Or even get a best of CD? Personally, I can only tolerate their pre-Curse stuff, when the band used less polished production and didn't resort to lame pop-punk. But anyways, even if you are an Atreyu fan or not, don't buy this. It's just the Victory records discography minus a few tracks, and a real fan would obviously have all of their works.Also, they forgot the "Fractures" and "Visions" EP tracks as well (I know they weren't released on Victory...). If you want to make something worthy, at least re-release your older EP's on a CD so that the fans can get a taste of the band's early days.Avoid this, Atreyu fan or not. This is just another way for Victory Records to rake in the cash.$LABEL$0
An Okay Game. I wanted to get this game because it was 5 stars and sounded good. But when I started to play the controls were hard and everywhere you went there were enemies. I couldn't get past the 1st level. You had to find something that was impossible to find. But the graphics were a 10 and the weapons were good too. That's why I gave it 2 stars. It's a good game for those who like a 1-level game and those who just like to roam around. It's not worth buying.$LABEL$0
Isadora Rolls in Her Grave. How Sad! The magic of the Dance is missing. (Like painting by numbers.) Where is the movement of the Soul? Modern Dance later removed the soul from the body and left us with bodies moved by brains, there is no place in Duncan for this! Have these dancers found their "Motors?" Do they listen to music with their souls? No wonder Duncan Dance is not taken seriously by most Dancers these days, they have never seen the real thing! Irma Duncan$LABEL$0
disappointed. very flimsy. very flimsy. disappointed with Mizerak. they are ruining their own reputation. they could have charged another $5-10 and made it little sturdy. i will avoid buying Mizerak products again.the one i got must have been returned by someone.. they stain had chipped off from several places - eventhough it was supposely brand new.$LABEL$0
Unimpressed. Bought this hoping it would work well in my Miata. First problem is this thing is huge compared to competing products out there. It is so big it blocked part of my view when mounted on the sun visor. I tried it for one day and decided it was unacceptable.The size might be acceptable if it had excellent sound. In a word, it doesn't. The sound is pitifully weak considering the size of this thing. I strained to hear it when the car was in motion. Even trying it as a desktop speaker phone I had to lean forward to comfortably hear it.All in all, very unimpressed.$LABEL$0
Worst Disposable Razor I've Used. This razor was horrible. It sliced my legs up like crazy and caused major razor bumps, even when labeled for sensitive skin. I didn't think it was just me... The Schick Quattro/Extreme 3 or Venus or Gilette razors never cause the same problems. Even the cheap, no brand name disposables are gentler on the legs than these. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I won't hesitate to say: When it comes to buying Bic, stick to ball point pens, becuase their razors are worthless. Want a good razor? Use the Schick Quattro or Extreme 3.$LABEL$0

I must have missed the part about the blood.. I know there was a lot of literature with this product, I did not get through the literature before I found the product hazardous. (Two days.)I am only slightly overweight, but I have found pregnancy weight difficult to get rid of, so gave alli a try. Now I am quite unhappy, and mildly fearful, for having tried it.I can handle a little bit of gross farting and loose stools, but the spots of blood made me very nervous.I threw my pills away. Good luck everyone else.$LABEL$0
Terrific bottle. We started out with the regular Playtex drop in bottles but our baby would always seem to end up with to much air in her belly. My husband came home with this bottle one day and I shrugged it off for about a month. I am also breastfeeding and was skeptical if it would work as well. I wish I would have used it earlier! Immediatly I saw results and had a wonderful, gas free baby. Now she keeps down pretty much everything and is able to let off her own effortless tiny burps. The special nipple is a wonderful invention that dosen't let any outside air in. We even have the 8 ounch ones which are just as good. I ghighly recommend these bottles! A+ in my book.$LABEL$1
real old junk. The software is called "World's Great Cities, Parks and Wildlife" The world's greatest ripoff is more like it. This software is so old it dates back to Windows 95! I couldn't even get it to run on Windows XP although it says it can run on NT. It was written for Windows 3x or 95 or the old NT. After hacking around for 20 minutes, I did get to some nice pictures but you have to go after them the hard way. Unless you still run Windows 95, don't buy this.$LABEL$0
The Ultimate Compilation. This is surely the best Clannad's collection. It offers us a precise cross-section of their already 30 years old work, including tracks from those first, pure folk albums, over very rare live recordings, eighties-pop, to nineties, in which they managed to keep their place at the throne of Irish folk, but ambiental and new age music as well. This compilation should stand at the end of every Clannad-fan's collection.$LABEL$1

Lost Interest at the End. I did enjoy the book however I did find I lost interest at the end and skipped ahead. At the 11th hour there is a new theory put forth and that was a little frustrating - especially because it is just thrown out there without a lot of back-up - particularly from the accused.$LABEL$1
Installation Nightmare for Nothing New. It wouldn't install on my Dell. Maybe Broderbond doesn't think Dells are catching on as a home computer. I was able to get it going on my HP at work and found it to be about the same as the version I already have (version 12). The box says it now does PDFs. I can get that free on the web. I was hoping it would do more cards and things I actually do.Skip it if you already have version 12.$LABEL$0
just terrible. this remake of a 1956 movie classic is awful. the original movie, produced in 1956, starring Jan Sterling and Michael Redgrave was much more superior. It really told the story of Oceania and Eurasia, with much more depth than this remade DVD fiasco. Richard Burton's performance was outstanding, however placing John Hurt was a poor choice of judgment. The eurythmics soundtrack is deplorable, distracting the overall view of the feel of the movie. The producer was right in removing them from the soundtrack. All we need then is Giorgio Moroder and you could dance in Victory Square! If you are able to obtain a copy of the original version (sometimes on ebay, but the George Orwell society disapproves because of copyright) compare the two, and the original is much better. The original was scored with the London Symphony Orchestra, and the 2 minute hate scene is far superior. But, until its released so that everyone can enjoy it, this DVD version you are stuck with.$LABEL$0
Good for me. Works fine, the price is very good for the capacity. It's a real plug & play. I didn't detect any noise, the unit is very quiet.$LABEL$1
Neat little bag. I love this bag - it's absolutely perfect for my needs, nice size and sturdy with a nifty little pocket attached. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the lack of a supporting insert on the bottom, as another reviewer mentioned. I solved that problem by inserting the supporting piece from the bag I was replacing, and it fits fine. Other than that, no complaints at all. I would definitely buy this bag again.$LABEL$1
Not so great. I had this bag, and liked it because there's lots of room inside, but the lining tore after only a couple of months use, and the separate compartments became a thing of the past. I would not recomend this bag to anyone.$LABEL$0
One of my two favorite bay area hiking books!. I hike in the bay area every weekend and I have used this book extensively. There are a lot of 6-10 mile hikes with elevation gain, which is exactly what I'm looking for. The directions are always great and the trail descriptions are always right on. The only thing that I don't really like about this book is the extensive description of trees and plants for every hike - more than half the description focuses on the plant life that you will see during the hike. I love hiking with my botanist friends because they can point out interesting plants and trees to me while we are hiking. But without pictures of all of these interesting things, I'm not going to try to identify them on my own and so I just skip all of this in the text. But that's really a minor quibble. The book is well-written, extensively researched and gives many other interesting details beyond plants. I highly recommend this book.$LABEL$1

Worst Pitching Video I Have Even Seen. I have purchased somewhere between 10 to 15 different baseball video's and this one is really not worth the time or the money.I guess if you knew nothing about pitching this video would give you some drills to work on, but you can get the same information for free on You Tube.The kids they utilize for their drills have really bad form, which is not helpful to watch. My 10 year old came in and started watching the video with me and asked if it was a joke.There are some good video's out there, but this one is not it.$LABEL$0

Did Jonathan Kellerman really write this book ??. I was so disappointed in this book. I found it very hard to believe that Jonathan Kellerman actually wrote this book. I found it downright corny the way Alex Delaware was playing ace detective and kept just happening to be at the right place at the right time. The book seemed to have no "story" to it, as his always do. I got very bored reading one and a half pages of descriptions of what people were wearing, how their hair looked and on and on. I always enjoyed Kellerman's breif descriptions of people and places, but once again, this became downright corny.I'm glad this was not my first Kellerman book, as I probably wouldn't try another one. I'm a dedicated reader of his and hope that this was just a fluke. Everyone's entitled to one bad book. Hope that was his first and last.$LABEL$0
waste of time and money. to keep it brief...as other reviewers have said, there is basically NO CHANGE in this package.HOWEVER, the cosmetic changes have SEVERELY SLOWED down the speed at which this program runs.here is what i noticed upon upgrading from 2002:* boot up time: takes an extra 10 seconds startup after i login* load time: takes almost 12 seconds for the integrator to load up after double clicking on the tray icon.

Wish I had read these reviews.... I'm on my way back to Lowes right now - I wouldn't even dream of trying to sleep with this thing on. I will never buy another Frigidaire product. This is frankly an insult - I can't imagine how any reasonable person working at Frigidaire would listen to this thing for a minute and decide that it was good for the home Market. It makes my bedroom sound like a meat storage facility. I'm going to splurge and buy a Sharp. Live and learn.$LABEL$0
As Distant Experience from the Book as Possible. "The Phantom Tollbooth" is one of my favorite books. I like the text. Very unusually for a children's book, I genuinely like the illustrations -- to the extent that I'd consider hanging a few on my wall. It's a distinctive book, and it has hugely valuable object lessons for children. So I had high expectations, paying to see it in a theater. They were completely dashed. The animation is weak standard fare -- a cold shock, compared to the excellence of the book illustrations. The book in some way cleverly holds the narrative together, the movie is a bunch of disjointed, cheezy, cheap cartoon shots. Director Chuck Jones did the same thing to Walt Kelly's "Pogo" -- enraging Kelly to such an extent that Kelly took control of the next Pogo film. Jones is a myopic Hollywood talent, seeing only his vision. What is deep in the book is superficial in this movie. The movie is disappointing and bland commercialism.$LABEL$0
Cheap, but motivational. This door is pretty cheap in cost and function. It looks pretty bad (fake) when it is set up. The magnet latch it pretty week especially since my 6lb cat is still able to make her way through it. I got it as a test though so I can't complain too much. If you are just trying to create a strictly visual barrier between rooms then it works well.$LABEL$0
Adequate Not Stellar. I am a certified instructor who studied with Bob Liekens and Romana Kryzanowska during the 1990s. With out a doubt I am fortunate to haved trained with both of these famous Pilates instructors.When I first heard that Romana was going to be on video, I thought, WOW, this is great! Unfortunately, this video does not live up to the excellent teachings of Romana. It seems like the producer and director didn't have a focued purpose: did they want to create a documentary, or, did they want to creat a mass market Pilates video? It's a little of both, and somehow, this video is neither a documentary nor a mass market video. Watching this video, I wondered if Romana had control.As I watched the performer demonstrate Pilates, she seemed self-conscious and a little nervous about which exercises were coming next sometimes.I was hoping to get a first rate documentary, and a good instructional video. Instead, I bought a lackluster mixture.$LABEL$0
Interesting but not enough. Psycobiograghies are new in genre, but they may be enlightening, provided the subject that is being studied is analysed deeply.So, to write a similar kind of work regarding so complex a man as was Richard Nixon requires a good amount of knowledge about his life, his personal and political choices and particularly the latter for the very reason that are the most delicate : how can this be accomplished with a book a mere 149 pages ? Inevitably the informations here given verge on the general and the analysis done seems to be a little bit amateurish. Although the book is good to read, it certainly does not say the last word on Nixon'personality - not in the least !In the end, I appreciate the choice of having chosen former president Nixon as a subject, but that would have required a very bigger work, at least three times as big as the size of the present book.$LABEL$0

Poor quality- broke after a week use.. Purchased for a collective playroom. The toy arrived is great condition: fun design and great colors. Adults and kids loved it! But It stopped spinning only after a week. The frog just wouldn't go down, as if something was blocked inside. There was nothing to be done, and the toy was useless as it was. I had to throw it away, which was very disappointing for a Chicco toy.$LABEL$0

Seen it and read it!. I was at Northwestern College, Orange City, IA back in the early 1990s when Jeff Barker wrote and performed this play. I saw it many times in churches throughout Iowa. It played well in many different situations. I bought a script from Jeff several years later as I couldn't get it out of my mind and wanted to direct it.It plays well because the staging is very simple with really very little set requirements and simple costumes. It concerns the story of the thieves telling us who Jesus is and what happened during that particular Easter week. It is a story told with much humor and heart. If your church is looking for an Easter show, this two man play or I had a friend who did it with a much larger cast with all the characters being fleshed out by individual actors, it is a powerful story that makes an impact.$LABEL$1

Made of thin paper - easily damaged - got wet - worthless. I was disappointed with these - you can't tell how light and thin they are from the photos. They are made out of light paper. I would have gotten something more durable and not wasted money on these if I had known. When they are in the camera bag they get crumpled and damaged easily, and if they get wet (I should have known!) they turn into a soggy mess. For a paper card printed with black, grey and white paint, these are too expensive.$LABEL$0
Cannot run an Xbox in a car.... I purchased this unit as I have a DC 9 inch tv, and I wanted to play DVD's on it using my Xbox for the kids. The only thing I plugged into the Inverter was the Xbox, and the TV was plugged into another lighter spot, but was not turned on. Almost every time I turned on the Xbox the Inverter would shut down with the LCD saying "low". And that was even with the car running. When it did stay on the LCD screen said that the Xbox was pulling only 55 watts which is way below the rated capacity. The unit would not run at all with the car off, and was hit or miss with car on....Save your money!!$LABEL$0
Top notch keyboard from Logitech. I hate to sound like a Logitech fan boy (again), but most of their products are in the upper levels of quality. And this simple, inexpensive usb keyboardis no exception. It does exactly what it needs to do, and does it well. Plus a few simple extras (Volume/Mute controls, plus another 4 customizable buttons).I got myself two, one for home and the office. Solid piece of equipment, for such a minor price.$LABEL$1

The Cart was put before the horse. Rene Descartes can go to a circle in hades for his mathmatics but his discourse on religion was flawed he had to first prove to himself he existed before he could prove God existed, there is the rub. He is justly regarded as the Father of Modern Philosophy because of the questions and problems he created. He helped to distinquish philosophy from science, which is a saving grace. This is a great addition to any library, since it serves to illustrate the evolution of philosophy in our civilization. I would also recommend Deism In American Thought by Woodbridge Riley and of course the Age of Reason by Thomas Paine.$LABEL$1
Single cup maker. Very fast, convenient way to make a single cup of good, brewed coffee. Pretty case. Quality Black & Decker machine. I recommend this product.$LABEL$1
Crazy Funny. When this movie started playing, I groaned to myself. I didn't think I would be able to watch it. I don't tend to go for stupid comedy, but it soon won me over. If you liked Walk the Line (the Johnny Cash story featuring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon which was excellent), this will have you howling with laughter. It takes that basic story line and completely obliterates it with lunacy. It's so stupid that you just have to laugh. It starts to lag when Dewey meets the Beatles. That part wasn't in Walk the Line and I didn't think it added to the story. When it wraps, you feel good both from having laughed so hard and also because the ending is sweet. Reilly is excellent as is the rest of the cast.$LABEL$1
Nostradamus 2.0. During the 2003 march against the Iraq war, many marches yelled "We Are All Hamas Now"! In the Camp of Saints, many marches yell "We Are All from the Ganges Now"! Now that is spooky. How did the author, Jean Raspail, know what people would be saying 30 years in to the future? There are many premonitions in The Camp of Saint. This is amazing and I can only think of two other books that can do this. This is why I rate this book with Orwell's and Huxley's. These guys predicted the future, not because of some weird magic powers or a membership in the illuminate, but if you have the gift of psychology, like Orwell and Huxley and the daddy of them all, Friedrich Nietzsche, did, then you too can see through the rubbish regurgitating out of the udders of the system, and see how things really are.$LABEL$1
Really cute and well-made!. The price is an absolute steal! They're well put-together and don't scuff easily. The only con is that they run maybe just a teeny bit small. If you're in doubt, order the next size up.$LABEL$1
UFC SEASON ONE. The first season for UFC's the Ultimate Fighter. If you have watched later versions of the Ultimate Fighter, you'll be surprised to see what ideas they had at the very beginning of it all. Things like team challenges, and a hot blonde hostess. This season is jam packed with a variety of drama (Chris Leben), sweet fights (GREATEST FINALE EVER), and twist (you'll have to watch and see).As for all the things that you'll notice has changed thoughout the seasons, you'll notice that a lot is the same which means UFC did this show right the first go at it.If the point of me writing this review is to convince you to buy it, know this;If you love UFC, do what I did and buy every season. If you're so so on the UFC, this season will teach you about how the UFC runs and introduce you to the UFC which will make you just end up loving it. This first season got my girlfriend into UFC, which brought us closer together. haha$LABEL$1
Terrible excuse for a movie. There once was a story, a classic to all, that captured the hearts of those short and tall.It was a story of a cat in a hat. The story was great, perfect in fact.And then came universal, they tore it to bits, until it was naught but a pile of inappropriate jokes that don't make sense, making up 90% of the story. None of it made sense. Inappropriate jokes, unneeded parents (Or, step-parents), a dog that wasn't in the book, no colors except purple and green, randomly exploding cupcakes, going into a portapotty that leads to an underground dance club... the list goes on.Seriously, this is not a kids' movie. And it's not for anyone who loves Dr. Seuss. Basically, it's for stoned 20-year-olds.$LABEL$0

LOL. I see the Freepers are going absolutely nuts.. Most of the one-star reviews are from fans of a certain far-right-wingnut website; members of this site are notoriously known as Freepers. How do I know that? I lurk their site often and their members were directed to Amazon to give Al's book one star. They're goose-steppin' Republicans who love their party more than they love their country; they woud've made great Germans during WWII. Pay no attention to them, they're absolutely crazy.This book is great, just like Al's radio show. Thank you, Al, for a great book, full of proven facts mixed with biting humor. Loved this book!$LABEL$1
no help here. Took two a day for a few weeks...no noticeable positive effect. I am rating it a two stars though just because upon a cold turkey discontinuing of use, I have had some breakouts, acne. So clearly it does something...just not what I hoped.I have learned lately that I have Hashimoto's. There has been so much written about the need for ioding for thyroid function, BUT, If you have Hashimoto's watch out for ANY form of iodine. Iodine will trigger the immune system into destroying the thyroid.$LABEL$0
DISAPPOINTING.... I have read all of Cabot's works and I was anxiously anticipating this book after I read her last book -An Improper Proposal. Sadly to say that I was highly disappointed with the book. I did not like the characters - Burke and Kate. There did not seem to be much chemistry with the two characters. Developing a romantic relationship was also a bit difficult with Burke's daughter - Isabelle in the story. Cabot's other books had characters with more spunk and heart. The story line was boring. I say take a pass on book.$LABEL$0
Deadwood - DVD Set. I am a Supernatural/Justified fan. I heard about Deadwood and wanted to see Timothy Olyphant's and Jim Beaver's other acting work. I was just amazed at the beautiful packaging of this set when I opened it! It opens like a book, the pictures are gorgeous, love how the discs have what the episodes are right on the left. I have to say this is the most beautiful set that I own and I have a lot of DVDs and DVD sets. The episodes are marvelously crisp as you would expect from Blu-ray. I highly recommend this set to everyone; not to mention that this series is just so totally unique from anything else you've ever seen on television.$LABEL$1
RCA ANT121 Indoor. This product works very well. It takes awhile to set all of the channels and to get it situated in the right position, but the price was only $12.99, and I feel it's probably the best antenna you can get for that price. I would recommend it for a low end indoor antenna.$LABEL$1

At first I didn't know what to expect just because it was an oscar winner didn't necessary mean it would be good or appeal to my tastes - well it was excellent and what an ending, this has it all the love interest, backstabbing, murder, lies, everybody playing everybody - I don't think there has been a crime film this good since HEAT, can't wait for the sequel.$LABEL$1
KX-FLB801 All-in-One Fits the Bill. We needed a copier/printer/fax solution for an office on a mobile offshore drilling rig with limited space and one that would work with our VSAT communications system. The 4 KX-FLB801's purchased over the last 12 months resolved both the space and compatibility issues on our offshore rig units.$LABEL$1
An Ethereal Enchantment. Sigur Ros without a doubt are true pioneers in the musical frontier. Lay aside their bizarre performances and unorthodox use of instruments and what you will hear is an ensemble of euphoric "noises."The voice, guitar, ambience and music in whole all blend in to form a phonic masterpiece. The creativity and beauty of this unique band can only be matched by Radiohead and a very few other off-the-wall musicians such as Bjork.After listening to () over and over again in a dimly lit room with a coffee mug in my hand, Sigur Ros have become one of my favourite bands ever.$LABEL$1
Great kitchen scale. This is a fantastic little kitchen scale. It works great for weighing the flour when I'm baking and it's very simple to use. Has a nice high weight limit.$LABEL$1
What Kind of Argument Is This???!. I gave this book 1 star because that is the lowest offered. This book does not present a case for anything, at least not in the traditional sense of the term. Hunt asserts, emotionally manipulates, misrepresents, and does anything except actually deal with issues and wrestle with Scripture....$LABEL$0
Solid Modern Rock With Great Vocals. I have never been a huge fan of Godsmack (I wonder if they have to pay royalties to Alice In Chains for that....), but I have always liked the singer Scully's voice, and seem to always wish I had some of their discs around....the guitarist also plays some pretty cool riffs, and has a great, thick tone that I like. Having owned no previous Godsmack albums, I picked up their latest and liked it even more than I thought I would.A good modern rock/metal album with a nice flow and some variety all the way through, with especially standout vocals and some interesting experimental textures and guitar...I also like the sequel to their breakout hit from '98 "Voodoo Too". Pretty cool stuff, really. I listen to way too much prog metal, and sometimes this sort of thing is just what I want to hear. Cool stuff, check it out.$LABEL$1
Southern Darkness. Brandon does well with the vivid details. The late great LA Banks would have appreciated this version on The Vampires.There should be a part II.$LABEL$1
A Must have. Liked my copy so much, bought it for my mother-in-law for her birthday. Happy Birthday Mom!$LABEL$1
Too many references. Author refers to himself a lot, with references to this volume and to a previous volume. If you enjoy searching for section 5.4.3.2 (formula 7) to understand what he's saying in the current context, then this book is for you. Background acquired elsewehere? No problem. If you don't have his Volume I, be sure to buy that too because without it you won't make all the connections. By analogy, this is written like a web application that has many hyperlink references, some of them to pages that are not accessible. Unlike a web app, you are the search engine.$LABEL$0
HateBreed Perseverance. A relentless heavy album.Lots of hardcore metal with some melodic stylings mixed in. The songs are just pure aggression,an unstoppable force. It gets your blood pumping and makes you want to break s*** I love how they don't do drugs because music is their drug and is also mine. Their F***ING awesome!$LABEL$1
Come along for the ride. Original, jazzy, klezmer-based belly dance opera gypsy music from the coolest and most twisted exiled circus ever to run guns into Spain. Like Kurt Weill buying 3 Mustaphas 3 a glass of absinthe in a bar on Sesame Street. Fun, fresh, wacky, kitschy, catchy, and unpredictable. The lyrics are imaginative (well, the ones in English are), the playing solid, the vocalists are cool, and the whole thing great.$LABEL$1
WARNING!. Take note, kiddies: mine *broke*. Luckily, it did not break completely mid-climb, but had cracked most of the way through under about 180 pounds of weight--enough that afterward it fell apart very easily. Although above it says "rated for 800 pounds," another seller says "not for climbing."If you really want to be an urban ninja, get a real grappling hook from a mountain climbing supply store.$LABEL$0
Great Lens!. This lens is wonderful! I have really captured some great photos with it - both portrait and action!$LABEL$1
Disappointment. I was very disappointed when I received this book. At $9.99 I expected more. The questions presented in the book are things I already talk about with with my children, I was really hoping for some new insights. I don't think this book is worth more than $3.00.$LABEL$0
Build Your Library!. Anything by Charles Marowitz should be included in personal library of a theatre professional. Why his writings are not mandatory as texts in courses is beyond me. I review, at least once a year, each of his books just to keep me on track to doing the best work I can. In every paragraph in every book, there is something of great value to think about, ponder if you will. The man has an amazing mind that never ceases to challeng and illumine. Gordon Goede (gordongoede@aol.com) And you can quote me!$LABEL$1
Don't waste your time or money!. This book is drivel and propaganda most likely written by a left-wing ghostwriter? Heavy on emotion and light on fact. Al Gore should be ashamed of himself. Anyone buying into this leftist garbage should be required to attend remedial high school science.$LABEL$0
One of Ours - great book horribly printed/edited. I can't believe how much I paid for this poorly typeset edition (One of Ours by Willa Cather). If you need someone to retype great classics in the future, please call me. The typos were rampant and made it hard to read.$LABEL$0
Worth Watching for Joni Fans. The DVD looks and sounds wonderful on my system. Joni and her band give a great performance. Any JM fan will enjoy watching. Only downside for me was that Joni plays a highly electronic sounding guitar instead of her old acoustic Martins, but this is probably so she can deal with the multitude of tunings she uses. Overall, a winner!$LABEL$1
Disappointed in outdated version. I read The Declining Significance of Race when it was first published in the 1980s. There was no indication in the advertisement that this "update" also was from the late 1980s. Since then, Professor Wilson has changed his mind and while recognizing desparate economic conditions of the inner city, acknowledges that race plays a major role in African Americans suffering most.The ad was disingenuous and I felt ripped off in my purchase.$LABEL$0
There are better books out there.. If you're a beginner it might be useful, but you can get the same info written in a way that makes you really 'get' it, in a lot of other books. And you won't have to listen to someone telling you the plots of books you might like to read someday, and music he thinks you should hear - instead of this, try Jack Bickham's work, or Dwight V. Swain.$LABEL$0
Tipping Point is no little thing. Gladwell has a unique writing style that keeps you reading from start to finish. Erudite is the word that comes to mind. No one ever writes about the things that intrigue him, yet once you begin reading you become intrigued also. He's a master of trivia that is never trevial. I've read several of his books and look forward to more. If you read Tipping Point it will be a tipping point for you also.$LABEL$1
Two bookmarks up!! One of my favorites ever!. This is a fantastic story! I really liked the characters, especially the main character, Holly. The beautiful illustrations add to the magical feel of the story. I really like the author's style. I liked how you couldn't tell who the "bad guy" (Herrikhan) would appear as in New York at first. The author has a great way of describing everything, especialy the land of Forever. This is a great book to share and read aloud. It is one of my top two favorite books ever. Most people who really like high fantasy will really enjoy this book.$LABEL$1
Sad story, sad book. I too have read most of Stephen Kings's books and they just keep getting worse and worse. (I only read them if I receive them as gifts now.) This is a long story that could have been told in half the time. It is boring and predictable. Don't waste your time there are too many good books out there.$LABEL$0
Stylish; Slow Paced, By-the-Numbers Script. Remember being impressed with this film when it debuted, however its 79 release put it (just barely)in an earlier era of mainly straightforward, by-the-numbers scripts with no surprises. The bonus feature interviews of Langella and director Badham are very interesting. One of them has the opinion that George Hamilton's "Love at First Bite" Dracula spoof, which came out earlier in the summer of 79, hurt thisfilm.This movie does a good job of projecting the proper atmosphere, it just doesn't seem as good as it did in 79.$LABEL$1
still missing parts. Unit received in 6 separate boxes. I still have not received all of the parts. Therefore I cannot even assemble it. The vendor has not been very responsive.$LABEL$0
Best Airpots. I have to give a Zojirushi airpot five stars. Zojirushi is known for their airpots. They are the best. Period. My mom had one, not the premier model, just the regular one, for almost fifteen years. I just bought this one with the special pump. I have to say that I expected it to look cheaper than the one my mom had, but I was wrong. I've noticed that after over fifteen years, they still make their products the way they used to. What surprised me the most is that they are still made in Japan. Zojirushi airpots are pricey but they are worth every penny you spend. They last longer than other airpots and keep the water hot for more hours.Update: I forgot to say that it's better to fill it all the way up or at least half of it because if you pour inside only a cup of water or coffee, it will be warm the next day, not hot.$LABEL$1
A must buy.... I would like to quote professional wrestler Lance Storm, who is opening up a wrestling school this fall.***Quote***Stormwrestling.comBret, as you should know by now, has come to terms with WWE to collaborate on a Bret Hart career DVD set. I am ecstatic about this as this will be a DVD I pick up for sure. Bret had an amazing career and I may make this DVD mandatory viewing for all Storm Wrestling Academytm students. I hope this venture leads to a Hall of Fame appearance and perhaps a series of "Peep Show"/ "Highlight Reel" live event, Bret Hart Tribute appearances. I think both Bret and the fans deserve it. That being said I'm going to list a few matches (off the top of my head) that I would like to see on the DVD.***End Quote***Bret is a class act in the wrestling business, and one of the top 3 technical wrestlers of all time along with Dynamite Kid and Chris Benoit.This set will no doubt be worth every penny and more.$LABEL$1
A Bit Too Twee For Me. Cold Comfort Farm spoofs the gloomy British novels of the 18th and 19th centuries, by dropping a modern-minded young London lady with her efficient ideas about how to tidy up life (Kate Beckinsale) into the middle of her "Wuthering Heights"-like country cousins. This movie requires some knowledge of those "it was a dark & stormy night" novels (Thomas Hardy, the Bronte sisters) to get the humor of the premise, and is probably best appreciated by people who know that genre very well. Otherwise, it comes off as a well-acted little story about a clever girl from the 1920s straightening out her weird, ignorant relatives down on the farm.$LABEL$0
Fun and Educational. I bought this for my 4 year old son as he HATED math with worksheets and flashcards. He wanted to play this game 10 times a day. He LOVES it! Before we bought this game, he was SLOWLY and reluctantly finger-counting addition. He can now add and subtract 2 numbers (1-6) by memory. He also now understands even and odd. We've owned this game for 6 months, and he still loves to play it. My only problem is the durability. The box has been crushed flat, and the ink on the die rubbed off before the first month. I occasionally use a Sharpie to re-write the numbers and plus and minus. I still think it's a great game and have purchased them as gifts.$LABEL$1
disaapointed that its not that Fran Lebowitz. No insult intended to the author but I was very disappointed to order this book and find that it was not by the same author of the social satires "Metropolitan Life" and "Social Studies" but since there were no reviews I had no way to know.So wanted to post so others might not by it for the wrong reason as I did and be very disappointed. This is another writer named Fran Lebowitz.$LABEL$0
A model of how BluRay audio and video should be done. This concert and this recording are a real gems. The concert itself has many great talents and the songs are well-chosen and performed. The audio is truly superb with perfect mixing of voice and instruments, and there is very satisfying surround channel content. I just bought it, but it is already one of my favorite BluRays. The disc would be a great choice to demonstrate any home theatre. Even the menu system on the disc is well-designed. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.$LABEL$1
Myth has Fallen to the wolves. I was so looking forward to Myth 3. Then it arrived. I never have been so let down. The quality of theis game has collapsed into a sad poor shadow of it's previous two versions. Myths previous versions are still on my best tactical games ever but this version is going into the biggest waste of money. Everything you loved about myth is gone and replaced with tiny doom figues and lame reality engine.Avoid this one or suffer through the biggest let down in game history.$LABEL$0
Denise Austin - Pilates. I heard from a friend (who is in her 70's) that this is the best DVD to use when starting yoga, however I did not have a good experience getting the DVD so I can only rate the order experience which was not good. I will probably try reordering but from a different seller. Thank you.$LABEL$0
Great Little Lights. We have bollard lights in front of our house. It was easy to run wiring and hook-ups there. The back of the house was more difficult. These solar lights were the perfect answer and the style matches what is in front...great! I followed others' recommendations to invest in more powerful batteries and to line the cylinder with aluminum foil. Super ideas. I was astonished that, after one day of sunshine, they lit up and have done so every night since.$LABEL$1
Lacking in suspense, thick with cliche. This is the worst film in the long running "Halloween" series. By trying the desperate attempts of bring in a new story line about a bizzare paganistic cult is more funny than frightening, the use of gore in this film is shocking, belting it out to hideous and camp levels with no style or originality.The only elements that are worth credit are the revamped score and the fact the mask in this movie is closer to that of Carpenter's orginal.$LABEL$0
gives 'hip moms' a bad name. I seriously cannot believe that anyone not related to Ms. Eckler would give this piece of crap more than one star. As a new mother, reading her newspaper column regarding pregnancy made me so incredulous that someone could actually be so unrealistic and lacking in any maternal fibre that I cancelled my subscription. This woman cannot write. She is incredibly vain, shallow and selfish to the point that she requires therapy (and not the retail kind). A total waste of time and money. Yuck.$LABEL$0
BookWorm. Ahhh, painful!I engulfed Brown's "The Lost Symbol". I expected this one to be just as good. However, three chapters into it, I wanted to jump into the book and slap the characters around because they were so annoying. Everything about this book is annoying. The coincidences are just too many; the characters are predictable. I knew exactly how it will end three chapters into the book! The fact that the professor goes through all those coincidental circumstances is just ridiculous. Also, Brown keeps re-writing the same thing over and over again....I don't know how many times he described TRANSLTR to the reader...at one point, I literally said out loud: "ok, I get it, move the hell on!".Maybe this book sucked because it was one of his firsts...not sure. Definitely wouldn't recommend it, because the reader will be disappointed. I liked his "The Lost Symbol", "Angels and Demons", and the "Da Vinci Code". This one literally p****d me off.$LABEL$0
Kathy goes to Haiti.. Kathy goes to Haiti. Every man wants her to be his wife. A man takes her home. She is his wife. She cries. Little kids laugh at her. She goes somewhere else. Different men want Kathy as their wife. She doesn't let the first one take her home. Kathy is learning.$LABEL$1
Indiana Jones's "Kid Brother" meets the evil Set. If your looking for a serious horror movie here, you are looking in the wrong place! There is nothing scary in this except how much they borrowed from other movie themes. Can't anyone think of something original?? This guy is a archaeologist...and wants to throw the other team off the track of the find...so he plants a artifact in loose sand, and expects the other team to fall for it....Idiot! They also find King Tut's tomb under like 5 inches of sand...WOW...that was hard! This movie is very well written...for a High School kid...actually, I take that back, as my daughter (16) and I were laughing through the whole thing. Very silly movie. If you take it seriously, as a horror movie, you will be dissapointed. If you are looking for a movie to tear apart (in Mystery Theater 3000 style) than your in store for a good one!$LABEL$0
Great, but..... We love the VentAir system on the whole. With my daughter, the slow flow nipples worked great but with our newborn, they seem Too slow. At the hospital, he was started on the Simulac ready to eat bottles and they are a much faster flow than these so we have problems using these. It takes 20 min for him to eat 1oz. I May have to switch to the fast flow to see how that works for him because the nipples from the ready to eat bottles put a lot of air from the bottom, defeating the purpose of the bottles design$LABEL$1
People Shouldn't Be Ashamed!. This story is about a young deaf girl who is about 5 years old and who has an older sister who is around 12 years old. They both have long silky straight black hair. The best part of the book is that it had a lot of movement in the pictures. However, the pictures were black and white and some were shaded in. They had nice big backgrounds in the story too. I recommend this story for little kids between 6 and 8 years old. If you read this book you will find a lot of things you will like. This book reminds me of my great grandfather who is losing his hearing and it looks a lot like my house in the inside.$LABEL$1
Pathetically poor design.. (1) Lid will not stay on.(2) Handle fills with water and then slowly leaks.(3) Date thumb wheels hard to move.I was compelled to write this review on first use. I'm sorry that I didn't read all the other bad reviews on Amazon before I bought or opened the package. I couldn't have imagined that someone could screw up something so simple so badly. Dumb assumption on my part. The limited warranty only replaces broken parts, there is no money back guarantee.But will work if you treat it like your Grandmother's china tea pot.$LABEL$0
It's Yellowed Ivory.... I received this switch and it is yellowed from sun exposure or whatever.... I was going to use it with a bank of switches, but I will not use it due to the yellowing of the switch. Why would they mail this out to customers when there's obviously a problem? Even the packaging was discolored. I will be returning it.$LABEL$0

Great Lens. I picked up a 5D in March with a 28-135. Worked with that for 3 months and felt something was missing. I went and bit the bullet, got the 24-105 and what an amazing difference it made. Color=vivid, clarity=sharp, good walk-around lens. After 4 months, I have not one bad thing to say about this lens. My suggestion, if you are looking for a lens, would be this one.$LABEL$1
Not for starting .net. This book tricked me into believing that all the code was going to be in c# and vb.net. The first two chapters had examples in both languages. Then, as soon as you hit Chapter 3, it drops the dual language examples. As a Java developer having to do a .net project quickly, I would NOT recommend this book. I guess I'll try again.$LABEL$0
love it. This has been working very well for me.Look at the price though, I was not careful enough and think I overpayed...$LABEL$1
Authentic Creole Recipes. I grew up in New Orleans and have seen one cookbook after another that claims to be 'the real deal'. They generally disappoint. This little gem has recipes that I can relate to - they taste like the cooking I remember - MawMaw Kat's, Miss Agnes', Miss Virgie's, and Ms Sis Talley!$LABEL$1
Not for beginners. I did not find this book to be a good choice for the novice. I would recommend this to someone in the sales area of public relations but not the education area. Also, I think the checklists were quite long--too long for someone who is looking more for tips. Other books that exist that are more educational and beneficial to the novice.$LABEL$0
Mis-Lead. Front of Package:"Free Lead in Water Test Kit - See Details Inside the Package" (look at the image)Ok, opened the package, not seeing this Lead test kit.Whats this? A business reply card - no postage necessary.This was a card to mail in to receive a free lead test kit mailed to you within 2 weeks.Wait 2 weeks for the test, then mail in the sample.To get the results you must pay $30!I received a letter from the city stating that a small percentage of homes built in my area, in the time frame my home was built, may have higher than acceptable levels of lead. So I go to the store to buy a kit specifically for lead, and the clerk points to this one - "cool," I thought, "I get the lead test for free, and can go ahead and test for the other stuff too." Totally mislead. Costs a month of time and $30 to get your lead test results. Don't fall for their clever ruse.If you need a lead kit, don't buy this.$LABEL$0
Ground Clear's if you weed it yourself. I thought this stuff would be perfect for the areas of our yard that are xeroscaped (rock garden) that had weeds popping up through the weed block guard underneath. We sprayed it two weeks ago and it barely made a dent in our weed problem. I only spent $20 on it at our local hardware store - but it definitely wasn't money well spent.$LABEL$0
Below Standard. After seeing "I'm Starvin'" "Still Hungry" is a big let down. There are a few humorous moments, but none of the side splitting laughter generated be "I'm Starvin'". I really like John Pinette, but he could have done better.$LABEL$0
Worst movie ever?. This movie is horrific. It can't even be considered a "B" movie. That would insult all the actors who are just bad......not horrible.$LABEL$0
Very Misleading For Families Needing Help. My daughter-in-law has Asperger's Syndrome. She has destroyed every branch of our family. She is now in the process of pushing her yound children to suicide. I read this book with hopes of finding answers and help. It was a joke. The author, who has Asperger's Syndrome wrote the story of her life like it was a wonderful fairy tale. If you go to my daughter-in-law's facebook page it reads the same way. If you want real information about Asperger's Syndrome google on-line support groups. There you will see the pain and destruction these people cause. I don't know if Asperger sufferers live in denial and think if they tell everybody everything is O.K. everybody will believe it or if they are so mentally ill they really don't know the pain and suffering they cause. I regret wasting a penny on this ridiculous book.$LABEL$0
See It For What It Is. I finished the book last night and loved it. Rebecca's writing style is inspiring and beautiful. The story was engaging enough for me to finish in two sittings. Every life is worth a novel and we should all be so lucky as to write ours down for others to read. Many of these reviewers are judging Rebecca's choices or her parents emotional distance or accusing the book of being published only because she is Alice Walker's daughter. But there are thousands of books published each year by not so famous children. Rebecca could have rested on her duff and done nothing, but instead she used her talent as a writer to heal something inside of herself by telling her story. Read the book for what it is - an interesting account of one woman's coming of age, one woman's account of being biracial in America, one woman's story in a sea of millions. I applaud her.$LABEL$1
Take a Peek.... Babies and toddlers love the peek-a-boo game. This ten page board book features peek-a-boos on every other page. Clues are given with die cut holes that allow babies and toddlers to anticipate the animal behind the peek-a-boo! The mirror at the end is a great expected treat for the child too. As a few other reviewers have noted--thankfully the book is short as many of us have a child who wants to read the book over and over and over!$LABEL$1
Adam 12 Season One. When I first read the review on the first season, I turned around to ignore it! But to my displeasure I learned to agree 100% with the first review that Universal made a huge disappointing mistake by not correcting the error of freezing on a good scene.I believe that Universal and Amazon withdraw the sale of the first season of Adam 12 until the problem is corrected. This move would be a good business courtesy to the consumers.$LABEL$0

Cute!. I was very happy with these thank-yous. They are made of great quality paper and are adorable.

Light and melodic:. Australia's Neuropa have put together a synth-popper's dream in Beyond Here and Now. It's well paced and flows evenly throughout. All the songs are uplifting, filled with smooth harmonies, and tight synths. The vocals are delightful as the lyrics are personal, heartfelt. I was a bit concerned that the cover of Erasure's "True Love Wars" would be weak, quite the contrary, it's every bit as good as the original>>hats off fellas. Other stand out tracks are:"Beyond Here and Now," which is a great opener, "Bound," "Lifeline," and "New Day," all just perfect examples of high grade velveeta elektro pop, which is a good thing! "In Need" is the closest track to a ballad, also strong material. "True Believer" is worth a mention. Again, no poor songs and only one instrumental...$LABEL$1
This is a very easy to understand book. This book doesn't contain any logic gate level designs but covers general computer organisation issues thoroughly. It is only 670 pages approximately and covers instruction set design, CPU structure (ALU + control unit), I/O (such as SCSI, FireWire and RAID), Bus systems (PCI, Futurebus+) and operating systems etc. There are numerous comparisons made between Intel Pentium and PowerPC. It is a good book to start with a very good bibliography for more detailed books on each chapter's subject.$LABEL$1
Wonderful book, inexcusable formatting. Gertrude Stein is Gertrude Stein. What inspired me to write this review was the ABDOMINABLE publishing job done by [...]. The price is right, sure, but this book exemplifies what is wrong with the amazon mindset of cheaply produced books. Gertrude Stein is a challenge to get through on a good day, but with .25" margins and tiny type, digireads makes the process pretty unbearable. I do not understand why they sacrificed just about everything that makes book-reading pleasurable in order to save what probably amounts to a few pennies. I take total responsibility for opting for the cheapest book, however, I will never do this again. If you want to enjoy Tender Buttons, just splurge for some used Penguin Classic and boycott this pathetic pirating of the classics with expired copyright.$LABEL$0
great peaceful music. This two disc CD contains much great peaceful music some of which you may had heard before. It is well worth adding to anyones classical music collection. Play this at the end of a hectic day and appreciate how music really can help calm you down.$LABEL$1

FIELD OF SCREAMS. This third entry in the DARK HARVEST series is absolutely one of the worst movies to come around since PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE. This one's not even campy though.

Church Of Misery - 'Early Works Compilation' (Disk Union) 2-CD. Rarely have I seen SUCH an accurate CD title. Nicely assembled 2-CD, 16 track of this Japanese stoner/doom metal band's work. This is only my second listen to the band's repertoire, as my first was their 4-track 'Taste The Pain' EP (see my review). Tunes here I was digging the most were "Spahn Ranch", "War Is Our Destiny", their so-so cover of Iron Butterfly's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vidda", the nine-minute full-throttled rocker "Son Of A Gun" and "Chains Of Death". Personnel: Yoshiakki Negishi-vocals, Tomohiro Nishimura-guitar, Tatsu Mikami-bass and Hideki Shimizu-drums. Should appeal to fans of Sheavy, Masters Of Reality, Obsessed and Atomic Bitchwax.$LABEL$1
Excellent photos of Tibet, including Lhasa, Gyantse, Mount Kailash and the Guge Kingdom. An excellent coffee-table-type photographic account of Tibet. The cover is Tsaparang. There is a 22-page section on Mount Kailash, and a 24-page section on the Guge Kingdom and Tsaparang and Tholing. There is an introduction by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, another introduction by Robert Thurman, and brief overviews of each photographic area of Tibet in the book. There are some photos of Gyantse, Tingri, and Lhasa, among the other parts of Tibet.$LABEL$1
Waste of money. This is an extremely poor product. Do not purchase if you care at all about the information you're storing on the drive. Our company purchased 7 last year to help back up other drives and free up space on our server. Now 2 sound like they're on their last leg. These drives were not being used as a primary storage system thankfully. While used infrequently, they still manage to sound as if we just asked them to run a marathon. They wheeze, whine, and are exceptionally slow. I don't trust it and have stopped using the drive.$LABEL$0
Fantastic. The Temptations are Incredible.there hasn't been another Vocal Group Like them since.this two disc set is a must for any collection.this Group not only defined a Sound but also a Era.These Voices are Wordly Treasures.these songs Represent Not Only Great Song-Writting but also classic Music.this is History.$LABEL$1
Pop the way it should be made. Gee, what a fantastic album! I've had this gem for something like two years now and I never get tired of it.The Sounds may have a strong Blondie influence, but there's also some Depeche Mode around (the keyboards on songs like Rock n' Roll and Mine for Life) and some Ramones and pretty obvious punk stuff.This is a very uplifting record, and I don't mean it's just happy and danceable, but the lyrics are uplifting too in a very misfit way.If you love your pop to have some strength to it and a very heavy 80s influence, then think no more and buy this record just because you will be happy to do so.I've seen them live at the Hard Rock Cafe in Mexico City and they blew me away. Awesome band! And their new material kicks major butt too.$LABEL$1
thoughts on this fine fine unit. I've had this little guy for just about a year now. Works great, takes a beating. The battery could last a little longer, and 512 ram isn't enough to do much when the video takes 128 of it. I've recently upgraded the memory & now there's nothing it can't do well.I heartily recommend this wonderful device. Take it on vacation, take it to work, take it to Gramma's.Get one!$LABEL$1

great learning tool. awesome learning tool for our daughter - she can't get enough! our 3-1/2 year old finds it easy to manipulate ... she also owns the Leap Frog electronic books and this Fisher Price InteracTV is so much easier than that!pros: 1. its wireless 2. it works with 3 separate dvd playerscon: occasionally my daughter has issues with the dvd freezing or not recognizing her button choice ... but is that a problem of the toy or an overzealous daughter?$LABEL$1

Loyal Jance fan but greatly disappointed in this book. I want to start by saying that I am a diehard Jance fan. I love the JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady novels but I found this one so disturbing that I gave it up after 100 pages and just flipped to the end.Why? It was very gory, graphic and disturbing. I, personally, felt no reason to have included such graphic, detailed child rape and murder scenes. The bottle scene and others were just too much for me.When I read, I want to be entertained with a good story, perhaps some humor... and I don't want nightmares. This one definitely could give a sensitive soul nightmares for days.I'm not giving up on Jance but, I disagree with another review, I don't see this character being her most memorable. It's just not a comfortable read.$LABEL$0

An egregiously over-produced piece of pap.. Ms. Friedman has a lovely voice and some of the songs aren't bad, but the producer ought to be flogged.

A great submarine film, comrades. Life on a submarine is cramped, dull, and tough. In a film, submarines can either make for a dull film or a great film. This is one of the great ones.The characters are fairly well developed. There are numerous stars in here: Sean Connery (of course), who plays the best role in the film, Alec Baldwin, James Earl Jones, Sam Niel (my favourite!), Tim Curry, and some others.But the best part of the film is in its storyline. It is a basic story but with a suspenseful and interesting plot.I guess that's really all I can say about this film. There's no specific thing that I like about this film; it's just good.$LABEL$1
Bill Murray is excellent.. This movie is excellent. It's one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen (after Animla House). I also liked it because Harold Ramis co-wrote it. Het tried and succeeded with the Animal House of golf which he named Caddyshack.$LABEL$1
Fools, foul. My first Altman was Nashville (1975), until today a five star, like some of his later hits - The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993) and Prt-à-porter (1994). Fool for Love is like a poor country version of Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Richard Brooks, 1958), only that the main characters are not played by Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman and Burl Ives. Kim Basinger tries hard to get some logic into her part, but literally collapses against an incoherent, rather empty script. Lots of unmotivated violence. Nothing to write home about!$LABEL$0

Buy the subtitled version instead; it does the anime justice. <i>Revolutionary Girl Utena</i>, or <i>Shoujo Kakumei Utena</i> in the Japanese, is a brilliant and complex anime, which contains the best writing and art I have ever seen. It's really unfortunate that the dub job is so terrible. The English-language acting makes even the more profound moments of the series melodramatic and trite, and lines of dialogue have been changed from the actual translation (which can be found in the subtitled version) in such a way as to be offensive in more than one instance. The subtitled version is phenomenal; I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching a brilliant work of art, with amazing acting in the Japanese language. Words such as "travesty" are appropriate in this case, I think, to describe the butchering that took place in the dubbing of this series. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because the anime itself is so great even the dub job cannot ruin it completely.$LABEL$0
Required Reading for First Time Inflatable Boat Buyer. The book will help the reader with complex questions about matching the technical advantages of materials, hull types, and floor systems with one's needs and mission with a boat of this type. It does a good job of explaining the advantages and disadvantages of each choice. I settled on a Achilles with a role up aluminum floor because lightweight portability was a primary need for me to load on small aircraft. My boat would not be optimal as a tender. The part of the book dealing with history and development is also very interesting.$LABEL$1

Does not play 60% of my commercially purchased CDs. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK! Will not play any budget priced CD. Other CDs will work sometimes. I've tried brand new CDs, previously played CDs, new & used library quality CDs, etc.This player will consistently display, "NO DISC" then a few days later, I'll try same disc & it plays fine. Most annoying to me is if it does play disc, it frequently will stop in middle of track & turn off. Sometimes I can restart disc & it plays ok but often the player will continue to stop at random places (not at the same place on disc)and I give up.I've had this player since xmas 2010 & have tried every possibility I know of in attempt to make it work. I test cds when they fail to play by trying them in my portable CD player & a boombox. They work fine.$LABEL$0
So bad I had to get back in the review game!. This is an atrocity, an insult to taste and intelligence. There is NOTHING good about this movie-laughable script, miscasting, choppy plot, Schumacher loading the thing with all these turgid sex scenes like he's Brian De Palma or something...this movie did for numerology what "White Noise" did for EVP-that is to say, quash anyone's interest in the subject.There are many people here lauding this movie with high praise. It frightens me to know that they walk among us, and often without special helmets or close medical supervision. But I think I know what you're up to; you simpletons are positively shocked that more than half of us thought this movie was rubbish, and you feel the need to review it to try and defend your bad taste. Ain't workin'. I wrote mine out of anger at being ripped off and am warning as many people as I can out of love for my fellow man :)$LABEL$0

What a Waste of Money!. I was delighted when I saw this book in the bookstore. Fortunately, I thumbed through it and thus avoided the mistake of buying it. I thought I must not be reading the measurements correctly because surely anyone could see that this method of measurement would render the information almost useless. I think somebody is in too much of a hurry to make money and is not thinking about the readers. Whoever is responsible for this book should be ashamed. At least they didn't get MY money.$LABEL$0
This is absolutely the worst toy. I purchased two of these and two cartridges for my children for christmas and they have been nothing but a hastle. They worked fine the first day but not since. I have gone through a ton of batteries as well and have actually had a few explode in the unit. Bottom line is that I would have rather spent my money on the pixter or a leapster than this piece of garbage. I cant believe that Disney would want their name associated with this "toy".$LABEL$0
Wonderful. This book clearly takes place in NYC, something my NYC nieces and I really enjoy - seeing Max's dad being a conductor on a train makes them laugh. Seeing the WTC in the background makes me smile and think. And of course the kids up and down the block where we live spend their life sitting on the stoop, just like Max does!The book makes great connections - each time somebody asks Max what he's doing, he plays the sound of something going on, and in the next panel he's using their bucket, or their hatbox, or their garbage cans to play his next rhythm.I strongly recommend this book to anyone, particularly anybody who is musically inclined.One note - the larger edition of this book is better. I got this edition because it was cheaper and in the bookstore, but the pictures end up a little scrunched.$LABEL$1
No Eyeliner Needed. This CD came out at a time when heavy metal was suffering a woeful testosterone deficiency. Rooster-haired poseurs like Poison, Warrant, and Firehouse were getting all the attention, and bands who were true to blues and rock were being largely ignored.Enter a handful of bands who nixed the image gimmickery and just offered in-your-face rock/blues/metal. One of those outfits, Dangerous Toys, brought to the table a nice mix of punk, blues, Southern rock, and straight-forward metal. Ferocious vocals from Jason McMaster punctuated the no-nonsense attack, and the end result was a fine first effort from the Texas group.This is one of the handful of albums from the late 80s that I still listen to today. If you like your music BS-free, I highly recommend Dangerous Toys.$LABEL$1
CHARLES, CHARLES, CHARLES. Mr Bronson truly shines in this role. But Al Lettieri ? LOOK OUT ! What a performance ! Between this movie, & THE GETAWAY, THE DON IS DEAD, THE GODFATHER, A MAN CALLED HORSE ? WHEW ! I've never seen a better gangster than him in any movie. He just EXUDES menace . What a tragedy that he died so young (though given Mr Lettieri's persona, it's very difficult to imagine him as young.) Imagine him in movies if he still was alive .Paul Koslas is hysterical (& characteristic),Watch the scene when Bronson is in jail, & asks Mr Lettieri if he is going to finish the sausage on his tray.

If less than one star were possible.... This toy is an absolute waste of money and eventually time. The missiles will not fire at all. I even requested the "black projectiles" from Tyco/Mattel and guess what they did not work either. Now you ask, "What will Mattel do about it?" Not much thus far (maybe if they had someone that actually wanted to help you on the phone). Do yourself a favor, spend your money on something else unless you are really moved by throwing away money.$LABEL$0

Too Much Night. Given Jackson's reputation as a great songwriter and musician, and my strong liking of "Real Men" (despite its preachy overbearing lyrics), I decided to try Night & Day.

Go pull out an Elvis Costello record instead.$LABEL$0

Big Band Zappa at its finest. This album, in my opinion, is the highlight of Zappa's greatest period of work. The horn - dominated numbers fit perfectly with Frank's unique wah - wah style and George Duke's impressive keyboard work to produce an album that has lasted through time. From the long title cut to the ultra-funky keyboard riff of "Eat that Question" to the impressive, jazzy, and spacey sounds of "Blessed Relief," this album is definitely worth buying if you are into FZ's jazz-fusion instrumental works. Other albums that I would characterize with this album are: Hot Rats, Waka-Jawaka, Studio Tan, and Sleep Dirt. Get this CD and groove to FZ at his finest.$LABEL$1
Must have for any Christian.. This book was referred to in another book that I was reading. I was enjoying that book so I checked Amazon for Brother Lawrence's book and ordered a copy. It has proven to be one of the BEST investments I have ever made. This tiny book is just amazing in the Truth that it delivers. Brother Lawrence seems to have been an exceptional human being blessed with tremendous Grace from God. It was so because he sought after it. I have recently traveled through losing a job and beginning a new one quite different from what I was used to. After 25 years of being a manager I am now punching a time clock and emptying my own trash. When I begin experiencing pride issues I can pick this book up and immediately be put in my place. Praise God! This book may be small in size but is LARGE in content. Personally, I highly recommend.$LABEL$1

Beyond what limits?. Only a Discovery reality series could take climbing the highest mountain on earth and make it seem as melodramatic as The Real Housewives of New Jersey. Some of the characters (that's what they are after all) are truly inspiring, but when you get down to it, commercial summit expeditions aren't really very interesting. The dramatic focus of the last few episodes of Season 1 is basically a bunch of guys standing around waiting for a bunch of other guys to climb up a ladder (yes, a ladder like you get from the hardware store).

Nice Sound, built like garbage, company doesn't care.. This unit has great sound and quite a punch. 22 Watt RMS, twin possition BBE processing for nice mids. But the biggest drawback is the quality of the unit itself. First off, the magic flap idea is unique. But the first problem I had is that it wouldn't always flip open for use, but continue to play. Next, All of a sudden all it would do is play the disc, and never even eject. I was stuck listening to the same disc for a couple of days. Then it just quit working all together. When I contacted Aiwa, They informed me that I was just days past the end of my warranty. It would therfore cost me 99.00 to get it fixed. End of story.This unit is either going in the trash, or I am going to send back to the manufacturer so they can shove it where they may. I will never buy another product from this company. And I would advise anyone I know to do the same. If you ask me, they don't deserve anyone's money.$LABEL$0

Stylish, Affordable, Portable THUMP!. My wife told me she would get me a boombox for my birthday (so I could jam to tunes at work). DANG, but she wasn't kidding about the BOOM! I was expecting something a little smaller and wimpier, but no dice ... this thing gets LOUD. And with the adjustable bass (three settings: no bass, some bass, lots-o-bass) it sounds really full and not "tinny" or distorted when you crank it up. I only turned it up to 6 and it seemed like I was disturbing my neighbor's peace!Plus, the radio tuner is digital, so you know if it sounds crackly that it ain't YOUR fault. I always have to pay a lil' bit for the good sound when it comes to boomboxes, but it pays off, because I'm hard on them -- 3 or 4 years, tops. We'll see if this one can beat it.Overall, I think this is a pretty good box, especially for the price. And who'da thunk, because most Sony personal CD players I ever bought broke after 4 months or so.$LABEL$1
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE.......... At first I thought this was going to be a cheesy video but in a matter of minutes I was laughing out loud. It's hilarious! The ad libs, the audience participation, wonderful old time television. The picture quality is not A-1 but that can't be expected from the old kinescope recordings but it is still very good. There really is not much "unknown" stuff here but the video itself is great. Wonderful to see Sinatra, Ethel Barrymore, Liberace, Donald O'Connor and more. Also nice to see Mrs. Durante and Jimmy's adopted daughter CeCe speaking about their husband and father. My personal opinion of this DVD is five stars in spite of whatever flaws it has. Sorry that they have discontinued producing it.$LABEL$1
Great watch. I work in the veterinary field, and needed something comfortable that can take some abuse. I've had this watch for a few years now, and it still works great.

Not so good. I understand this people were trying to do something interesting and yes they should get some credit for at least being bothered but I would not consider it a documentary for it is of very low quality and it seems more like a highschool student's project than something that can actually come out for the puclic. If they were trying to do something for The Strokes, after buying this (everyone makes mistakes) I think the best thing to do for your favourite artist is to buy their album and go see them play, after all music is what it's all about.$LABEL$0
Historical romance with the realities of life..... So many times historical romance books have problems come up that don't speak to our time. The complexities of the relationships are often times very base and minimal. This book has the fierce complexities of human relationships reminiscent of Wuthering Heights but with a better ending. This books centers around a classic tale of the musician and his muse but told in a more colorful way. I very much appreciated the authors characters, the diversity of the characters lives and the vivid imagery. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was that from about 75% through to about 85% thought there was a huge lag in the story with a bunch of filler.$LABEL$1

Just plain aggravating. Spent too much time researching cordless phones ended up going with this one given that it appeared to have the most positive reviews. Have owned it for about 5 months along with an extra headset. Bottom line this phone is poorly conceived and engineered and just plain aggravating at times. There is almost a constant buzzing sound in the background (I am not running a WIFI network), the controls on the handset are very complicated (way more so than even the most "advanced" cell phone) and I consider myself a technofile. I just wanted a high quality cordless phone that had a good signal, battery life, looked good and was free of defects what I got was a phone with questionable sound quality and a need for a PHD to figure out how it works. For those of you with a temper save yourself from eventually chucking this phone at the wall and look elsewhere.$LABEL$0

okay, but not THAT good. it's alright, but a little hokey and dated, and i don't know what book most of the other reviewers on this page read. two young men find a manuscript in the ruins of a castle about a guy shooting white pigs out his window. wow. talk about "cosmic dread" and "icy terror". there was nothing spectacular or even slightly memorable about this book, except the beginning. the reason everyone gives such verbose praise to this thoroughly forgettable, antiquated novel is that lovecraft said a few good words about it. but let's remember our friendly neighborhood sheep, he was a man of his times, and i seriously doubt that if he was alive he would have such lavish praise for this novel now. lovecraft's material dated well (except for the racism), so did blackwood's (aside from the pantheism), so did lefanu and bierce's:hodgson's most certainly did not. skip it and read something by arthur machen or thomas ligotti.$LABEL$0

Wow.. Isaac Brock is a pure genius. On this album, there is a wide variety of music. From the 10 minute-long "Truckers Atlas" to "Cowboy Dan" to the fiddle in "Jesus Christ Was An Only Child". I must say, I cannot be more impressed by this album than I already am. It is one of the few CD's that I can listen to all the way through and not get tired of it. The guitars are fantastic on all the songs, and the lyrics are incredible. If you've never heard of Modest Mouse, then I suggest that you give this CD a try and get into some great indie-rock music.$LABEL$1

"Animal Crackers In My Soup"---INDEED!.

The turn-off began with the initial characterization that we "boys" were stereotypes who thrived on Shirley Temple's "Animal Crackers In My Soup"He's got it wrong; he's upset by his own unfortunate experience and he joins a horde of writers whose bitterness shows in their petty accounts of WWII.

Dr.Benjamin Hobhouse. This is a book which simplifies QFT in a way not suitable for learning the real principles and theoretical foundations of QFT. It uses the synthetic path integral approach only, whilst the canonical approach is more appropiate to understand the foundations of QFT. For this, it is not enough to know how to write down the path integral and calculate scattering amplitudes only. It is good for an experimentalist, who wants to apply the theory of QFT to his measurments and vice versa. Who wants only to have a glance at QFT (including recent developemants) without being too superficial, the book of Michele Maggiore or the book of Thomas Banks are more useful, exactly because they present both approaches. For a major in QFT the book of George Sterman can be recommended.$LABEL$0

Wow!. This product was recommended by Real Simple Magazine for individuals looking for a volumizing shampoo. I decided to order it, but figured it would be comparable to the dozens of other "volumizing" shampoos that I've tried in the past. I have to say I am very pleasantly surprised at the results I'm getting with this shampoo. This is the first shampoo I've ever used that makes my hair feel really clean and not weighed down, without causing it to feel dried out. In fact, my hair feels healthy and incredibly soft (even without using conditioner), and it is very managable! I very highly recommend this shampoo for people with fine hair.$LABEL$1

So Poorly Written neither of us could plow through it. Did the author get paid by finding and using the most obscure words to describe his thoughts? If so, he was a success.

The best just got better!. I have had a couple of pairs of iGrado's for the past 3 years or so. The cable they came with are very thin and do not handle wear. I've been looking for cable replacements (yes, the iGrado's are worth salvaging) but decided it was cheaper and easier to just buy new ones. Well to my surprise, the new ones are better. The cable is much thicker with a thick jacket. The Y split in the cable is much more rugged and the plug is a nice L shape now. I also noticed the headband is wider and a little more comfy. Best of all, they sound the same--GREAT.Do not be fooled by other reviews of behind-the-head headphones that get 4 and 5 stars--they sound nowhere near as good as the iGrado's. If you want good bass and a great sound from top to bottom in the behind-the-ear form factor, the iGRADO's are THE BEST. Don't spend half to ultimately be unsatisfied.$LABEL$1

Classic synth sounds!. Touch is another synthpop masterpiece by Eurythmics that has stood the test of time very well. Not quite on the level of Sweet Dreams, it nevertheless contains brilliant songs like the atmospheric Here Comes The Rain Again with its evocative lyric, the compelling Right By Your Side with its riveting reggae beat and the soulful Who's That Girl. The arrangements are innovative throughout and lend merit even to the lesser songs like Regrets with its frisky trumpets. Another favorite of mine is Paint A Rumour with its skittering beat and subtle synth flourishes - it really grows on you. On Touch, Eurythmics consolidated the sound they introduced on Sweet Dreams, before they veered off into new directions with 1985's Be Yourself Tonight and the following year's Revenge.

An attention getter!. We bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He loved it and still does. He really does not care about the story too much. He mostly likes the music, counting, and pointing to pictures and it tells what the picture is. Its very durable. The only problem is the cartriages are small, but we try to keep the books and cartriages in a back pack. We bought all the books but he loves Ernie's Neighborhood and Blue's Clues the most. It was definately worth it!$LABEL$1
Terrible. Terrible movie. Bad animation, horrible character design, even worse story that couldn't decide if it was a teen angst comedy or military sci-fi. A real waste of a license with potential. Original mecha designs from the MOSPEADA series are good, but there is nothing worth while to see here. Robotech, despite its hacked pedigree, is ripe for some good story telling of what other people went through during the various alien invasions - but this movie is a feature length sophomoric fan fiction product. I cannot imagine ever wanting to watch it again. A shame, as being a mecha fan I would really like to see a serious effort homegrown in America.$LABEL$0
Try to see it my way. After seeing Paul McCartney's Tours for Flowers in the Dirt and Off the Ground, I'll say his voice for this tour was the best I've ever heard. Listen to "Get Back" & "Paul is Live" then listen to this. The songs, stage show,overall effects, the band and his voice haven't been this good since the Wings "RockShow" video. Every minute was full of an energy and enthusiasm I thought was lost long ago. If you have a home theater system set it for stadium or arena and crank it!!!$LABEL$1
Thumbs down on this one.... I just finished reading this book and all I can say is that it's like reading one of those "for entertainment purposes only" astrology books. The things the author has to say about my AB blood type just do not fit with reality as I know it. He has my physiology wrong and my personality wrong- and wrong in some very fundamental ways. Foods he says I shouldn't eat are foods that I do well on and foods that he recommends as highly beneficial give me heart burn. He says people with my blood type don't lose weight using lo-carb, high fat and protein diets i.e. (Dr.Atkins). In actuality- the Atkins diet is the only way I have ever been able to lose weight. For anyone sincerely interested in improving their health, I would recommend reading "Sugar Blues" by William Dufty, "NeanderThin" by Ray Audette and "Dr Atkins New Diet Revolution" by Dr. Atkins. These are good solid books that have seriously helped me. Not pseudo science like "Eat Right for Your Type".$LABEL$0
Review #71. I've browsed the other 70 reviews and have been overwhelemd by the stars. I have to tell you, however, that Angel Dust is the worst album ever created. My first college roommate played it every day (along with Empire from Queensryche) and it never grew on me. This is an educated review. Why? - I've heard this stinking album over and over and I hate it. I'm glad FNM is dead and buried.$LABEL$0
Ivy = Fun! Laugh out loud! Escape!. If laughter is the best medicine; then I am surely cured of the winter doldrums! Quinn skewers the worst of corporate America's covert antics, the sometimes over-the-top entitlements taken by the privilaged few and the foibles of the nearing-middle-aged woman trying to reinvent her life after being dealt the double whammy of losing job and marriage simultaneouly. Not since Bridget Jones have I laughed out loud this much! Thank you Karen Quinn-keep writing! Hope to see it as a movie and read your next book.$LABEL$1
Welcome Back Bob. In the era of bubblegum pop crammed down our throats by the diluge of boy bands, teen-pop princesses, and tasteless record executives, Dylan's newest, "Love and Theft" is the stuff dreams are made of... perfect songwriting, lyrical prowess, and one of the tightest bands ever assembled. Dylan's latest masterpiece is the long-awaited follow up to the 1997 multi-Grammy award winning "Time Out of Mind" and is more than worth the wait. If you love top-notch songwriting and the incredible group dynamic possessed by Dylan's latest band (his road band for the last several years), you need to do yourself a favor and pick up this album!Sadly, this album was released on the same date as the horrible terrorist attacks in NYC and Washington. However, leave it to Bob Dylan and his impeccable songwriting talents to add some joy and pleasure into a dark and dismal day in American history. A true masterpiece.$LABEL$1
shimmering hints of electronica. Chilled, smooth music to suit your every mood that you can occasionally sing along to with divine, understated vocals by Donna Rawlins, shimmering hints of electronica (especially in Shadows Fall) and moments of sheer Pop classicism (Daeya). Check out Rawlins in her three (!) other bands, Country-Bluegrass group Rosemont Crossing, the Goddess-Rock, all-girl Drawing Down the Moon, and Folk-Pop band Imaginary Friends.$LABEL$1

No single player campaign... I'm giving Red Orchestra a bad review as it is just plainly false advertising. I don't have high speed internet and bought the game in a local store thinking by looking at the case it had a actual single player mode... it doesn't. It did say a internet connection was required to activate the game, it does not say if you have 56K you will be downloading for 4+ days just to get a glimpse of the game.I usually buy games for the single player mode as I don't have a choice of getting broadband where we live, I guess I'll be more careful when it comes to these kinds of products.The game, once I got to it, was pretty cool but gets boring fast in the practice mode, there is no campaigns etc for a single player. I'd give the gameplay a nice score say 4 stars, if you got broadband this would definately be a good game to purchase. But they need to describe the game and the hoops you need to jump through to play it more thoroughly on the packaging...$LABEL$0

Fantastic Romance/Drama. This is the first book that I have read from this author and I am greatly impressed. After reading the opening chapter, I felt as if I was home again. Everyone who reads this will be able to relate to the characters. Whether it be to Randi & Kay personally, to their families or to their workplaces. I really enjoyed how you never knew from one moment to the next what their ex's were up to. All of the characters are richly drawn and real to life. Unlike many books written these days you really do not know how it will end. Will they admit their feelings for each other? And if they do, will they still in the end to back to their ex's out of guilt or fear? This book is a roller coaster ride that I highly recommend. Kudos.$LABEL$1
Another Good album!!!. The cd is okay(and I am a big MOS fan)...............I was kinda expecting more but overall the songs are nice but the album is sooo short.$LABEL$1
has many flaws! not her best by far. Just not sure why martina would record a cd of remakes this early in her career! I did not care for any of these songs. Martina should have left this cd out and recorded something like her "wild angels" cd. I dont even like her voice on any of these songs. I would not encourage any one to buy this cd, buy her last one "martina" to hear her in her full glory!$LABEL$0
Overall, Great Product!. If you have an iPod video and love to go running or jogging, this armband is prefect! It easily just goes around your arm and your off to run with your music playing!$LABEL$1
Wonderful book for ALL teen age girls!!. This is a wonderful book that all teen age girls should read. It is full of wonderful ideas on how to be the best that you can be. The importance of being proud of who you are is stressed over and over again. Goal setting and attitude are discussed. The book gives many practical suggestions on how to look your best using color and style, and how to establish your own identy. A great handbook for all teen age girls and their mothers.$LABEL$1

Lennon Acoustic. This is a piece of Lennon history. It travels from some intimate moments with John, to some stellar live performances. The album moves at a nice pace, it doesn't drag at all. The three live recordings are very good. Real Love sounds great here. What caught me by surprise was Look At Me. Though it has a great message, the sound of the original always turned me off a bit. This version helped me to embrace John's lyrics.For some reason, Amazon lists an extra track, "I'm A Man". This is not a track on the album. Check the back cover, shown as a customer image, to see for yourself.$LABEL$1
I should have listened to other rating!. Had 1 week, and other than very difficult to read front panel, that I can live with, but as already destroyed one of my favorite cassettes, the Ways of a Ship, I was heartbroken, well very sad, it just stopped and I ejected with a few feet tape behind and completely cut off. The whole reason I bought was to have a cassette player. I afraid to use it again, if I were you look somewhere's else.$LABEL$0

To be read with caution. This book amasses a lot of information from different sources, apparently more interested in capturing the reader's attention at any cost rather than in giving accurate information. Some statements are a challenge to the basic facts of Portuguese history and a challenge to the basic notions of history periods in general. There is no such thing as a "pre-historic Lusitania" as this book says. In level of mediocrity this book is comparable to Ian Robertson's A Traveller's History of Portugal, two books to be read (if at all) with a good deal of caution.$LABEL$0
The PILL. No what I expected, very slow and not interesting. absolutely no point. unreal and at some point stupid.Boring and expensive for this type of movie.....$LABEL$0
pretentious and contrived. Being a huge fan of the science fiction genre, I was delighted to learn of a sci fi movie whose theatrical release I somehow missed. And Bruce Willis playing the hero being means it must be a sure fire hit, right ?Wrong ! This was truly the most contrived and unimaginitive piece of drivel I have seen in a long time. And no, I'm not "slow" or unsophisticated. I just didn't see any ideas here which had not been done, significantly better, by Star Trek, Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The only character I found modestly intriguing was the opera singer alien. And she got wasted rather quickly, leaving only the highly stereotypical characters. The above average visuals were not enough to redeem the tired plot.My advice is rent it if you are really curious. It was certainly not worthy of being added to my fine sci fi DVD collection.$LABEL$0
A book that says nothing. I rarely write reviews on Amazon, but I can't help but try to save someone else from the frustration of wasting time on this book. While I typically enjoy almost any business book, this one was painful. Lots of mumbo-jumbo with no real substance, this book continually uses it's own title as though it were a buzzword that had some sort of real meaning. Since it was only vaguely (at best) defined the whole book is very foggy and unclear.You know how you often times have to wade through the first chapter or two of a book to get to the meat? You feel like it hasn't really said anything but is just about to get going? You'll still feel like that when you get to the end of this one.$LABEL$0
Weak Sloppy Art and Poor Writing Insult the Series. The orginal 8 episode Bubblegum Crisis is a masterpiece of great futuristic anime and one of my all time favorites. The art in this new version 2040 is a total insult to the franchise and looks worse than the Flintstones or Scooby-Doo. I mean you have these monsters that look like a paper cut out with a couple of holes and bolt, and none of the great writing that came with the original. I almost never bash anime but in this case the art is so bad it deserves it. It is like someone just picked up the title to make a quick yen and spent no time, money, or thought on it because they were counting on the fame of the original to sell it. I am sure they made their money because of that but this is truly the worst quality anime I have ever seen, yes, the worst. Don't reward these makers of junk who insult the awesome original Bubblegum Crisis.$LABEL$0

Boring, boring, boring. Grisham has definitely lost his edge! Where is the suspense? Where are the page turners we so eagerly awaited since "The King of Torts"?

Now I have to buy a new handset too!$LABEL$0
Solid book on introductory QM. This book is a good place to start your introductory study of QM. The historical material at the start provides a good motivaion and perspective on further developments in QM. All the important and pivotal aspects of Nonrelativistic QM are worked out in considerable details and this is a boon for a newcomer. Studying books like Merzbacker or Schiff becomes easy after this. The only shortcoming is the lack of problems, most are exercises.$LABEL$1
Great, with one mistake. Like the other reviewer said, this is a great 1 disc distillation of The 2 CD "Cup of Loneliness" compilation that also adds "She Thinks I Still Care" from the United Artists period. If you want more than this get "Cup of Loneliness" and The Razor and Tie "She Thinks I still Care". For some reason, both this and the other Mercury compilation substitute a rerecording of "Why Baby Why". I don't know why since they use the orginals of a couple other Starday recordings. Anyway, if you want the original version, which I think is better, you'll find it on Columbia's Spirit of Country, and probably a 100 other compilations.$LABEL$1

Better than Kiss The Girls. I think Morgan Freeman was superb, as always. I was pleasantly surprised with the acting of Monica Potter though. I think that the suspense was great, with plenty of twists through the movie. It was much better than Kiss The Girls in fact, a movie I could figure the "bad-guy" out before it was half over. The only bad thing I can say about the movie, is the car crash in the beginning. It looked terrible, and was too obvious it had been done on computers. If you enjoy drama/suspense films, you'll surely enjoy this one.$LABEL$1

Great book with great ideas simplified. This book is as good as a thick textbook on copywriting. Mr. Kennedy doesnt waste words and gets to the point in every sentence in this book. Also of great interest are copies of sales letters he wrote for his clients.What I liked about this book was chapter/step 6: Getting your sales letter read. There are generous examples of attention-getting headlines and fill in the blank headlines. A lot of these caught my attention and I'm very picky about which emails to open because I've looked at thousands of them, but the samples in this book are still good to use.I like this book because it is like AWAI's copywriting course condensed into one book.Read this book today and start writing better copy.$LABEL$1
Nice Collection. Even though Hanson are viewed as that lil boy group that sang that "Mmm Bop" song, one might be surprised to know that they did more after that and even still have a small, but very devoted fanbase. This set represents their work from 1997-2000. It has the singles that made them famous from their first album including their only two top 10 hits "Mmm Bop" and "I Will Come To You." They also had minor hits with "Where's the Love", "This Time Around", "Weird", and "If Only." This even includes a track from their Christmas album.$LABEL$1
Don't Get These. I ordered the three because I was looking for these games that would be able to work on a mac computer and it said that they did, well they don't! SO if anyone looks at these hoping they do, don't bother because I can't even install them$LABEL$0

Good, but.... I wanted a few books for reference, to share with working musician friends. This book does seem to be complete, but, with its total lack of diagrams and illustrations, really makes for very boring reading.I would recommend instead this book: "Live Sound Reinforcement: A Comprehensive Guide to P.A. and Music Reinforcement Systems and Technology", ISBN 0918371074.Another excellent sound reference is the Yamaha Sound Reinforcement Handbook, from Hal Leonard (# HL 00500964). A littl e more detailed than the above recommended book, but still good for both beginners and experts.$LABEL$0

Reasonable sound, but need a bit of power in your reciever.. I purchased these for my cabin in MT for outdoor listening by our camp fire...about 25 yards away from location. Reviews were quite high so I decided to go for it. I think the sound is fairly accurate with good mid range and lows for inexpensive speakers, but these do require a bit of power to drive...I had Polk audio speakers earlier, and they only required half the volume. Overall, I am pleased, but maybe need a more powerful reciever than my old Yamaha...$LABEL$1

good for the most part, but could be better.. i love built to spill, always have. the problem is, i've never liked live albums. it always seems like a "had to be there" affair. this album doesn't feel that way because the production is so good. really. i'm sure you've heard the songs, as most people who buy this will know who built to spill are, so i won't talk about what songs are good. the only complaint is that it could use more early material. oh well...$LABEL$1
There Is A Difference In Prducts. Beware. The tag on the product I received listed it as Fine Texture. There was no mention of that on the Amazon order screen.

One word: BORING. Superstar is one of the worst songs I have ever heard!! It is beyond boring..it is not Rubens fault..the version is too slow and there is too much time with just instrumentals. Flying Without Wings is a good song but Rubens version is nothing special. Don't waste your money on it.$LABEL$0
Disappointed. This book was a great disappointment to me. I love books that have a real setting and yet there is a touch of magic thrown in. Christopher Moore is a master at this type of narrative. He makes you feel as though YOU could stumble onto something mythical in your day to day life. "The Tooth Fairy" did not deliver this. This was a sexually twisted piece of writing. The book might have been more enjoyable if it had just given in to its erotic fixation fully and quit trying to be a creepy coming of age story. At the end of the book I had nothing invested in the story or the characters. The only reason I finished it was a misguided hope that the ending would reveal SOMETHING.$LABEL$0

A big dissapointment. .......Cool boarders 3 is a lot better than 4.Here are mycomplaints 1. the boards go to ... slow, witch always puts me in 4th place in a race. 2.theres hardly any jumps to do any tricks. 3.coolboarders 3 starts you off with about 3 courses, and like maybe 6 or 7 players I think,just untill you do the tournement and unlock them all.And like a couple boards to choose from.cool boarders 4 only starts you off with 2 courses, and 2 players, and probably like 3 boards,............ I found it getting aggravating and boring fast.Lucky I got to take the game back and trade it in with the store I bought it at,After that I bought cool boarders 3, the better one.Where the boards go faster,u start off with more than two coarses,players,and boards.And you get big jumps to.So don't waste your money on this buy the 3rd one instead.$LABEL$0
Warm and cozy. Its a bit overrated and overpriced, but uggs classic boots are super warm and cozy to wear. I do like the tall boots because of the fold down looks that you can get out of one boot.

I love this CD!!. After watching the movie, "Armegeddon", I was afraid that the soundtrack would not live up to the movie. Well, I definitely was wrong for this is one of the best soundtracks I own. I loved the movie and I loved the soundtrack equally. Aerosmith did a great job with "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" and "What Kind of Love Are You On". I also enjoyed Shawn Colvin's "When the Rainbow Comes", Jon Bon Jovi's "Mister Big Time", Patty Smyth's "Wish I Were You", and especially "Animal Crackers". Last but not least, Chantal Kreviazuk's "Leaving on a Jet Plane" brought tears to my eyes. All in all, this is a wonderful CD and I would recommend it to anyone.$LABEL$1

New Benchmark. If you like superb video and audio and appreciate classical music genius, this is the ultimate disc for you. If you own 1080p video and at least moderately good multichannel audio equipment, you are in for a treat. The performance is flawless and the vediophile and audiophile experience is without peer. Even the camerawork and the shots of the hall are breathtaking. This disc sets the bar at a new high level for those of us who are looking not only for the best performances from the best of the best but stunning video and audio technology This disc is a must have. My only regret is that it makes the rest of my library a little disappointing. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!$LABEL$1
ERROR PRONE and no source files. Upfront, in defense of the authors, I will admit that buying the book in 2003 does put it at a disadvantage. That said... The book was obviously "thrown together" with more mistakes than I have ever run into.. especially in the source code. Example: The book references both "the CD included" and a web site to download the files - NEITHER OF WHICH EXIST. The source code listed in the book is full of errors. On the positive side, I've found it to be useful as an introduction to animated graphics; however, if you are a newbie to java, forget it!$LABEL$0

Not even close to Saving Private Ryan!. I am a WWII vet, 1st all-filipino infantry regiment, U.S Army, trained at Fort Ord, Monterey Ca. 1942. Although I was not in the European Theater, I fought in the Pacific, Thin Red Line does not come close to Saving Private Ryan in any aspect of war. Losing many friends on the field and dealing with war itself is something I cannot describe. Watching Private Ryan is as close as you can get to REAL combat. The thin red line is a good movie that takes war in a different perspective, but please do not compare it to a great movie like Saving Private Ryan.$LABEL$0

It was ok..... Would you try another book from C.E. Murphy and/or Gabra Zackman?I think I'll pass on both of them.Would you ever listen to anything by C.E. Murphy again?C.E. Murphy wrote a romance book and that is what it is. I wouldn't think C.E. Murphy would want to change anything. It fit the book that C.E. Murphy was trying for.What didn't you like about Gabra Zackman's performance?It was a very flat performance. Very dry.Any additional comments?It was to more romance and not enough Urban Fantasy for me.$LABEL$0

insanity. This Movie makes us think that we can change ourselves and this is a very dangerous philosophy. If we believe we can change ourselves then we believe we can change others. thus putting us in grave danger of becoming tyrants and self serving, ego maniacs. The only thing that can truly change anyone is, the savior Jesus Christ. We must wash our minds with scripture and let God transform our lives, only then can we receive what our hearts truly desire.$LABEL$0
Boring and predictable. There is nothing new nor interesting in this book. Liberace was gay. Really? Gosh, I didn't know that. Sinatra could be mean. Who'd a thunk? People had parties at their houses where lord only knows what went on because the parties were on private property. Oh, heaven forbid. At least some of the photos were nice.$LABEL$0

One of the coolest ps1 games. This game rocks. A must have.The monsters are cool.The graphics and scene's are even cooler. I recommend it.Gave it 5 stars.I played it for hours and hours on end.Good luck finding it though$LABEL$1
What's up with all the 5 stars???. There are only 2 humorous things about this book: The book title and the chapter titles. I read through the book thinking "ok, was that supposed to be funny?". I kept reading though, cause I never give up on a book until I finish it. But this one has no redemption. It's a waste of your money and time even if you're reading it while taking a potty.$LABEL$0
WASTE OF TIME!. For being one of the most popular movies of its kind, it really was a big waste of time. I never new a Steve McQueen movie could be so overrated until I saw this. I had never seen the movie until last week, and boy was I dissapointed. All these years of hearing and reading all the hype, for nothing. I admit I was convinced it was good even before I saw it, again, I was wrong. It is not that thrilling or suspensfull. I know it was based on the true story, and I admire the real POWs for everything they endured, but this movie does them a disservice by trying to make it funny at times. Not admirable. Don't waste your money, just rent it if you want to see it. Forgetable after its over and done with.$LABEL$0
Sound advice from a true sleep specialist!. My son didn't start sleeping through the night until he was 19 months old. That was when we started seeing Dr. Mindell.

Agony. There is little to do with the Enemy in this movie... It doesn't tell us to hate the American, or to pity the noble Japanese. The enemy was greed, war, disease, and apathy... so many children suffered in this long, terrible war, we can't ever atone for it. This movie is not some sword-wielding, prophecy-fulfilling anime, it is of agony, love, trust, family, and sorrow so deep that one cannot express it.I don't know about you, but this film crushed me, I couldn't stop crying for hours.... It let me never want to see war again.$LABEL$1

Certainly not clockwork or an amazing process, but very effective apparently.. My daughter is older (11), but very petite. Bedwetting has been a very tough lingering issue for us, as she has a very small bladder and is a very deep sleeper. She wore it 3 times. The first time it did not work for some reason. The next couple, it kind of did. Although it certainly wasn't the picture perfect buzzer goes off, so she goes to the bathroom scenario. Honestly at the time I didn't think it worked, and that I had bought a lemon of a product. But, the couple of times it buzzed her awake seems to have done the trick.All in all I bought it so that she would stop bedwetting on the advice of her pediatrician. She has completely stopped now for a couple of months. So I have to rate this product a 5 star for coming through on it's claims. Certainly not clockwork or an amazing process, but very effective apparently.$LABEL$1
Not good. I'm a Boston fan from way back. It seems as though with each album they've made, it gets worse as time goes by. I'm at a loss for why, too. Scholz wrote most of the music back in the "old days" and Fran Cosmo sounds creepily like Brad Delp (for the most part). But this outing is far below par. Far below. The best song on here is Cryin'. It really sounds like they should sound. Cryin' is really a good song. The rest, to me, is filler.Also, all the feel-good environmental, save-the-animals stuff plastered all over the booklet is a big turn off. It comes off as some left-wing baloney to me. I'm all for protecting the environment and unnecessary slaughter of animals, but they go too far in the cd booklet.Of course, those that read this and disagree will have all kinds of nasty things to say. But that's the hallmark of the left today. Disagree with them and they WILL attack.I'm Libertarian, btw, for all the kooks' knowledge.$LABEL$0
For the birds!!!!. The only reason for buying this book is if you own a bird because it will be usefull for lining the bottom of the cage.

Christmas gift. The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product, but rather the company that I purchased them from. I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift. Unfortunately, they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place, so he was unable to wear them, and since they were an online order item, it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return. The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label, so my son could return the original pair. When I spoke to my son last week, he had not yet received the return label. I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item. I am very unhappy with this purchase.$LABEL$0

Ageless. I am 60 years old, but because of good genes I look quite a bit younger than my age. When I wear Bare Minerals foundation I find people staring at me - their reason is "You look amazing.

Not what I expected!. This HD radio is not what I expected at all. The reception is terrible even with the antennas that were included. I've had a chance to hear other HD radios and this one is very below standards. After 6 months use, my remote has buttons that no longer work. I'd return it but it's not worth the trouble. Live and learn. I give it a rare, "DON'T BUY THIS ITEM"!$LABEL$0
Worked very well for me. I was somewhat surprised to see this trap rated so poorly because I had very good luck with it. It was the third kind I tried and I the first my mice weren't able to outsmart. Caught the whole family living in my garage over the course of a couple of months (one at a time of course). I agree with the reviewer who said you do need a hard, level, flat surface (like my concrete garage floor) for them to work properly. Also, Re: the person who said that they don't always lock shut, a tiny squirt of WD-40 on the yellow plastic tab completely eliminated that problem. They get a 4/5 only because they are a pain to clean out after each use (bait + frightened mouse = lots of pooping & peeing). Also need to get that mouse out quickly because they will overheat in such a small space and die, missing the point of a humane trap.$LABEL$1
A Great Read. This is my first book by this author and I found it well written and its story interesting, exciting and occasionally humorous. Unnecessarily vulgar, it's true, but once you've accepted that, most entertaining. I will now look at some of her other books. If you don't mind a lot of X-rated language, I would certainly recommend it.$LABEL$1
Brings in the waist, but that's about all.. This bra is fantastic for wearing under vintage clothing, when you're going for that bullet bra look. It brings in the waist and provides that lovely rib-cage shaping so vital for 50s "new look" dresses. However, it offers very little in the way of cup support and nothing in the way of the kind of cup molding that is common with modern brassieres. This means that the wear one can get from this undergarment is very limited, particularly for small-busted ladies.$LABEL$1
Nice typeface. I like the typeface that the publisher uses here, but beyond that, there is little good I can say about this book. It's boring. The author does little to intergrate her discussions of different aspects of the geography of Mexico. It's just like, Here are the Pyramids...Bam! Here are some folk dancers.And then there's this little piece of propaganda..."...the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This agreement made it easier and less expensive for Mexico to trade goods with its North American neighbors."No discussion beyond that. then bam! on to Fiestas, Music, and Arts!$LABEL$0

Affordable, straightforward. Bought and installed the two-bike version. For an inexpensive item, I have no complaints. Certainly, it's only as sturdy as your wall-mount point (since the spine is assembled from several shorter square pipe segments, it would not hold vertical by itself, even if bike weight were well balanced). If I had my druthers, it would not hang the bikes quite as far out from the wall (a road bike or kids bike only needs 10-inch arm for hook, and this is longer), but it's a one-size-fits-all solution, and will handle even fairly wide mountain bars easily.$LABEL$1

Had know idea what it was about.. I watched this movie because someone else recommended it and said it was "profound". What was profound about it for me is how eastern, mystical, religious thought packaged for western society via a movie can come across as it so often does. Touching, yet missing the mark when it comes to truth. Nevertheless, the acting was good and there were some touching scenes trying to proselytize the audience with its message.$LABEL$0
A big no-no. OK, there are times you want to relax by watching something easy and entertaining, so you go for a movie with a bit of this'n'that: action, violence, humor, romance. This was my premise when choosing this movie. I was hoping for very uncomplicated fun, with some mystery, action, intrigue, romance, etc. Let's face it, we might love gourmet cuisine, but every once in a while a hotdog sounds really good. Well, this hotdog was a real dog. Sure, this is a straightforward movie, with an easy to follow plot, and with many of the ingredients listed above, but the end result was bad. Wesley Snipes is such a talented actor, and somehow he gets these roles where he is a thuggy good guy, decent but not very bright, getting in trouble (as usual). Alan Alda was disappointing as the National Security Advisor. The only refreshing character was Dennis Miller almost playing himself. But in summary, this movie was way too lame and predictable, better left on the shelves.$LABEL$0
If Sleepy was SMART, he's re-release... This CD is phenomenal. I find it HARD to go a day without listening to it. Why this wasn't re-relased, I have NO idea. If you like Outkast, but prefer something more laid back, plese pick this up. You will NOT be disappointed.$LABEL$1
Dangerously In Love More Like Dangerous In Skills. Beyonce Giselle Knowles, showcased her writing skills, her vocals, parts that she has not shown the world. This CD is worth 10 stars. It is on the same level as Aaliyah's Aaliyah CD. Her collaborations are perfect. Missy Elliot did a good song, Signs. And the Luther duet, Closer I Get To You, was sung much better by these two than Donnie And Roberta. Her ballads, and her uptempo songs balance out with giving u enough of both. Speechless, to me that is the best song on the album, its sexy and it is just the .... All in All, this is a CD for 03 & 04. U did ur thang Beyonce. Im so happy 4 u. U representin Texas. Bee~$LABEL$1
Good idea, bad product. I bought this clock for my 9-year old. The sound quality is so poor that it's difficult to understand both my son's self-recorded wake up message, and the clocks pre-recorded time announcement. The volume is so loud we put the clock in a drawer when our baby is napping (in another room). Additionally, the clock is supposed to announce the time if you clap. However, it announces the time in response to all sorts of noises, such as "THREE EIGHTEEN AM" when my son rolls over in bed. High points for durability because I've "accidently" knocked it off the dresser, top bunk etc. several times and it keeps ticking. Skip it.$LABEL$0
Don't trust this company.. Placed an order plenty of time before Christmas. Was never told the order would not arrive in time. In fact, the order NEVER DID ARRIVE. It was cancelled automatically by Amazon a month after being ordered due to "lack of inventory". Which raises the question: if there is no inventory, why is the item posted at all? Baffling. Good to see I am not the only person who has had trouble with this company.$LABEL$0

B-side myself. I can't believe that the Beatles had the nerve to release such a load of garbage. As a Beatles fan, it hurts me. I felt nauseaous the first time I listened to this album all the way through. There are 30 songs on the White Album. Maybe three of them are of the usual, high Beatles quality. I'm so sick and tired of bands releasing albums that aren't worthy of themselves. And the Beatles started it all with this travesty. Songs like "Good Night" and "Long, Long, Long" have no business being on anything except a b-sides album. It's shocking that they ever released this whole thing. Beatles fans shouldn't even bother to defend this album. We should stand as far back from it as possible. Oh, well. Obladi, Oblada, life goes on. But if you want a real double album, check out the Smashing Pumpkins' "Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness."$LABEL$0

Reversal on previous review. Got the lamp a few weeks ago and was amazed at the "new" picture...it was bright and crisp. Also commented on how easy it was to install.

Better than Vanilla Ice. I'll be nice.Relative to a pool of vomit, this album is pretty solid. I'd rather have this album thrown at me at high speeds than a chainsaw. If I was stranded on a desert island, I'd rather have this album than a tumor. If I had to lick something, I'd rather it be this album than, say, a ferret's balls. At my next birthday party, I'd much rather you sing than a man that could make Earth explode with his voice. If I needed a drinking buddy, I'd rather it be you than someone with an uncontrollable bladder that also happens to be a recovering alcoholic whose wife is only giving him one last chance before she kicks him out of the house and takes his kids, that being the final straw before he flips out and murder's my grandfather.$LABEL$0

easy read. Ok, this book has its plusses and minusses. The plusses:great info, preseted in a easy to read and comprehensive fashion. It covers quite a bit in regards to the effect of insulin and simple sugars on body fat. The author also does a nice job explaining how exactly to follow a low carb diet as well as how to follow a high carb, very low fat diet.The minus: He's a little hedgy here in that he never really gives his opinions regarding what fat loss plan is best or ideal. He leaves that up to the reader to make his own decision. While I can appreciate he may have wanted to cover several topics and to leave the choice open to the reader, I think, with his knowledge in the field, he has done the reader an injustice by not being exactly clear which diet is best.Overall, enjoyed the book, was pleased and impressed and am putting a "strong buy" recommendation on it.$LABEL$1

One of the best books I have read in many years.. I knew Don from when he was a young man. He is a deep and thoughtful person, and this is reflected in his writing.

Scratched. The disk for this movie was so scratched that it messed up the playback of the movie and skipped over parts. It's not too bad that it's completely discouraging though, so I still watch it.

Great Value. I really like the classic look of this double-boiler. I had been looking for some time as I wanted to learn to make the German sweet rice my grandmother made.

Karnataka - Strange Behaviour. This is the most amazing cd I have ever bought.The only other Karnataka cd I have is The Gathering Light which I enjoyed so I thought I would check out the back catalogue and where better to start than a double live album. I'm not into technical reviews and talking about mixes and production and stuff but this is truly an amazing cd. It is long enough that it can stay in the car for a week at a time and will not become one of those that you thrash for a few days and then never play again. As they say 'all thrill, no fill'. Each track has it's star performer. To truly enjoy it a good pair of headphones and a couple of hours kicking back is recommended. Can't wait to get the studio albums these tracks came from.$LABEL$1

Not a good buy. When I first tried the mic would pick up everything except my voice. Eventually it finally started working all right.There's a huge static problem with them.

Superb Sequel. The first book was one of a kind...until the second came along and finished the story. Dinotopia: The World Beneath is a must have for anyone who has read the first book. There are new adventures, amazing new discoveries, plenty of exciting action and a satisfying conclusion to everything. The illustrations are just as spectacular as they were the first time and the story does not dilute itself one bit. I urge you to find yourself a copy of this book, and also a copy of the original if you have not read that either; both are amazing books meant for all ages.$LABEL$1
a Brit-pop masterpiece!. As a huge sleeper fan,I anxiously awaited the follow up to their brilliant album "The It Girl."When I read that the new album was a flop and was not even being released in the U.S.,I was determined to buy the record (as Import) and decide for myself.After all ,most rock critics are total losers and love to slag this band for whatever reason.When the record arrived I put it on and within about 5 seconds of the opening track "Please,Please,Please"I knew my faith in the band was well placed.I feel this is the best Sleeper record to date.Fans of bands like Blur and Elastica would probably like this.Standout tracks "Traffic Accident","Rollercoaster"and "Firecracker" are Sleeper at their absolute best.$LABEL$1
Solid Gaming Mouse Choice. While there isn't anything above and beyond with this mouse, it does work really well. I'm very happy with my decision to buy it.I have no idea why people have described it at "slippery". "Slippery" is not a word I would use to describe a mouse. There is some smooth plastic on it, but this isn't a wet bar of soap we are talking about here. I don't know how most people hold on to a mouse, but usually the weight of my hand keeps it in place. I'm not constantly struggling to keep a grip on it.As for the actual performance, the scroll wheel is smooth and the buttons near the thumb are nice. The control with the mouse is nice and precise and the ability to change the sensitivity on the fly with the provided buttons is pretty great as well.$LABEL$1
Really really boring - yuk!. Ray Liotta has been in some bad movies, but this one ranks right up there among the very worst. Some reviewers enjoyed the love story, but these two would-be star-crossed lovers were incredibly unappealing to me and dull. This film didn't work for me on either level - boring love story or boring revenge story. I usually enjoy even the bad Ray Liotta movies because he can be so delightfully crazy, but he isn't quite crazy enough in this one even though he's the bad guy (he does make an attempt toward the end to come through, but it's too late by then - anybody who has stuck with the movie this far, doesn't really care by now.). If you really want a star-crossed lover's tale, surely you can dig up something more exciting than this one; and there are definitely better revenge plots out there than this one. I wanted to smack Alan and Ella by the end of the movie for being such sappy idiots. They deserve each other.$LABEL$0
Maybe two stars is too many. I found this book, or these two books to be very poorly written. There is no depth to these stories. At one point the heroine stumbles into a cabin in the middle of the woods and eats for two days straight. Where did the food come from?The characters in this book seem completely unphased by the totally unbelievable things that happen to them. Character development is below average and each event seems like a bridge from one lifleless coincindence to the next.Oh, and the endings are boring... . For good fantasy of the female genre try JV Jones.$LABEL$0
Webkinz toys. My preteen granddaughter is the "user" of this product, and loves it. She is a budding collector, and is taking good care of the product.

Excited, then disappointed. Thought I had gotten a deal, but upon using the nailer, it jammed right away and continued to do so. I did like how the safety was behind the nailer, but the plastic rack must not have had the tolerances for the nails. Last jam, the nail went behind the movable rack and was impossible to get out. Eventually, trying take the rack of ended up breaking a plastic piece, rendering the gun inoperable. Too bad.$LABEL$0
Rethink this one. Although it's based on an interesting concept--that of short-term memory loss--I have difficulty understanding why anyone likes this film. It's very violent, plus the nature of the story requires the same scenes to be played over and over. Enough already! We got the point! The same point could be made in a much more interesting fashion. The production was fine, but overall I found this film to be a real downer.$LABEL$0
good deal. Both lights are insanely bright. I'm almost afraid to use them. The headlight does an okay job lighting the path ahead, could be better but is adequate. The taillight does an almost better job of lighting the path behind you. Bright!Would (and have) suggest to a friend.$LABEL$1
Where's The Plot?. This Boring movie goes nowhere; it has no plot and I could barely sit through it. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidmans worst role ever! Maybe this movie hit a little to close to home for the both of them. Too bad Stanley Kubrick couldnt have made a better movie before he died. The whole movie is about fantasy and desire and sex with other partners and them thinking about cheating on eachother. This movie was degrading and a waste of my time!$LABEL$0
Definitely one of my all time favorite books. Even after many years, The Ginger Tree remains one of my all time favorite books. I enjoyed everything about it--the fact that it was written in diary form, the fact that it takes place in a Japan long gone, the fact that it is a very poignant love story. I recommend this book most highly.$LABEL$1
Excellent contribution to the 1990s rock-blues!. This band is hot. If you like SRV and the stylings of other Texas guitarists, then this CD is for you. Though Indigenous draws definite influence from these bands (as well as greats like Jimi Hendrix), they are unique. Mato Nanji has to rank as one of the best guitarists in the country, and his unique voice adds a new flavor to blues-rock. The band has a lot of promise, and, just so you know, this CD is only a hint of their talent. You should see them live!! Wow, what a performance. . . .$LABEL$1

NOT THIS ONE.. The first volume is very good but not this one. Basically it's the original versions of all the songs that METALLICA cover on GARAGE INC.The first volume makes one solid collection, and though this one has some killer tunes its a disoriented mix. Songs like TUESDAYS GONE, which I love, Lynyrd Skynyrd rocks, but it doesn't fit here.The first disc is the stuff that was underground when METALLICA was coming up the ranks. Its the stuff you'd expect to hear. The stuff that mom hates and it makes your ears bleed.The second has LOVERMAN by Nick Cave and the Seeds.WHile it isn't bad, it just seems to me like a way to make more money. I'm not sure I like the whole concept of this thing anyway. I mean, its not like these bands aren't awesome on their own. Do we really need to stamp Metallica's now pretty bogus name on a collection of songs that really has nothing to do with them? I don't really understand.Buy a MOTORHEAD CD, and you'll feel a lot better about yourself.$LABEL$0
A pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.... If you liked Steve Martin's movie, A Simple Twist of Fate, (he adapted the screenplay) then you will probably like this book. It was a fast easy read. I blew through it in a couple of hours on a plane. An interesting story about being alone in a world full of beautiful people, when you don't feel so beautiful yourself. The emotional rollercoaster of day to day life, when you wonder if the anti-depressants are still working and a coming of age story for all three of the main characters. It's a different side of Steve Martin, his intellegence and wit shines. It's a curl up on the sofa and waste a rainy afternoon kind of book.$LABEL$1
Surrealistic and Whimsical. Yoshimoto's style isn't for everyone -- her writing is simple and straightforward, and these qualities too often aren't given the credit they deserve. Somehow she manages to use this method to tell stories from the unusual to the bizarre to the magical -- and in so doing brings elements of metaphysics or science fiction into the everyday. The second story in this book is a fairy tale, but one that uses the trappings of ordinary life to illustrate a near-universal experience; I think it's one of the most moving short stories I've ever read.$LABEL$1
An excellent microwave oven,with a jet black retro look.. This microwave oven performs very well...My previous microwave was also a panasonic,but lost power after 5 years.

My balls are damaged.... I ordered a pair of the medium iron baoding balls several weeks ago as a gift for my boyfriend. Although they shipped and arrived quite promptly, the box was of poor quality and the baoding balls themselves were damaged. They appeared to be used, with scratches and even nicks in the balls. As each ball was wrapped individually and nestled into the fitted box, these damages could not have resulted from shipping.I am disappointed and am now back to searching for another gift I can get to replace these.$LABEL$0
Epson 3200 and Software Review. I found the Epson 3200 to be an excellent upgrade from my Epson 1640. The Epson twain and the Smart Panel software worked without any problems and the scans are great. What would improve their software is to provide a PDF file for the User Guide instead of the HTM file. What I was disappointing in was the SilverFast software. After changing a few settings the software stopped working altogether. LaserSoft, the company that makes SilverFast, does not provide any non-chargeable phone support for installation problems. Many companies offer a 30-day free installation support but not LaserSoft. Fortunately, I found a software upgrade on the Internet but it does make one wonder about quality control. Also, I found their manuals difficult to read. It appears that they were written by engineers and embellished by product management. A good technical writer and editor could certainly improve the documentation.$LABEL$1
Inaccurate - useless.. Great concept, but it's not accurate. My daughter clearly has a fever. She is burning up, flushed cheeks, clammy. The thermometer first said 94.6. Then it said 100.3. Then it said 95.2. Then it said 97.3. And then it said 96.5. That's a huge range of temps. I cannot rely on this thermometer and would urge you to find another brand. This is useless and has since been returned.$LABEL$0
Revolting stuff. Anyone interested in the revolting history of Christian anti-Semitism can find one of the founding documents here. I am amazed that two people posted reviews of this book and didn't even mention the truly disgusting language and images employed by this so-called "Saint." In fact, the latest edition of the works of the "Fathers of the Church" simply omits these homilies because they are so repellent.$LABEL$0
nothing like the cover. As a fan of lowbrow art as well as mark ryden's work, this book is nothing of either.The cover is awesome and i expected something along that line of art in the book an was let down.

MY GRADE: C minus to C.. One of Bob Hope's not so funny flicks. Typically I liked his humor but not this time around. I struggled through it for about 40 minutes. Humor is dated. Fail. WHEN WATCHED: end of November 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C minus to C.$LABEL$0

Ultra Mouse MISSING THE "ULTRA". Before Gyration Inc. can compete in the Mouse & Keyboard arena, they must learn to design products that are COMPLETELY in sync with Windows! I even took extra steps in downloading all drivers needed from the Gyration Website, but this slick and very design driven package still couldn't give an "Ultra Performance". The Keyboard would sometimes read and sometimes not...and the mouse would force Windows to crash! It's too bad, I wanted it to work. I guess I should stick to the "Old School Products" with more experience.$LABEL$0
traditional music made special. I heard this CD on NPR. I prefer the more obscure Christmas songs because I kinda get tired of traditional songs by the end of Christmas.These are traditional songs made fresh by the instruments and arrangements. Love the mandolin and in this CD it does not sound...plinky (?) This CD sounds folksy or Appalachian-thats ok with me too. If you like really unusual songs- folk singing. Try Winter's Grace.Winter's GraceI think it goes well with this CD.$LABEL$1

Long-distance hike through knee-deep mud. I couldn't wait to get this book after reading the reviews. I'm a lover of serious literature. I was disappointed to find the characters loathsome and tedious. I need at least one person in a story whom I like and am rooting for. I didn't even feel compassion for these people. They are so infuriatingly self-destructive, irresponsible, selfish, and emotionally lazy.The story itself was long, slow and unengaging. I dragged myself through it in hopes of a pay-off in the end, but the "corrections" were skimpy, simplistic, and left me frustrated and irritable. The writing itself was pretentious and tiresome. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.Franzen seems skilled and smart, but defeated by his own self-consciousness. I hope to see better from him.$LABEL$0
DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!. This is probably the worst tax software I have every purchased. I've been using TurboTax and TaxCut for years and this year I have had nothing but problems from the state program and the Federal.For one, there are "fixes" that won't download. Everytime I do, the program crashes during installation.I am hoping that I get a refund from Amazon for the $89 I spent on the TaxCut Complete for Home & Business (same problem by the way) and the 24.50 I spent on the state program.I'm always going to purchase TurboTax from now on because the technical support at for this product blows. All they did was tell me the same stupid thing over and over again (in other words, they had no idea what to do!) ($9.95 for calls to get tech support, isn't that nice?)$LABEL$0

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!. The movie on the second disc is billed as the original theatrical release. This is only partly true. It was shown in 1977, but this was after it was cut to a commercial length. I am not a die hard purist, so don't get this wrong. However, the movie I loved was the one that existed prior to the commercial cut late in 1977. The moments with the character "Biggs" is an important part of the story, now lost. It supports Lukes longing to leave, but it also shows his longing for someone to look up to. Without these scenes this simply isn't the movie I loved-the initial release of Star Wars before it was cut to commercial length. I guess George Lucas just doesn't care about those of us who cherished the first release, which sadly now no longer exists for those who desire to see it. Shame on you Mr. Lucas!!Moral: Don't waste your money!$LABEL$0

Highly recommend this stapler for heavy duty use.. We are a blueprint shop and have 4 offices. We do a lot of stapling of blueprints and this is the only stapler that holds the test of time and takes the abuse we put it through. If you have a lot of heavy duty stapling to do then this is your stapler. We have gone through a lot of them over the years but it's more how we use the stapler than the quality of it.We aren't crazy about the Bostitch staples though and usually purchase the heavy duty swingling staples as the bostitch tend to break easily.$LABEL$1

Good stuff. I've been using this for a year now and just love it, I have had no problems no matter what amount I use, but it can be a bit strong tasting if you use more then a light to med sprinkle on foods. I spinkle it on deviled eggs instead of paprika, soooo good! And sprinkle it on tofu, baked potatos, hot rice, Japanese noodles, I've added it to soups, stir frys and will find more ways to use it, I'm sure.If you don't like seaweed don't get it, because thats what it is, so that is what it tastes like!$LABEL$1
comic masterwork.. I've read a few of Barth's books and this one standsout for sheer entertainment value and laughs. I thinkBarth has an original satirical mind but you mightnot agree.The book is long - and I'm a little averse to long novels.I dislike getting into a book and discovering thatI'm far from finishing and not enjoying it much - yetstill feeling somehow committed. I did not have thisproblem with The Sot-Weed Factor.Even right now I am reading an 800 page novel by one ofour great American writers... I'm halfway through itand wondering if anything interesting is going to happen,contemplating shelving the book and the writer can keephis secrets!You might find this book pompous and self-indulgent. Ididn't think on that too much. I just found it funny.I've read a lot of less-entertaining and less thought-provoking books. Chances are if you have a permissive,indulgent sense of humor you'll get a kick out of thisone.$LABEL$1
Bring on the Ice Cream!. It works. You need it if you're going to make your own ice cream cones with a pizelle maker. It's made of wood, rather than plastic (and metal would heat up). Not much else to say.$LABEL$1
Don't bother reading this book unless you have a lot of time. This book was very boring unless you're into composers and very familiar with movements, symphonies, etc. Also, I found that I had to read almost half the book to really understand and define the characters. The premise at the end that the two would actually be clever enough for each to give the other poison and kill each other was absolutely absurd. This is the first McEwan work I've read and I'm not sure I'll read another.$LABEL$0
Not Streaks. Spray works well on HDTV as well as computer screens. There were no streaks or smudges on my 48" TV when I finished cleaning it, and the brush, which actually pulls down into it's sleeve, helps get rid of dust before using the product. My only complaint is the cleaning cloth, which is fairly rough.$LABEL$1
weak. I bought this sharpener for very cheap and soon learned why. The pencil got sharp, but the motor almost quit trying to do it. It looks nice, sleek, kinda like a mouse.

What's the Point?. I honestly thought that this book by Steinbeck is pointless. It is so short, it really has not plot at all! Yes, it does show the value of friendship, and offers plenty of bookgroup discussion, but I was not thrilled. It really was much too short to go anywhere.$LABEL$0
Buen album. Este nuevo álbum, es el undécimo de su ya larga carrera. Si A toda esa gente cerraba un ciclo del grupo, Tánger hace que comience uno nuevo.Grabado a caballo entre Madrid y la propia ciudad magrebí, este nuevo trabajo es fruto de la investigación y estudio de las diferentes culturas musicales que, desde sus comienzos, ha centrado la base de la trayectoria musical de Medina Azahara. Son las raíces árabes, andaluzas y magrebíes las que, en mezcla perfecta con la vanguardia del rock, conforman la base de la música de fusión que siempre ha caracterizado al grupo. Estos son los temas del álbum:Danza al Viento, Como un sueño, Un instante junto a ti, Solo un camino, Regalarte una estrella, El lento atardecer, Confusión y realidad, Cuando se pierde el amor, Loco por ti, Deja de llorar, Tiempo de Abril, Solamente mía y Miénteme.El álbum ha sido disco de oro.$LABEL$1

Slice and Dice Editing. The Amazon reviewer called the editing on this DVD "slice and dice editing", I would call it "very bad editing". I really liked the show and would have liked to have watched it but the rapid fire editing made it maddening. In most of the concert footage the scene changes were as quick as every one second and rarely did a shot last longer than two seconds. So your jerking around so much you can't watch the show. It is very distracting!$LABEL$0

Crossroads of BORING!. I am extremely disappointed with this book. Robert Jordan has merely produced 700 pages of filler without furthering the story. It was not exciting. In fact, it was dull. The wheel of time did not turn at all with this installment. How much more nothing can I take? Jordan is just producing words to cash in on the readers that fell in love with the beginning of the series. "There are neither beginnings, nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time." How true...$LABEL$0
Great purchase. The ER6i earphones are excellent. They have good sound qualities for the extremely small size. The noise reduction is excellent as well allowing me to have music playing at a reduced level when outside noise is high (such as running a lawn mower)and still enjoy the music. I would highly recommend these earphones to everyone.$LABEL$1
title doesn't do the book justice. The title makes it sound like a clone of Atkins, but it's not. I think this is unfortunate, because the book gets lost in a sea of diet books. As a diet book, this isn't the best, but this is much more than just a diet book. There is some overlap in information, but Dr. Ullis puts much more emphasis on exercise with even a section of illustrated strength training exercises. Atkins and other low carb diets are about keeping insulin levels down to burn fat. Ullis talks about that, but also about balancing all your hormones for improved health, longer life, and to reverse the affects of aging. Unfortunately, he doesn't go into the technical details as much as I would like (which accounts for the deduction of one star), but there are definitely some good things to learn about this book. Ullis emphasizes not only what to eat and how to exercise, but also timing. So, I think this is a worthwhile read.$LABEL$1
Pleased. Received the book in a timely manner, and it is in like new condition. Will recommend this seller to others.$LABEL$1

I wish I read these reviews before buying this Piece of.... My brother purchased 2 of these DVD Players. One for himeself, and one which he gave to me as a christmas gift in December of 2001. Today Less than 1 year later both units are DEAD.Both units exhibited the same symptoms. The first thing we noticed was that the display was dead, other than that it seemed to be reading the DVD fine. Well after the copyright warnings, and production logos we quickly realized that there was no sound either.Several email correspondence with Toshiba tech support have been fruitless. I will get NOTHING AND LIKE IT!If this is how they stand behind their products I will never be buying another product bearing the Toshiba name.It is unfortunate that all of the satisfied users who have not had their DVD Players long enough to experience this problem have already left 5 star feedback. It makes for an artifically high overall review.$LABEL$0

Not a good value at $999. Although Amazon offers this CBT at almost $300 less than buying direct, PC Age does not justify $1000 for this CBT that is low on features like printing, keyboard functions, etc. I have also purchased SYBEX and MS Press study kits, a much better investment. Difficult to navigate through this training and the only thing that you can print is your test score. The tests lack clarity and accuracy. Many sources out there for less money. This CBT is the equivalent of a PowerPoint presentation with NO print functions.$LABEL$0
I didn't get to enjoy it. I was very sad that the item that I was so looking forward to decorating my kitchen with arrived in many pieces.

Terrible. Unfortunately this book was my introduction to LeGuin and I don't think I will ever be able to read anything else she's done because of it. I'll keep the review simple; The Telling was pretentious, plotless and without character development. I also got the impression that LeGuin was feeling pretty clever when she wrote it. It comes across as a mere outline for a novel; unfinished and exceptionally boring to the point that I could not bring myself to finish it. Please don't start here as I'm sure her other works MUST be better than this based on her reputation.$LABEL$0

Kill Uncle. Kill Uncle being Morrissey's 1991 release and his second studio album is very different and unconventional compared to his earlier releases. The lyrics are quite introspective and songs that stand out are "Our Frank", "Sing your life" and "There Is a Place in Hell for Me and My Friends". The book-let is quite spars but very nice with a nice clear photo of Morrissey and the lyrics are included with an easy to read font. It even has information of whom plays what on the album. 4/5.$LABEL$1

The Return of The King. "The Lord of the Ring" The Return of the King is one of the best book I've ever read. It had me jumping of my seat, and I wondered if the movie can match up to the book.

Hoover Widepath vacuum - disappointing. I purchased this vacuum via Amazon because it was recommended by a well-known consumer rating magazine, and was affordable. It does have good suction and is very lightweight. However, the belt breaks very easily because there is no way to turn off the suction quickly if something large is accidently sucked into the machine. I have had the vacuum for four months, and have had to replace two belts. It also seems almost as if I was sent a used vacuum instead of a new one because the accessory hose was bent, and the first belt and some of the accessories looked worn.$LABEL$0
Returned It. I ordered this kit because I needed the T5 to fix a cell phone. When it arrived the only piece that was defective was the T5! Ugh! Luckily Amazon makes returns easy but unfortunately I'll have to buy from a different vendor.It was as if the bit never got molded and was a solid blank piece and was bigger than the T7. I'll order a different set that's on Amazon and I should be good.I gave it an extra star since it was actually a decent looking kit if I had use for the others.$LABEL$0
A cat lover's delight.. These old stories seem out of time and yet they bring us back to times that were more gentle yet more unforgiving. I really like a sad story by Ugo Ojetti. It is called Mozaffar and Shirbudun. Also I loved The Boy Who Drew Cats by Lafcadio Hearn. It's a little different from what we are used to. It makes it very interesting.$LABEL$1

Be prepared to lose a bunch of rice. Like basically everyone else, I bought this rice cooker to replace an old one, whose non-stick coating was starting to flake. The idea of a stainless steel bowl really appealed to me, but the reality of it is that you're going to lose a lot of rice when cooking a batch.There are a few recommendations for reducing the effect of this, the most helpful being to coat the bowl with oil (I haven't tried a cooking spray yet) prior to adding rice and water, but it won't completely solve the problem and it also affects the taste of the rice.Soaking the bowl overnight does allow for easy cleaning, but it's still a bummer to have a substantial layer of rice go down the sink (or, if you don't have garbage disposal, to be fished out of the strainer and into the trash).This might just be the trade off, for being able to avoid aluminum or non-stick coating, but be prepared for it.$LABEL$0

Just awful , a record for dope freaks and hippys only.. Don't get me wrong, I was once a bit of a gong freak. Steve Hillage was for a few brief years a hero of mine and live he could certainly play his guitar. However Green is terrible and marked my parting of the way with all things gongy and silly.The lyrics are embarrassing, I'm taking utter toss. This albumb was so bad I swapped my limited addition green vinyl version for a couple of joints worth of cheap moroccan ( a much better deal)There is nothing close to the great sound produced during Fish Rising, it just carries on like a Valium induced depression until the final side were we are insulted by the magical ohm riff. After this LP I straighten out a lot and now I cannot tolerate anything vaguely gongy with the exception of camembert electric and fish rising. Do yourself a favour and don't buy this one unless you really are a hopeless bong fiend with no life to go back to.$LABEL$0
not so good.... well, the first THE HULK from some years before is real bad....the story is uninspired, and the film is confuse and silly....well, it's hard to make a movie with a green giant monster that destroy everything and can't speak rational words....this one, THE INCREDIBLE HULK is a little better than THE HULK, but still is not so good...These HULK movies got amazing visual effects, but got uninspired dialogues, characters and story....$LABEL$0

The middle of an amazing trio!. Every song is equally as amazing. I love this single/EP. 3 of B&S's very best songs are on this single/EP.

I'd recomend buying this along with both the Legal Man and I'm Waking Up to Us singles/EPs. 9 of the finest damn Belle & Sebastian songs to be released.$LABEL$1
Shop for this book!. ... If you have ever written a check that bounced, tried to charge something on a card that was over the limit or worried about bills you pretended didn't exist but persist on coming to your doorstep each month, this book will make you giggle in delight. It stars the penniless but charming Rebecca Bloomwood. She's a financial advice guru who is in debt up to her eyeballs but can't pass a store without going in and buying something. I have to say this book had me laughing so hard, I had tears in my eyes and was glad that Rebecca was still struggling with her incessant need to shop after the fairy-tale happy ending of the first novel. (I was worried she'd turn into a nonshopper!!!) Thankfully she's back with more wacky antics. Buy this book or pick it up at the library, it's too funny to miss!$LABEL$1

Nothing really new, but enjoyable. I have to say, some people seem to expect a little too much from their entertainment. Considering that 95% of all anime is based on a ludicrous premise and then pretending it is normal, parent swapping hardly seems that far fetched when compared to giant robots and/or psychic powers. After all, excepting something that isn't normal as an operating truth is kind of the point. I think this series trys to show how easy it is to get confused by emotions. Also, this series made me laugh out loud quite a bit. Although I must admit that I just didn't care about the characters as much as the ones in series like "His and Her Circumstances", "Maison Ikkoku", "Boys Over Flowers", or "Fruit Basket". I would definitely recommend any of these if you have seen one of them and liked it.$LABEL$1
I love it! The look, the price, everything about it!. I just got my comforter set and the first thing I noticed was the softness. It's lucious. As I dressed the bed, it started taking shape and looking better and better. The color moss is a gorgeous darkish green. As another reviewer commented, the comforter is a bit "slim", but that's what I wanted. Something light for the summer when the air is on and you just need a little bit of cover. My other comforters are heavy and bulky, so this is just right for this time of year.Mostly I am pleased with the price. At $39.99, I just couldn't pass it up. I will recommend this deal to my friends.$LABEL$1

Excellent. Very comprehensive and an ideal companion to your Russian studies. It appears to have all I need in terms of vocabulary at a beginners/intermediate level, although it could contain more contemporary slang (important I feel when learning a language you will be exposed to on a daily basis)It is though the heaviest book I carry around daily and sometimes I could wish for a lighter dictionary!$LABEL$1

Entrepreneur Of The Year Says, "This is a Must-Read!". Our company used to be great at developing plans - we had grand plans, plans we'd worked on for months, and plans for our plans. We were planning experts. But we couldn't implement. Our plans sat in fancy binders and we pulled them out to look at them periodically, felt better because we had them, and couldn't figure out why things weren't happening like we'd planned.Then we read Mastering the Rockefeller Habits. And we found we could actually implement the plans that we learned how to develop from the methods and techniques defined in the book. We now have plans that work. And our company has matured tremendously as an organization from following the book. I strongly recommend that any company, from young start-up to those more mature, read and implement the strategies in this book. It will change your world.$LABEL$1

Disappointing. I liked the E-myth Revisited. I think every business owner should read it. After you read it, don't assume that his other stuff is good, because it isn't. After reading this book, and skimming some of his other ones, I will never buy any of his other products, and certainly will not be travelling for one of his $5,000.00 seminars about daydreaming.$LABEL$0
This album clears up the past!. After just a few listenings of this CD, it becomes abundantly clear that Scott Stapp's contribution to Creed was much less than he would have had us believe. This album is shallow, OBVIOUS, and contrived. His "lyrics" are very simple and predictable, and the overall tone of the album is really a poorly executed clone of earlier Creed. What this album lacks is originality and imagination....well......that and a SONGWRITER.Oddly enough, I read an interview today with Scott Stapp saying that he WAS basically the whole Creed sound. I couldn't disagree more.......although the throaty voice that bores you to tears is here in this new effort, the songwiriting here is just very immature.. He said in the interview that similar to when Sting left the Police......HIS new sound would remain what Creed was.......Stapp should NEVER put himself in the same league with Sting......nor should he presume he has a clue as to how to write a hit song.$LABEL$0

An expensive mistake.... Great product, but tho I wear size 9 shoes, the large size was too large. (I suspect the 'small' size would be too small, though I haven't tried them.) I hoped they'd shrink when washed and dried, but no luck. At $6 / pair, these were an expensive mistake.$LABEL$0
Nothing Like the Earlier Lindsays. Having the earlier Lindsay Quartet set of the Late Quartets, I was curious about their new, more recent, digital cycle. Unfortunately, their interpretation of the opp. 130 and 133 has become much sharper and more agressive. All of the dynmaics seem exaggerated and the whole performance seems so mannered that the players call attention to themselves rather than to the music. For a digital recording, the Takacs Quartet is superb. For good analogue, the earlier Lindsays and the Talich too. If you don't mind mono, the Hollywood and Busch Quartets are still hard to beat.$LABEL$0
Nice quality item. Cute for winter.. My daughter has this cute doll and the coat set makes a nice addition to the play gear.$LABEL$1
One of the best books I have ever read. I loved it!. If you haven't read this book yet, by all means, buy it! I could'nt put it down and didn't want it to end.$LABEL$1
I found the book to be a dissappointment.. It is quite clear that the author knows what she is talking about, but trying to use the book is another matter. The examples are all without context. The CD rom is a joke; what I need is a working database with all the bells and whistles and a book that explains how it works and how to convert the facets of the database to my particular situation. Prauge & Irwin's Access for Windows 95 Bible does this. I have not read the 97 version.$LABEL$0
Read it first in German. Am buying it in English for the sake of my almost 4 year old grandchildren. It is a wonderful "Why" book and a better "Why Not?" book equipped with the most restrictive of adult perspectives. The Stone Age tale is interspersed with modern references which are numbered. At the bottom of the page the references are identified as "anachronisms". I am hoping they use the same word in the English original. I find myself wishing that the same device was used with movies like Lion King. Our little boy twin is very interested in death. It would be helpful for him to know that having the father lion speak after death to his son was artistic license and does not really occur - at least not exactly like that. The book is droll. Sleeping under a stone blanket may deserve the warning: "This is pretend, don't let a heavy slab of rock fall on you just because you're tired!"$LABEL$1
received broken. We received this with a broken blue handle and wheel. Our grandson was visiting from Chicago and when he opened it the wooden wheel fell off the blue handle. Since he was anxious to play with the playdoh etc. we just ignored the broken part. Since you ask now it reminded me. So I wouldn't rate it good because of the flimsy design on the wheel and holder.$LABEL$0
what a disappointment. Rented this b/c of all the hype. What a disappointment. I was almost uncomfortable watching it all. It seems like the best filming was during the stripping/dancing, and then the rest was low budget, fairly poor acting. I like C.T., I think he has skill...in this movie, he is just the meat. Matthew McCaughnehey was over-acting the entire film. Storyline was extremely predictable, and the ending was...well, what ending really? It's almost as if the writers just threw in a "love story" plot without taking the time to develop it, then the end comes and all of a sudden two people end up together? I could've skipped the flick. I've never reviewed a movie until now...just wanted to forewarn people. Wait till it's free for Prime Members!$LABEL$0

Rambling in style the content does not deliver on what is a subject of great interest. This book is not going to be a landmark contribution to effective organisation design.

While consuming "aggressors" ' deeds.... Really nice doco required a personal bravery and some financial gambling to produce while an artist traveled terrorist-infested zones of Iraq, the Palestinian Authority and frontier Israel.What I like in this movie personally is depicting the surrounding as visualized and seen by a stranger to localities. What does not grasp my appreciation much is openly aired producer's own interpretation of historical facts, which prepared a viewer to particular conclusions in advance explicitly.Nice music undisputedly as a nice idea of keeping peace worldwide was, to a reviewer's feeling, much spoiled with dilettante simplicity of complex affairs by a critic himself consuming the "aggressors" ` deeds either directly or indirectly.$LABEL$1
Excellent. This was an excellent book. For beginners and experienced teddy bear makers. There are many helpful tips and tricks. Lots of great suggestions for locating supplies. It is an imagination jump-starter. A great reference tool, and a must have. I highly recommend this book.$LABEL$1
Well worth the read!!. A compelling storyline..Addictive at times to the point of not being able to put the book down because you'll want to continue to read further to see what happens next. Well developed characters. Wish Zedd had more play in the book. Goodkind spent to much time on the Denna(Mord-Sith) and Richard's inter-action. Michael's role should have been a bit more developed. Other than those few minute setbacks, this book was fantastic and very entertaining. I highly reccommend fantasy readers indulge in this book. You definitely wont be disappointed. I give it two thumbs up!!$LABEL$1
Not a very good phone. I bought this phone with high hopes, but after a couple weeks it really has proven to be a disappointment.First off, there is an echo that comes and goes. It doesn't sound so bad on my end, but I keep having other people (including clients) complain about it. So that right there is a deal breaker.Second, the battery life is dismal on this thing. My last cordless would go through the day fine, even make it through an hour or so the next day if I forgot to charge it. This thing goes out after about 3 hours of talk time. I'm on the phone a lot, so I need something that lasts a little longer.Third, after just a couple weeks, I can already feel the flimsy nature of the phone. It's become clear that this will not go six months without breaking.Overall this is a very disappointing product from RCA. The concept of this phone is great, it's just clear that not a lot of concern was put into putting out a quality product.$LABEL$0
Better than the first. I loved Soceress, it read so quick and easy. In Witch Child i found myself getting bored and waiting for something exciting to happen. In sorceress I was never bored and I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. This sequel is a great way to finish Mary's story.$LABEL$1

"You can leave right now if you're feeling doubt...". The best of Berlin 1979-1988 is such a perfect and rockin' album. I bought it for Christmas last year and I love it to pieces. Every song is amazing especially The Metro, Sex, No More Words, Blowin' Sky High, Masquerade, and Matter of Time. Frontwoman Terri Nunn has a beautiful and powerful voice, she's got some pipes!The song, Take my Breath Away ultimately caused a riff between the band and their creative process became threatened due to the popularity of that song. Even so this short-lived band made some incredible, heartfelt, weighty songs and all that matters. Berlin was a gift from God, great band, coy songs, and awesome frontwoman, eat your heart out Gwen Stefani, Terri was the real deal!$LABEL$1

Burns bright, burns easily, burns your hand. I've been using this bulb as an exact replacement for my desk lamp for years. It shines bright and has that traditional incandescent/tungsten color. But this bulb will also triple burn you. First, it gets super hot. I can't even touch the lamp if its been on for awhile without scolding my hand, let alone the bulb itself. Second, it burns easily. The filament is ultra hot/bright and doesn't seem to be the more durable 130volt version. As a result, any spikes in your power grid will burn out the filament. Third, the price is cheaper in places like Walmart. Way cheaper. Ouch.$LABEL$0

Magnificent!. The "Pied Piper Fantasy" is one of the finest works of modern American art music.

Works great. I really like this product. It is a little short for the portable crib, but it doesn't cause a problem.

Fond portrait.... Though this reads at times like a college textbook, it is thorough and intelligent, brings light to personality and the choices made throughout her reign. Not only does Weir introduce the internal workings of the throne, but also the society without, its culture and changes. When you are done reading this, not only will you know everything about the Golden Age of England and its Queen, but you will love them both.$LABEL$1
Card game genre hit the gamecube. This is the best game that no one knows about. It is a card game based (like Magic: The Gathering) RPG. This makes the game very interesting and fun. The graphics are superb (considering 2001 release), sound is okay, and the controls are very intuitive. The game is relatively easy for an RPG, with occasional places of difficulty. The gameplay downside is that levels beaten can not be reentered until after beating the game. This is a great game for both card game and RPG fans and I look foward to Lost Kingdoms II.$LABEL$1
Jack Flynn wins again...and it's even more fun.... McGrory continues the winning saga of Jack Flynn. The book is longer than the first in the series and perhaps a bit better. The plot avoids some of the aburdist elements of the first. The book is paced well and Flynn remains a charmer. It was nice to see how he has grown in life. I was surprised to see that the FBI love interest from the first book was not even mentioned here. What happened to her? Elizabeth Riggs is far better character, but still...I was glad my favorite fictional golden retriever Baker was back. It was great to meet Hank Sweeney too. McGrory's work is at times light and funny--Flynn is a great alter ego. The bigger mystery is still a bit nutty and unrealistic, but fascinating all the rest. I'll be back for my third Flynn book soon.$LABEL$1
Kindle Edition is worthless. I have read this book many a times. Even if you doubt the facts and conversations citied, it is written exquisitely.HOWEVER, IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT AMAZON IS CHARGING ANY KIND OF MONEY FOR THE KINDLE VERSION! Not only that, THE KINDLE VERSION PRESENTLY AVAILABLE SHOULD NOT EVEN BE OFFERED FOR FREE!Had I know that it will completely ruin the reading experience, I would have never bought the Kindle version, especially since I already have the hard copy.Shameful and disappointing on the part of Amazon.$LABEL$0

Good but... I had this thing for a month or two and playing it with my siblings was a blast. It is made pretty cheap though, but plays the games just right. My nephew accidentally tripped over it and it did break the cables in it, so I just bought a new one. So just be careful not to trip over it or have little kids fall on it, but for $20 I really couldn't be happier with this product.$LABEL$1
Ho. HUM.. I HAVE all of these!! Why the heck do they keep making these "Collectors Editions" with the same darn episodes!! I want to see season 4 and UP episodes. I agree with other comments about that. WHY NOT MAKE SEASONS!! Other shows are done that way. STUPID shows have seasons, why can't an entertaining Icon like THIS one have seasons?!!!!$LABEL$0
Wonderful CD!. When everybody thought that neo-soul was dead, Angie Stone comes along with "Mahogany Soul" and proves the world wrong! She shines especially on the track "Brotha". I haven't heard her much on the radio, but she more than deserves that recognition because of her talent. This album proves that she will be around for a long time to come!This album will make you wish this was the year 1973.$LABEL$1

Only the last 5% of this book worth reading. I am quite accustomed to reading "the classics"...Tolstoy, Dumas, Rinehart etc but this book bored me to tears...about the only time I found myself interested in it was near the very end, when it all comes together, and talks about the main characters philosphies...it was agony reading it through to the very end, but I forced myself thinking all along, surely this drivel has got to change at some time...and in the last 5% of it it did...I would not recommend this book to anyone.$LABEL$0
Unfortunately there is not a zero rating. This is the biggest piece of junk I have bought in many years. This is basically a prehistoric waterbed for dogs. It is merely a cheap plastic envelope thatis supposed to have a mystery gel inside to keep the bed cool. It takes forever to fill and then try to get the air bubbles out. The end result the bed is no cooler than the room you put it in. Sure it is cooler than the average dog temeprature of 102 degreees but so is my carpet.DO NOT BUY - a total waste of money and time!$LABEL$0
Can't believe how bad this game is. Weak sauce in a can.. What's wrong with Spore? Terrible game for many reasons mentioned below.1) evolution is pretty much pointless, like comments from other user. It doesn't matter what path you take - its just cutesy graphics. This game is Pokemon with less strategy.2) Blown release. This was due to ship... years ago. When there are "production delays" like this, run away with your money intact. You work too hard for it, don't you?3) EA = absolutely terrible company - fires its employees on games not destined to sell anyway (its not the QA's fault they put him on Lee Carvalho's Golf Challenge), its employees had to sue EA because it was such a sweatshop... YES, 80+ hour workweeks endlessly is sweatshop when you're on a finite salary....now this. Wasn't the EA/MAXIS SPORE team calling the Nintendo Wii junk that wouldn't sell a couple years ago?My Nintendo stock gave EA the critical beatdown.EA is a really bad company. Oh, and Spore comes with DRM.BOYCOTT EA$LABEL$0
Miniature Phones. The phones are really small, almost cell phone sized. This makes a conversation of any length impossible.Everytime we have a power outage, the remote phones have to be re-linked to the base unit. This is really bad if the power went out while you were away and now you are trying to answer a phone that doesn't work.I shelved these, and bought something better.$LABEL$0
Novel about Pro-lifers that cross the line misses the mark. This novel is about a group of pro-Life advocates that decide that non-violent means of protest that they have used in the past are ineffective. But after bombing a new facility for harvesting aborted babies, they learn that violence is not the answer either.This somewhat depressing novel didn't hold my interest and the plot doesn't seem to hold together. The audio quality was poor which made the listening even harder. I can't recommend it$LABEL$0
Good Product, Easy to Use and You Can See the Results. For an at home kit, this one is pretty good. Easy to use with simple to follow instructions and you really can see the results. I've used this product twice and each time it has worked wonderfully-I wait for it to come on as a lightning deal so I get a great price too. Just a fast way to get a noticeably whiter smile.$LABEL$1
I have altered the films, pray I don't alter them anymore.. I was just about able to deal with the previous special editions. I got used to those changes and thought that's what we were getting on these discs.

Original beauty lost in this adaption.. Bunyan's masterpiece is perfect as-is. Why someone would destroy a beautiful piece of literature is beyond me.

I advise reading the true work of John Bunyan and avoiding the fake recreations like this one. JFM.$LABEL$0
One of the best films ever!. This is by far one of the best films I've ever seen, let alone foreign film. The acting is exceptional and the chemistry between Isabelle Andjani and Vincent Perez is very believeable. If you love historical pieces and are not turned off by reading subtitles, this film is a must-see. It is spectacular. Sadly I was not able to buy it from Amazon but found it in London (that's the beauty of having a multi-system VCR!) and immediately purchased it! Any time I've lent out my copy for friends to watch, they have all inevitably purchased it. It is that good of a movie. Honestly speaking, I enjoy all kinds of movies but this movie especially is so worth seeing.$LABEL$1

Don Abusivo - Abusin the competition. This is a complete album from begining to end. My friends sister was bumping it in her ride and I tripped out when I heard it. It is totally diffeent from all this rap/banda stuff that is coming out. It is original in every way. Abusivo has a way of attacking his words that makes you feel what he is saying and lyrically he is killing the competition. I like alot Akwid but this guy is on another level (i have to admit). It is now my favorite cd to bump in my ride.....Check it out gente.$LABEL$1
Actually Criticizes Plato. To my surprise, the author expresses strongly negative opinions towards some of Plato's conclusions, while maintaining that Plato "asked the right questions."The author presents Plato as a proto-fascist. Plato's theories of the forms are muddled, and Aristotle was wise to clarify or dispense with them. Laws was a horrid work which formed an unfortunate ending to Plato's writings.I find the author's opinions to be eminently reasonable. His views represent a common-sense approach to Plato. The author, too, asks the right questions.$LABEL$1
Good thin mat. This mat is pretty thin, almost too much so to use alone but it is soft and good quality for what it is.It acts as a great base in the small carrier in the car and then we put another towel or something to cushion it a bit more so our chihuahua/toy poodle will like to lay down.This 18-by-13-inch size covers the whole carrier floor which is good; we had problems with mis-sized mats in the past. You can't beat the price from amazon, $5.95 w/ free shipping, which was about half what local and mart pet stores I researched were charging for this size and quality.$LABEL$1
Great for Small Dogs. These steps are perfect for anyone that has small dogs. My dogs are now able to get up on our tall furniture without hurting themselves.

Not Satisified. I have been sleeping with this foam memory pad but it does not go back to original shape. There is an indentation where I sleep on it which does not come back to shape.

It just keeps getting worse. I picked up this book as a nice distraction from holiday mahem at my house. Plus, it's been a while since I read a mindless romance novel. The first story provided MILD entertainment value, but I have to say that the second and third story get so bad I actually felt sorry for the authors. The story lines are weak and in some areas almost non-existent. The plots are predictable, and too much like other recent books I've read (the third story is just like Bridget Jones' Diary). It was so bad, I didn't even finish it and it's been YEARS since I didn't finish a book. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one...$LABEL$0

An awful shame. This movie is (usually) a great way to spend a lighthearted evening. However, the production quality of this disc is so abysmally bad that it is difficult to enjoy the movie.

Good gameplay, terrible story. The graphics were great. The battle system was different than most RPGs, but it was ok. The gameplay was pretty good (like camera angles, manuverability, ect.) But there were a lot of things I didn't like. The story line started out ok but got really boring and was kinda stupid as it progressed. And the end was terrible. The 30 mins or so it took to watch it could have been much better spent doing ANYTHING else. I also didn't like the method for upgrading weapons. You had to recruit people to make stuff, make certain items and then add it your weapon. But they never made anything all that great for me (and I spent many hours trying). I think this game was a flop.$LABEL$0

the journey and not the destination. I found this book to be wholly and completely engaging. While it's true that Murakami does leave many, in fact, dozens of questions unanswered, I believe the beauty of his book is in the journey and not the destination of the story. Toru is clearly overwhelmed by the ambiguity of both his situation and the people he meets. He searches for something "concrete" that he can wrap his head around. But he learns, as do we, that one can't always understand what's happening, or why it is. Sometimes you just have to go along, and hope for the best. It becomes a matter of faith.$LABEL$1
poor craftmanship. I loved this vacuum until it started to fall apart. It began with the very short cord getting stuck and then frayed. That was wrapped with electrical tape. Then the hose tore at the point of entry to the canister. Again we used electrical tape to hold it together. Finally, the hose tore at the other end and out comes the electrical tape again. Instead of a 2 year vacuum, it looks like a 10 year vacuum. It also flips over easily and the attachments fall out and we lost one. Soo, I guess the moral of the story is don't get a Bosch vacuum!! Also, it was overpriced for the quality and forget about the service!$LABEL$0
Heart felt. I read these books. I have loaned these books. I have bought and given these books to others. What more could I say. I have read book 1, 2, 3 and "What God Wants". Book 1 was my favorite. They are all Great. Enjoy the message.$LABEL$1
Good at first.... I have has this TV for approximately 5 years. I really liked it when I first for it other than it is kind of loud, hard to get use to at first.After just a year I had to replace the lamp which is between 100-200 dollars, not in when it just goes out and you have to scramble around to find it and have to order online, when you only have 1 TV it's a bummer.Now for the worse part... A few months ago I noticed a little white dot on the screen for someone with a little case of OCD it drives you nuts, BUT... Now a couple months later there is 23 white dots and about 30 black dots so it can bug me whether I am watching a light screens or a dark one! Yippee! Needless to say I HATE this TV I think it's garbage and wouldn't recommend it to anyone!$LABEL$0
Don't Buy it. I bought Ghost after my disk drive in my Dell computer began to fail. I followed Symantec's instructions 3 times to image a bootable new drive with no avail. Files were copied, but the drive would not boot. Finally, I got a free software download from the manufacturer of the new drive (Western Digital)and it worked fine. After booting up with the new drive, all programs worked except, you guessed it, all of Norton's stuff, the antivirus, internet security, etc... The kicker is that their suggestion was now to uninstall their software and re-install it again. But the software would not uninstall (including Ghost). The funny part is that their site recommends uninstalling all their software before doing a migration, including Gohst! In other words, you are supposed to uninstall Ghost before you use it to create the new disk. Duh...$LABEL$0
Good Basic Book for Homeschoolers. Montessori at Home is a good book for the home schooler who wants to set up a Montessori atmosphere at home.

If it weren't for the great reviews of Desperation I would have got something else - but I thought the story was reasonable, just badly constructed.The idea that the whole thing (430 pages) takes place in a few houses in the one street in one afternoon/night reminds me of Geralds Game, and that was fairly poor also.The main story (people hiding from maniacs in vans) is very boring. However it is the 'underlying' story of a force that has become part of and taken over a young autistic child that kept me going - even this was boring at times.If you want horror read Salems Lot or The Shining, if you want a brilliant story read It or The Stand or The Green Mile.I just hope Desperation is better.$LABEL$0
Not USB. I had searched for a cheap USB headset and this one showed up in the results. The product description does NOT include the connector type (should have been my first clue). I just got this yesterday and it is a standard 3.5 mm jack. I needed a USB.Quality wise it's OK for a cheap product but be aware that it is not USB in case that is what you are looking for.$LABEL$0
Excellent!!!. I enjoyed the funny antics, the mystery, the adventures,and the racing in the desert of Saudi Arabia. It made you feel like a noble nomad of the desert. The actors were awesome!! It was definitely worth having, especially for the 80's. Old and very interesting to watch over and over, again.$LABEL$1

Too many "selfs" to follow. This book started off making sense but then it kept talking about Self A and Self B.... It went around topics. It kind of made it hard to keep up with reading. It never really helped my game at all and so I looked for other books. There are other books out there that can help your mental tennis game.$LABEL$0
Gibberish..Nefarious...Irrational... The author and the reviewer Dr.Marshall successfuly joins the ranks of the German and British conspirators who concocted many theories and misinterpretations of the Vedic Religion.

Doesn't look like a "woman's" watch. I ordered this through the seller "Just Brands" on Amazon, and in person the watch is actually much more chunky and masculine than the picture. I attempted to return it and Just Brands was the worst company I've ever had to deal with. They were impossible to get a hold of in order to get an authorization number to return the watch. Then once I returned it they denied receiving it even though I had a delivery confirmation from the post office. Luckily Amazon refunded my money. I really liked the look of the watch on Amazon, but when I saw it in person, it was just too big.$LABEL$0
Great Movie--Disapponting DVD. This is perhaps one of the greatest music-themed movies ever made. You will find yourself spellbound at the talent and energy these first-time actors bring to this film. Lead singer Andrew Strong was only sixteen years old when this film was made, yet he has a voice which sounds like its seen a world of pain. Twentieth Century Fox has taken a diamond and smashed it to bits by not offering this DVD in a widescreen format (with DTS stereo). It could be a reference DVD if done properly. Maybe the Criterion folks will do it. Until then, don't bother with the full-screen version.$LABEL$0

A TRUE LOSS OF FAITH.. Faith Hathaway had just graduated High School and was one week away from going into the army. She was full of hope and life. Robert Willie( the man this movie was based on), along with his accomplice raped and murdered her. She was raped, stabbed 17 times, and raped after she died. The director of this movie denied requests made by Faith's mother, and gave all the attention to the only person who deserved to die. Where was the mercy for Faith? Where was the compassion for Faith? Where were the people protesting for Faith's life? Finally where was the story about the mercy which was denied to Faith? What about her suffering and that of her family? Barely a foot note in this movie. Ohh and Sister Prejean has been discovered to lie when it suits her case.$LABEL$0

well rounded reference...... As time is of the essence while travelling, I wanted to make the most of my time on the islands. This book allowed me to explore and choose a hike that was perfect for the length of my stay. I felt comfortable with the route laid out on paper. I was dissatisfied with THE BUS route and scheduling on Oahu as compared to the simple statement under how to get there. I had to explore a different route and connection but felt that THE BUS system was to blame. Otherwise, I felt that the book did sufficiently lead to the perfect hike for me at the time. The trail was beautiful and I look forward to using the book again down the road.$LABEL$1
Great sandal!. This is my third pair! I recommend buying a size larger though to have a little space behind the heel. Otherwise, the back of the sandal lines up right to the heel. I wear them daily in the summer, walking around the city all day long, and they last a half-year. Very comfortable, although I wish it had more arch support. Amazon shipped it to my door in less than 24 hrs!$LABEL$1

I'm a Marine in the United states. (This show is awesome). Not many shows (let alone cartoons) have the quality that avatar has brought. I'm never let down when a new episode. Some are not as epic as others but altogether it is a show that never disappoints. Values are instilled, humor is involved, and an adventure is brought that would give any child a more active imagination. I leave the show each episode somehow more relaxed and at peace. This show is a DEFINATE. Just give it a shot first through the first 4 episodes (the time for one movie) and just see if you aren't curious to see "just one more episode".Lcpl Koda, Gary V.$LABEL$1
Disappointed. I bought this book partially based on all the positive reviews. However, I was extremely disappointed. The author never mentions that poor grades could be due to a learning disability or adhd. I understand this book is not about learning disabilities or adhd, but it should be mentioned as a possibility for those parent's who have not considered it as a possibility. I suppose the book would be helpful for some parents, but my copy is sitting around gathering dust.$LABEL$0
KitchenAid 560 blender. I don't work for Amazon nor KitchenAid. I have no conflicts of interest.I researched this blender extensively in YouTube, Consumer Reports, etc, prior to buying. My purpose is exclusively to make vegetable smoothies of Kale, Spinach, Carrots, Pumpkin, Wild Blueberries and Wakame with mushrooms for my health. I eat a plant-based diet only. I bought it 'Refurbished' at $65 including S&H.; It came like new packed beautifully with its handbook. I use it every other day. It grinds everything I need perfectly. It has no leaks and has worked flawlessly. I would heartily recommend it to everyone. At the price I bought it is a huge bargain.$LABEL$1
My #1 cookbook. This is my fav cookbook. Actually this is the second one I've had.

Jan Karon hits the mark.. All of Ms. Karon's books are inspirational, but this one is especially so.

Adjustment Not So Bad. Although the previous review is correct in that there is a 'gap' between the last bead and the handle, I would not have noticed it without having it pointed out to me.On the other hand the rope is quite easy to adjust because of that 'feature'. In reading reviews of other jump ropes on Amazon it seems to me that this one is probably better than most when it comes to adjustment.As far as functionality it works fine, I wish I could jump rope better, but that's my problem (!)If color is important I will note that I thought it would be yellow and black as the illustration on the website, but it turned out to be gray and black. A pretty dull color combo.Looks like you can get a choice of color if you pick the ones that come direct from the mfgr but then you have to pay shipping, mine came thru Amazon Prime.Who would have thought there would be so much to say about a jump rope?P.S. It's nice to buy something that doesn't come with a 'power brick', SD card or USB cable...$LABEL$1
One mistake in the book cause me to doubt the entire book.. Horror! Page 8 has a mistake so bad it makes me doubt the entire book, "The first semi-conductor...was discovered ...in 1965... It took seven more years before the first commercial application appeared..." I beg to differ. I was working in Fairchild Semiconductor, Inc. in Mountain View, California designing integrated circuits in 1964. I must be dreaming then or the the author in talking about some other technology. It makes me wonder about the rest of the book.$LABEL$0

Still Wondering. I found Hornest's Nest hard to get into. The story and plot slow and I was always wondering when Dr. Scarpetta was going to get involved. Then I couldn't put it down. I thought it was great that West and Brazil got together could be interesting for a future series? I thought the ending was very disappointing and I felt like the book wrapped up too fast and as a reader you were left hanging. Would be interested to see if Ms. Cornwell will continue with these characters.$LABEL$0
It's pretty awful.. Stephen Baldwin is a horror writer who discovers he has an identical, murderous clone. This silly Dean Koontz adaptation is based off of his equally silly novel, so it's no surprise the script has all the typical Koontz plot elements: Government conspiracy, heroes going on the run, and a final fight in the middle of nowhere. The only difference is that the mystery is revealed at the beginning! Overlong miniseries (Which actually features nudity in the video version)features countless leapholes in logic, unconvincing special effects, and a hilariously wooden Stephen Baldwin as the writer and killer. You can count the number of good Koontz novels and movies on one hand (Phantoms, anyone?), and this sure as hell isn't one of them.$LABEL$0

Possibly Shallower than its Subject.. This is a very poor book. It has almost nothing to do with Las Vegas at all. It centers on porn stars and the porn industry, and the people profiled are most vapid and boring along with being incapable of reflection. The narrator's inability to make note of their deficient qualities and provide any sort of insight is its real flaw; however, as Sheehan appears incapable of judging anything or anybody which is indicative of many an academic nowadays. These types concentrate on being "tolerant" and "non-judgmental" which results in their having nothing to say. Porn is a means to an end for most guys. It isn't intriguing or meaningful. It's something in lieu of something else. If you enjoy reading about Las Vegas, I'd advise you to look at other titles.$LABEL$0
remixes came too late to save the song. First of all, like my title says, these remixes came to late for the club crowd. But, if you like Willa you'll be intrested anyway:1. Mike Rizzo Club Mix (6.39): Love this mix it speeds up the chorus vocals but keeps the verse vocals at almost regular speed. Really cool beat. Best mix in my opinion.2. Sal Parm {of Plasmic Honey}Club Mix (9.14): Sal doesn't do a very good job. The track is cool but the vocals are way too slow for the bpm (beats per minute). Same goes for his radio edit.3. Mike Rizzo Hyper Vocal Mix (6.09): Hyper vocal indeed. If I didn't know the words to this song by memory I wouldn't be able to understand the verses in this mix. They just go by too fast.4. Sal Parm Dub (7.14): Very, very disappointing. Usually, even when the mix is bad, remix artists have a chance to redeem themselves on their dub but not Sal Parm. I really expected better mixes form him.5. Sal Parm Radio Edit (3.59): See Track 2I'd give 3 stars but the mixes were too late.$LABEL$0

Great book. I'm obsessed with Shaker furnitue and architecture. I'll get around to reviewing all of my books in time. I think I have every Shaker book printed!This one isn't "Complete" but there's an aweful lot in here. I look at "complete" more or less as meaning "most" variety of furniture. I didn't take it literally.This is one book that gives a lot of weight to Shaker built-ins as well. Of which I'm trying to re-create so I've been referencing this book a lot lately.I do have other books, some of which focus more on details and drawings with potential variety in drawer configurations for example, others more on color and simple photos etc.So far it 's been one of my favorites in terms of the wide variety of material it contains. An overall wonderful photo and text reference to existing furniture.$LABEL$1
I Agree - This one is JUNK. This is the third Norelco shaver I have owned and the second rechargeable. My first rechargeable was wonderful. This one is junk. It barely turns fast enough to use when plugged in or immediately after a recharge.

"White Ladder" Nothing Remarkable. Wow. It's rare to see an album rated a clean 5 stars across the board, and for that reason alone I was willing to give this record a listen. Add to that the facts that I love the song "Babylon" and that Dave Matthews, whom I respect, claims to have listened to this record almost exclusivly for months. Armed with that information, I was prepared for a record that would sit at the top of my collection for a good, long time.Ho-hum. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. Perhaps it's just the hyperbolic whiplash inherent in overexpectation. Perhaps it's that David Gray writes lyrically mediocre songs then records them with undistinguished musical backing. Perhaps it's his grating voice, which works well on a single song, but annoys on an entire CD.I won't dispute the hundreds of other reviewers here and elsewhere who loved this album unquestionably. I'll just assume that I'm missing something and move on.$LABEL$0

FINALLY! SLEEP!. This book is a lifesaver! The ideal of Parent Directed Feedings reads like common sense. I don't know why there is so much controversy over this issue.

Not sure about this one.... I am new to java but not to programming, so maybe this wasn't the book for me. While the style is new and innovative, I eventually got worn down by the constant humor, margin notes, and bizarre analogies. I also found that trying to use this book as a reference was nearly impossible. When the book did have a clear answer to what I was looking for, it was buried in the same quagmire I mentioned above.I suppose that if you are completely new to writing any form of code, this may be the right book for you. I would tend to think, however, that you will quickly grow out of it, and then its use as a reference later will hardly justify the space on your shelf. As an alternative, I would suggest "Learning Java" 2nd Edition (also published by O'Reilly).$LABEL$0
Gets worse with each passing minute.. Charlize Theron is a concerned wife who believes her astronaut husband (Johnny Depp) isn't quite himself after a mysterious accident in outer space. Paranoid, Roman Polanski-style thriller moves at an incredibly slow pace, rambles on predictably, and concludes with an obvious, Outer Limits-type ending. This is most notable for featuring Clea Duvall, which makes it three films the actress has been in where people are possessed by extraterrestrials (the other two being The Faculty and Ghosts of Mars).* 1/2 out of *****$LABEL$0

This wallet is rugged and classy!. I have been carrying eel skin wallets since the mid 1980's. I think those of us that carry eel skin wallets are loyal--once we carry them they are the only type that will ever do. I am always careful to buy Conger eel skin, which is what this wallet is. It is very rugged and takes a lot of abuse and always looks great. It also has a very classy look. Lots of room for credit cards. It takes a little time to break it in--as with any new wallet, but it is worth the effort. Eel skin wallets make great gifts!$LABEL$1

Very disappointed. I was very excited to purchase and read this book, however, once I did I was very disappointed. The book is very confusing constantly jumping from one character to another.

I do not think I would read another of this author's works.$LABEL$0
Saint Etienne - The Bad Photographer. Saint Etienne's remixers for THE BAD PHOTOGRAPHER don't touch the title track, but instead take on phantom tracks that don't appear elsewhere. Kid Loco takes "4:35 in the Morning" further into deliciously mellow downtempo territory, even as horns come in the background, while the Bronx Dogs go thick and dark on "Foto Stat." Add N to (X) remake the cheekily titled "Uri Geller Bent My Boyfriend" into an abstract digital wonderland, with a sudden crash of rhythm towards the middle.$LABEL$1

too Much NOISE? Not in the End.. What a funny, silly picture book! I've read this to K-2 classes and they get the point: We complain until we see life could be worse. And that is the lesson the "wise man" of the village teaches "old man" Peter. But HOW he "trickily" teaches this is the fun of the story.I am amazed at the cummulative memory the youngest have in accompanying me in the repetitious words and sounds. They have fun.

Gratuitous obcenity and (very) soft porn. A confusing silly mishmash of soft porn and filthy language topped off with a raving Dennis Hopper, who during a long period in his career appeared in a number of stinkers, apparently to pay the rent.There is nothing of any artistic merit in this travesty of moviemaking - the editing, direction, story, music, photography and acting are all ludicrous and repellent, without exception. Matthew Modine, in his excessive kissing scenes seems to be wanting to prove something...if you make it past the early scene, I suppose you can survive the rest of the movie.Well maybe there is one exception - Claudia Schiffer IS a sweetie and she deserved a better vehicle in her first major film role; she's tolerably competent and nice to look at. Unfortunately, her character is brutalized and abused for caring, and somehow she always comes back for more; maybe she's a masochist.$LABEL$0
Utterly boring. I really looked forward to what the great Herbie Hancock would do with such cream-of-the-crop vocalists and musicians.The answer - absolutely nothing. No doubt you'll find such a declaration hard to believe, but go ahead and waste your time listening to this total flop, right across the board. There's just nothing here, nothing new, nothing interesting.Take the Santana track for example. Sounds completely and uniquely Sanatana, just like you've heard a hundred times before.Sting warps his voice at the start of his song, then settles back into the usual Sting sound - but it's all been heard before, so why would anyone want this?I was most looking forward to what Christina would do with her song, and I found out - taking it in every direction except one that makes sense.This is a product put out by people who think the public is stupid, and will eat up anything.Better off getting the best albums by the individual artists (eg. John Mayers' "Any Given Thursday").$LABEL$0
I've been pondering, what's so great about Coldplay?. It may be nothing really, just a british band that ripped off Radiohead, yet Radiohead still has better talent, better songs and a better singer.

Just listen to Ok Computer and listen to this album and tell me which one is better.PS. The singer of Radiohead said that they are nothing more than pop and no skill.$LABEL$0

Elegant design and functional, when it worked.. I recently purchased this palm for my mother who was interested in getting a new PDA. While the device itself worked perfectly, there was one major problem we seemed to have with it. The device itself seemed to stop turning on after a while. We had purchased the store's extended warranty so we just took it back and they replaced it. Second one, the same thing happened again. So we tried fiddling around with the battery, apparently the battery easily loses it's connection so the unit itself will not power on unless you fiddle with the battery. Two PDA's in a row with the same exact problem, and another reviewer encountered something similar, I think it's fair to say the initial release batch of this PDA has definitely had some issues. We ended up exchanging it for a Palm TX.My mother said she loved it while it worked, and is very disappointed such a trivial problem can cause so much annoyance.$LABEL$0

Mad Dog and Glory. If this movie did not have Robert DeNiro and Bill Murray in it, you probably wouldn't finish watching it. It's hard to understand how someone would have read the script or seen the rough cut and said "people are going to come see this." The plot is standard-issue "man falls in love with hooker with heart of gold and has to save her from the mafia" stuff. DeNiro's character is not really likeable and Murray's is overplayed a little, though still fun to watch. If you don't love either of these two actors, skip it.$LABEL$0

New production kind of lacking. I know that this toy has been around for several generations and in theory is a great toy. However, when I got the one I just recently ordered, I was sad to discover that the product design has slightly changed and almost makes the toy unusable. There used to be a rubber ring that sat in the holes to keep the pegs firmly stable so you can "pound the pegs" but they new design has a very loose ring and the pegs barely stay in the main wood frame. They fall out so easily, there's really no pounding of the pegs that gets to be done as the pegs basically just fall through the holes.$LABEL$0
Awesome Digital Camera Bag. I like this product because it's not much bigger than the camera. It has both velcro and clasp closings to ensure the camera stays in the bag. It also carries my extra SD card and battery pack.$LABEL$1
A Scam. It should be rated "zero stars." Like the rest of the people here who hate this product, my son's LeapPad worked just long enough for the warranty to expire and for me to stock up on books. My son was very careful with the toy. Even a new "pen" could not save it. Customer "service" (HA!) was rude, and implied that my son broke it. The people at Leap Frog products ought to be ashamed of themselves!There is only one guarantee with a Leap Pad -9 out of 10 people who wrote its positive reviews will change their minds in a year or two, when their Leap Pad dies and Leap Frog blames them.$LABEL$0

For those who love Heroes III. Actually 3.5 *. Armageddons Blade doesn't include that much new things, but the Elemental town is funny, though it is shame that the concept of all 7th level creatures growing at 1 per week (basic) i abandoned - phoenix grows at 2 per week (4 with castle), which is too great an advantage, even though it is somewhat weaker than the other 7th level creatures. The new neutral dragons are terribly (too?) expensive, even though they are awfully strong. I wonder, if they ever will be of that much use. Anyway, if you liked Heroes III, this is an excellent way of trying new scenarios and campaigns. I miss some new spells, artifacts (there are two new relic artifacts, though) and some modified secondary skills (too many of them stinks!), though.$LABEL$1

I think this could have been a great collection if made longer, or possibly even a two CD set, although maybe they figured nobody would spring for that......too bad, it remains a "couldve been great"......$LABEL$0
So strange, so good. What I enjoyed most about his book was how the story flowed, and how the author turned a true story into a very enjoyable novel.What's truly remarkable about this book, aside from the strange and chilling story, is the characters, and how the author manages to weave them in and out of the narrative. It works to perfection, leaving the reader with strong emotions towards the major figures in this case. The authors ability to get behind the scenes, including his use of the actual police files from 1982, gives us delicious new details about Durst and the case, and leads us up to the murders of Susan Berman in 2000 and Morris Black in 2001. Add in the political machinations, particulary the questionable-at-best actions of the Westchester, NY district attorney, and you have one heck of a story. The Durst trial for the Black murder is next spring, and anyone even remotely interested in this case must read this thoroughly engrossing book.$LABEL$1
Forgettable.... Not the best revival, and certainly not the best overall. I don't remember much except that Tyne Daly, despite clear devotion to the role, has a voice that, to my ears, sounds weak, forced and occasionally off-key. Supporting cast members are so-so. This must be a very difficult role to sing, as even Roberta Peters falls flat (despite some exceptionally interesting interpretation). In my opinion, Patty Lupone's rendition is the best of the recent revivals, but Ethel Merman is still "The Mama" (after all these years)...$LABEL$0
OH It's Spy Kids 3 and it's 3D!. Isn't it sad that the Spy Kids is still on? Robert Rodriguez, the creator, has no imagination. All this is is the same thing as Spy Kids 1 & 2, with a bad attempt at making it 3D. And now they'll make Shark Boy and Lava Girl!LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY$LABEL$0
Overrated. There are several issues I have with this book:--This book should come with a large, bold, underlined disclaimer that it is not for victims of abuse. Only too late in the book does the author make this point. Being abused is not your fault; you are not "asking" for it.--This book did not encourage me to improve myself. Instead, I felt like it was almost hopeless to try to improve, because it was so complicated!--Also, this book claims to not fall in the trap of all the "self-..." books, however, it is obsessed with "self-deception". If it truly was not a "self-..." book it would have placed a larger emphasis on losing yourself in service for others, instead of being consumed with reflections on your faults.If you wish to improve yourself without the complication, Gordon B. Hinckley's "Standing for Something" actually encourages realistic improvements and makes you feel that you have potential to be a great person.$LABEL$0
Terrible attempt of a story. This is a terrible book that my English teacher forced the class to read. While reading it, it almost seemed as though someone told Joyce McDonald to write a sad depressing story about how evil guns are!!! It is a terrible book, the writing is decent, but the story is horrid. Don't read it!!!!! Save yourself from a bore!$LABEL$0
BAD BAD BAD. see above. Seriously...I have had a run of bad luck. I am a huge reader who averages between 4-10 books a week. I am constantly keeping my eye out for good books. This was a HUGE dissapointment. I picked it up because it was highly recommended and won some misleading award. I did not relate to the main characters and found the relationships to be far too weird to be interesting. Just a bad book all around.$LABEL$0

Christmas gone Crazy. I must admit, although this book is very desturbing and some of the characters rather creepy, I liked the plot. On a "ick" factor, I'd give it an 8 out of 10. But Hey, for a novel, that's a good thing in my book. At least the characters are believable, if not Icky.

Royce Da 5'9 - M.I.C. This is the second album that I picked up from Royce. This isn't really a solo album by him, his M.I.C group is also on a lot of the songs. Don't let that keep you from getting this though.Lyrically, Royce and the M.I.C is real on this album. Its the same old Royce you know from any other songs/albums hes been on.Production wise, this album is very good, some of the beats were decent/medicore, but most were bangers. The songs I listed in my top 5 have very dope beats.If you like Royce, then this album is for you plain and simple. Nothing weak abou it!Peace.My Top 5 Songs1.On The Road2.Dope3.Gone In 30 Seconds4.Basic5.No Talent Rappers$LABEL$1
Monster Bass Lines by Shandrleria Praematurus. Squire wrote a fist of progressive songs of the highest level, at the finest moment of the progressive-atlantic-LP era: the early seventies. The five tracks are just genius. "Silently Falling" and "Lucky Seven" show the best moment of Bill Brufford at the drums. If this would be a Yes Album, it would be between the classics, like "Relayer" and "Close To The Edge"; but Chris wanted it to be done alone, with a little help from Mel, Patrick, Bill and Andrew. Five Stars, no more.$LABEL$1
Very confusing. Some might say that movies with little dialogue are interesting and artistic but I disagree. I was confused almost right from the get-go. I had no idea what was going on and I couldn't even figure out who the main characters were. The movie is kind of slow moving and a lot goes on but very little is explained. I wouldn't really suggest this movie unless you are one of those people who have laser-focused attention. I do not, especially when I'm at home. I do have to give props though, as the story is a very good idea.$LABEL$0
wow. there is nothing good about this movie. we have heard the plot before. the acting is some of the worst i have ever seen. the outfits are wrong and it is filmed so badly that i do not care what happens to the rest of the human race. i think a lot of my problems with the movie was casting. theron was a horrible pick for the role. very dissapointed.$LABEL$0
Where did all the money go?. Where to begin? How about...not fun. Bad graphics+bad gameplay+bad sound+no replay value=bad game.

Outstanding!. Ms. Bagely is truly a gifted poet. One of her mesmerizing poems, The House That was Alive, was written for and is featured in my novel, "Even Angels Fall".

Mouse & Twink - 'Out Of The Pink Into The Blues' (HTD Records). More or less, a cheesy compilation that my guess is that this CD was NOT released with Twink's approval. Too many lame-sounding covers. Jimi Hendrix's "Red House", J.J.Cale's "Youngblood", Santana's "Oye Come Va", Big Joe Turner's "Kansas City", the Stone's "Midnight Rambler" among others. Really nice cover, though.

not universal enough. Pros: sturdy, illuminated buttonsCons: those nice, sturdy, illuminated buttons don't do what I want. the pre-programmed codes were sufficient to get basic functions working on several devices (TV, VCR, receiver, DVD player), but when I tried to get this remote control to learn some other functions on my Denon AVR-3000 receiver and Sony XDR-F1HD tuner, it refused. I followed all of the tips in the owner's manual: I put new batteries in both remotes, I turned off the fluorescent lights, I moved the remotes closer and farther, I tapped the button instead of holding it, I stood on my head (just kidding). I tried dozens of times with no success. So I went to Radio Shack and bought the cheapest learning remote in the store (Radio Shack 7-in-1 Universal HD Remote Control); it learned those functions on the first try. I wish it had sturdy, illuminated buttons (it doesn't), but at least it works.$LABEL$0
The real problem is.... Firstly, this movie does some things well. The introductions of most of the cast were reasonably good and the general plot began to develop quickly. As for the comic relief parts, some of the one-liners in this movies are better than the one-liners I've heard in most movies.The main problem this movie has is, once the main premise, ants attacking humans in an office building, is underway... the threat level never increases. As you'd expect, the body count rises, but in this movie, that is usually the result of the victim's actions.I think the writers should have spent more time trying to decide what actually happens when ants start attacking people. Aside from that, the only problem is that a central character debuts far too close to the end of the movie.It does have its good points, but ultimately, the main elements of the plot could have been handled better.$LABEL$0
Too much. This was a compilation of all the plots experienced mystery writers have developed more fully in individualbooks.

A Key Part of Virginia History. The VA Teachers Association was the Black teachers' organization in Virginia in the first half of the 20th century. It was central to the civil rights struggle in Virginia. This is an official history, but a lively and exciting one. If you want to understand what Black communities faced in the Jim Crow years, and the ingenuity and dignity with which they struggled, this is an excellent book to read. This organization no longer exists, having been integrated into the VA Education Association, so this book tells its entire history, from the early stages, taken at great risk, through the process of integration.$LABEL$1
Motor burned out. From the day we got this, it was excessively loud, and occasionally had that "something is burning" smell... at first I attributed the odor to the break-in of a new heavy duty motor, but from time to time it would come back.Well, 14 months later the motor burned out making an ordinary batch of cookies, and customer service merely suggested I take it to a center for repair.I am very disappointed with this product, I think it was defective from the start.$LABEL$0
Listening to it on and on and on and on.... This album, as has already been pointed out, is excellent. It's the kind of music you listen too when you're depressed, and then you feel really good again. It's music you can easily absorb. It flows into your brain and makes everything seem better. It's the kind of music you simply have to hum whaen feeling good.

Very predictable movie. This movie was a real flop. It was predictable from the get go. No creativity or imagination can be found in this movie. It is not worth the 3 or 4 dollars it would cost to rent it. I very much enjoyed Legaly Blonde and was expecting a similar level of enjoyment. What a let down. Also it would seem that Ms. Witherspoon has shed enough pounds to lower herself from a very attractive woman to a gaunt stick...very sad.$LABEL$0

I think the seller posted to a wrong place, so I am disappointed and doesn't know what to do with this toy now.

Returned it after a month. For a 2.4 GHz phone, the range was horrible. I got much better reception with my old 900 MHz. Also, it would be nice if the channels automatically changed when needed, since the reception was so bad (you had to change often). The caller ID was also weird in that if you picked up the phone and missed the call, that number wouldn't be in the caller ID. Overall, we were surprisingly very unhappy with the phone, and just returned it.$LABEL$0

incredible well written book. i got this book and just zoomed through it because the time period of the 1700's and this book has a great story line and with a Caribbean story line and dealing with Race, Class and everything else in between. this Book goes into both main characters lives and brings them together as one.

simple yet enjoyable stories of revenge.... Cornell Woolrich is one of those 1940s writers who pumped out loads of pulp fiction that have by now largely gone out of print. He was a very good storyteller but only an average writer - that is, his prose and characterizations are not particularly good. 'The Bride Wore Black' fits this rule completely.In 'The Bride Wore Black' we have essentially five different murder stories with one seemingly common element: the same murderess. In the end we understand a bit more about her motive and why these victims were chosen. Woolrich also delivers a delicious surprise ending. Don't expect any subplots or side romances. This is pure, simple reading enjoyment that doesn't tax the brain but keeps your eyes glued to the pages.Bottom line: certainly among Woolrich's better books. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1
Making It Work for My Golf Cart. Got this at a great price from Amazon. Shipping fast. I bought 6 of them so that myself and my neighbors could secure our golf carts.

Terrible.. It amazes me that for all of his pomp and "patriotism," Mr. Hannity cannot see that by eliminating liberalism (which he classifies as part of the "evil" we must be delivered from) he is advocating a Republic form of government. Unlike Sean, I believe it's ok for people to have different opinions -- one of them crazy "liberal" ideas -- but for someone who claims his love for America with such fervency, it's ironic that he so clearly resents the most integral aspect of democracy: more than one voice. He equates 50% of the American population as on par with terrorists at worst, as opposition at best...I would argue that someone who loves and understands this country knows that the left and right are part of a system of checks and balances created in order to avoid one party having absolute power -- not enemies with clearly defined agendas of good and evil.$LABEL$0

Setup is a pain!. The instructions aren't quite clear in a few places--poor image views and very limited text that doesn't really tell you what or where. This lead me to install the front panel incorrectly, which is attached by VERY cheap plastic pins that cannot be removed without breaking them.Also, the ignition electrode has a wide flat connector which is supposed to attach to a round small wire connector. Guess what? flat pieces don't fit in round sockets! In trying to force the wire onto the connector, I broke the electrode. Cost to replace? US$12.94. The warranty does not cover parts damaged during setup.Keep in mind, I'm usually pretty good at these kind of projects. I've had no trouble building furniture, installing lights and ceiling fans, etc., so it's not like I'm incapable of following directions. Next time, I'll get a a different brand, if this is any indication of the "support" I can expect from do-it-yourself Char-Broil grills!$LABEL$0

This is not Helmet. I love Helmet but this is not Helmet. I was looking so foward to the day that Helmet would finally put another album out and this was such a huge disappointment. Page tries to sing, much like James Hetfield of the now much watered down Metallica, and fails miserably like Hetfield. Since the rest of the original members aren't back I am not even sure why Page is calling the band Helmet. The anger and aggression of their previous efforts are soarly missed like the rest of the band.$LABEL$0
High capacity, Looks Good, Kind of Pricey for a Black of Wood. I needed a larger wooden block for my Henckels collection since I expanded my knife set. It was amazing how expensive a large capacity slot knife block could get. I looked everywhere and saw that Amazon had the most reasonable price for $50 with free shipping and no tax. I'm happy since it compliments my knife set nicely. I'd recommend it to anyone interested who own a Henckels knife set; however, beware that your overpaying for something that probably costs $5 or less to make.$LABEL$1
It's cheap, and it breaks. In spite of the poor reviews, I went out and bought one of these. It worked WONDERFULLY for the first month. And then one day, it just died. Sure, I'm the idiot that threw out the box and the receipt. I may open it and try to fix it. But it broke with zero abuse.Worse, the degree of amplification seemed uncorrelated with antenna performance. As long as it was on, it was working well enough. Except for the times (before it broke) when the cable seemed "loose" and the signal was fuzzy.Don't buy it. Even at the low cost, it's not worth it. Other antennae work just as well (I'm using rabbit ears right now and I'm getting 95% of what I got with this) and don't break.$LABEL$0
Rabbit gets sticky after four years. The device works well mechanically. You should know that there is a coating on it that gives it a nice matte black finish & rubbery texture that feels good to hold for about 3 years. Then at about four to five years of age it turns sticky and will leave a black gunk on your hands; not good.I think a $40 corkscrew should last longer than four years. Buy a Screwpull or an all-metal corkscrew.$LABEL$0

I have to say that while this book doesn't have the charm of the first, the eeriness of the second, the fear of the third, the adventure of the fourth, or the impending doom of the fifth (whew!) this book manages to push us further down the final path.Easily misread, I had to go over it a few times to finally see many of the clues JKR is leaving us.Great book, definitly not something you can just pick up and walk away with.$LABEL$1

Poor Quality Control. The buyer has to assemble this. Close to impossible unless you have tools to fix it. Screw holes weren't completely drilled. Pieces were not the same length so it did not fit together. Go with another one.$LABEL$0
Good product. Nicely designed. Easy to install.. I bought this tach for my sons 97 civic DX (it didn't come with a tacho). Started looking out on ebay and these little babies were selling for about 35 bucks - so Amazon was a steal at 25 bucks with free shipping.Shipping: It arrived about 4 days later (kudo's to Amazon for super fast free shipping). Package was good - nothing damaged.First look: Opened the package and took it out. Came with the tach, instruction manual, and vehicle reference. Nothing complicated.Installation: This was a breeze. Went online to civic forums and they said the blue wire that my car already came with was the tach wire. Installation was so easy, took about 20 mins, I thought I did somethign wrong. I started the car up and the tach came to life. Have it mounted on the pillar to the left of the driver.Longevity: Been installed for at least a month now and no problems. Works great.$LABEL$1
Ballsy Rock N Roll. This is a great CD. This was my first AC DC purchase a long time ago.. and I really must tell you that it rocks loud, but also it has a song on their that is just excellent.. RIDE ON.I love PROBLEM CHILD and all the other really great songs on the CD, but RIDE ON really puts the finishing touches on a really great CD, and makes it all the better.The CD yells, it cranks, it rocks and it chills out without losing any of its face value or integrity. This is really a great CD track for track, taking you all over the rock and roll map.One of my top 3 AD DC releases!!!BUY IT!!$LABEL$1
very poor quality. this bed lasted one week. the quality was unacceptable. very flimsy and thin. my dog pawed at it and it is now in the garbage (with a huge hole in it). i was not expecting this to last forever but at least more than a week. i want my money back.$LABEL$0
Where Has All the Talent Gone?. Forget "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone". Where has Paula Cole's talent gone? Except for the opening track, it's not on display on this disappointing, forgetable cd. It's nowhere near as good as THIS FIRE.Sorry Paula, but this stinks.$LABEL$0
Doesn't work at ALL and isn't as shown!. First, the clock doesn't have the nice black face with lit up digits, it has a BIG blue screen blasting right in your face, with black digits. Second, mine didn't work at all, completely DOA! It shows all the digits, turns to garble then goes completely blank. Its then my responsibility to not only send the POS to the manufacturer, but I have to include a check for return postage! Cheap construction. Can't tell what the crescendo alarm is, as it doesn't work!$LABEL$0
Fantastic. I thought this film was great and very well done and Julie Christie certainly deserves the Best Actress Oscar, I would reccommend this film to anyone.$LABEL$1
Wow, this sucks.. Well I got this because it was my first guitar. I have to tell you straight up that this sucks. First of all the strings were way to crappy. Like made out of plastic, and they were way to hard to tune. If you tune this it comes out of tune in no time. The case rips very easy and the strap breaks easy as well. The pick's are very bad, they are way to big. The extra strings are no better then the ones of there. I have bought another guitar from Guitar Center and it was amazing. Worked perfectly and it was cheap too. If you want my advice, save up and buy a good one from Guitar Center, because this is crap.$LABEL$0
Did Not Last. This modem only lasted about 3 months. I did buy it used so I can't complain too much. But I was hoping to get a little more life out of it. If you are a Comcast customer I recommend purchasing a newer model. At least that is what Comcast tech support recommended.$LABEL$0
"Autobots, Transform and Roll Out!!!". Rhino has finally come through with a proper DVD release of one of the greatest cartoons of all time, The Transformers. Here you have the first 16 episodes on three discs, plus a forth disc of extras. The discs come packaged in a terrific looking silver case. Unfortunately, getting the discs OUT of said case is quite a challenge...to say the least. But once you do, you will be blown away by the excellent picture and sound quality of these digitally-restored episodes. The colors are rich and vibrant; the dialogue and background music crystal clear; the many laser shots and explosions ROCK! The extras are exceptional as well - especially the clips from the Japanese version of the show. This set is definitely a MUST BUY for any animation fan. ...So, Rhino, when will Season 2 be available? ...And how about G.I. Joe? ...He-Man?? ...ThunderCats???...$LABEL$1
One of the most helpful self-help books I've ever read. Two different people recommended this book to me last fall, saying that it had really helped with their physical problems when nothing else had. I bought the book and was amazed at how easy the exercises are and how quickly I began to carry my body differently and feel better. I've bought several copies to give to friends and all who have read and been doing the exercises have been helped, no matter where they were hurting.$LABEL$1
Nice Moisturizer. I used to use all the standard big brands we are told by ads are good for us and something we need. After being tested I found I was high in some of the chemicals other brands include so I wanted to find something that still works but doesn't add to my toxic load.$LABEL$1
Reliable and Simple. Been using this for the past week while cycling my tank. Has been giving accurate readings so far (I compared them to the readings my local fish store gave me). This is the first tank I've ever owned and I was nervous this test would be difficult, but it's actually very easy. I would highly recommend to anyone. Ammonia is one of the most toxic chemicals that is produced from fish waste, so the ability to monitor it is a great asset in maintaining a healthy aquarium.$LABEL$1
Great for nails and cuticles. This Trind nail balsam is a wonderful healthy treat for your nails. I have been using it for about a year. I have seen a difference in my nails and cuticles. It just soaks right into my nails and cuticles giving them the moisture they need. Highly recommend it.$LABEL$1

Product expired two years ago!!!!. I ordered Phos-Flur about two months ago and I was quite satisfied with the product. Since I moved to an area where water is not fluoridated, everyone at my family started having cavities, some of them for the firts time in their lifes.Sadly, I placed the next order from John Alexander Upperman through Amazon, and this order came in a different bottle, tasted different, and more importantly IT IS FROM A LOT THAT EXPIRED IN 2010!!!Being this a health product intended to be put in one's mouth, selling a product that's expired years ago is dangerously irresponsible. I used it a couple times before noticing the expiration date, I hope it doesn't have any adverse effects in my health. At the very least, it is likely not to be too effective given how quickly the active ingredients react.$LABEL$0
Expensive and didnt' work for me.... I tried Heather's Tummy Fiber. It made my IBS worse. I had more pain, cramping, gas, etc. and I gradually increased the amount. Also I found it expensive. I am now taking Fibersure. It has 5 grams of soluble fiber to a heaping teaspoon and its alot cheaper than Heathers. (And with Fibersure, there is a money back guarantee if you are not satisfied). I dumped what was left of Heather's tummy fiber down the drain.$LABEL$0
Kensington Stereo Dock for IPod. I did not head the warnings from previous reviews. The IPod Stereo Dock does not work with the 5th generation IPods (IPods with Video). It freezes the Ipod or resets the Ipod, as well as scrambling the album covers.If you have an older Ipod, it works fine. But do not buy for the current generation 30/60GB Ipods. Kensington sent me 2 replacements with the same problem. They have no fix for the problem.$LABEL$0

Great Gift Book. "Up To No Good" is a perfect book to give to your own sons! My two teens laughed as I read some of the stories to them. Of course they tried to act like tuff guys....but, looking at the pix just rolled those laughs right out of them. Especially the pig!And as a mom, I feel a huge sigh of releif. Maybe my guys too will be "good men" & can look back on some of their pranks that I take too seriously.Good clean fun with the interesting photos to prove it.Thanks for your interest & comments--CDS$LABEL$1
Great loafer. I LOVE this shoe and hope that Franco Sarto keep making this classic style. My only complaint is that the sole rubber is soft and can pick up little rocks from time to time. I wear this shoe every day and they typically last 8 months to a year. Not bad for a $60-70 shoe.$LABEL$1
Junk Electronic Speed Control. Hi,When it is working, this appliance is great, but in the last 3 years, I had to replace the electronic speed control three times. The funny thing is that KitchenAid, doesn't even carry it as a spare part, (I guess they would rather sell you a new mixer all over again :) )The first time, I really did scramble to find one from a third party and it cost me U$ 67.00 with shipping.Speed control #2 did last a little less than a year and I just had to replace it again.This last year, my wife used the mixer maybe 5 times. This time, I got speed control #3through Amazon.com for U$ 38.00.The electronic on this mixer is made from the cheapest components money can buy; it seems to degrade slowly by itself even if it isn't being used.....It is a far cry from the rugged unit KitchenAid is marketing. Good news; 2 years after installing unit #3 our mixer is still going...$LABEL$0

What a disappointment. What I thought was a book on the history, food, and culture was infact a book on the intricate details on the mafia... This book is a diservice to the already narrow-minded people who think only of mafia when they think of Sicily. I want to learn what makes Sicily what it is. I was even more disappointed that the mafia wasn't left out of the art scene. The author has done his research on the history on the mafia, but if I wanted a book on the mafia I would have gotten one. Perhaps he should rename his book, 'The Sicilian Mafia And Everything It Permiates'.$LABEL$0

Not sure.... I'm about 100 pages in and I can't decide whether to keep reading or not. I was really expecting to be totally enthralled with this book as a result of the description and the reviews but so far, I can't get connected to the story or the characters. I find the concept of the book fascinating but ultimately, I don't find the characters engaging and in some ways it all seems superficial or contrived to me. At the same time, I keep believing that if I stick it out a little longer, I will find it more compelling and that I might miss out on a good book if I give up. My philosophy has always been that I would rather walk away from a book I'm not enjoying or gaining anything from in favor of others that I would find more satisfying. With this one, I'm very torn. I think I may ultimately move on to something else. That being said, if the description interests you, I would recommend giving it a chance; maybe it will speak to you more than it has to me.$LABEL$0

Happy Camper. Set up was as easy as promised. And it does what I want it to do which is to store mostly graphic files as well as Photoshop Elements. The only problem I've had is setting up a filing system that makes sense to me. When it's installed, it's completely blank, so if you don't set up a filing system, you'll find that you're spending a lot of time looking for files. Even though I've complained for years about how MS Windows has set up the file system on my hard drive, at least it was a system. Other than that, it's been great to have and moving large files over to it has made my C Drive work more quickly. I'm still learning, so I'm sure that I'd have more things to say as I work with it some more$LABEL$1
Woodburning. Good item. Used it the first day and it heats well and has good tips for different types of burning.$LABEL$1
A poor piece of writing. I'm sorry. This book has nothing going for it. None of the characters are believable. The story line is simplistic. It is writing by the numbers. Again, I was fortunate to have been given this book to read by a friend, but he did me no favors and so I am using this space to deliver that message to those who want to know whether they should shell out good hard cash to buy this book. Don't. The message is just that simple.$LABEL$0

A Must For Digital Cameras. If you have one of the Kodak Digital cameras that this AC adaptor is compatible with, then get it. It is well worth the money. It saves you a lot of hassle recharging the batteries on the camera, when you could be using this cable.I like to use it when I am viewing the pictures on my tv, using the slide-show format. Isn't that a great feature? It's a great new way to share your photos with a big group of people. Anyway, if you have one of these cameras, then spend the extra money and purchase this, you will be happy you did.$LABEL$1

Not Just For New Workers. Work 101 helped me to see how I could network more effectively and how I could use the opportunities I now have at work. For example, I never thought about how to use meetings to my advantage. I suppose I always assumed that just being good at my job is enough--but not how to let my supervisor know that. Work 101 has lots of useful suggestions for someone who's been in the workforce a while as well as for someone just getting started in a career. The writing style is engaging and entertaining.$LABEL$1
flatulent. Flatulent.a movie chock full of fortune-cookie spirituality. An overly rich, self-absorbed, self-indulgent American woman goes off to the "mystical east" to "find herself", leaving a trail of destruction in her wake, good life and a good husband.what dreck!

Very Nice product for such a good price. Its convenient to use, no risk of cuts as in razors and hair growth after use is very soft as compared to razors.

This book lacks substance. This book needs a new revision. The content and format are OK but I don't think they did a good job of matching up with the exam requirements. This book will not be your only resource if you are to pass this exam the first time. Also remember that the quetions in the bok are not representative of the exam. The probem is that there are not a lot of great resources for this exam but you should consider a different one because this one will leave a lot of unanswered questions.$LABEL$0

The First Christmas Morning. I am a huge fan of Dan Fogelberg! Unfortunately, I had no idea he had come out with a Christmas album until I heard a cut on the radio which was well into the season. I was as usual "blown away" by his talent and immediately had to purchase the CD that same day. You will have no regrets if you add this to your holiday collection -- it is truly a beautiful work of art.$LABEL$1
RIght on Time. The Timex Travel Alarm Clock works great. It's pretty small and compact but not too tiny where you can't see anything. The ringer is loud enough and the time is fairly easy to read. The only downside is it does not have an LED back light to light up the time. Instead when you push the light button it shoots a tiny light onto the screen. Kind of a trippy set up but it works fine. I recommend it if you just need a basic alarm clock to wake you up.$LABEL$1

Waste of Time.... This is the first Dunwich book I've ever read, and I'm not sure I'll be picking up another one. My main problem with this book is the bibliography. She cites her own works and very few others. Where does she get her info? I have no idea. The spells were silly and a lot of her writing was very fluffy and not that original. Save your money on this one, if you have to spend more than a buck, it's too much!$LABEL$0
Schumacher - Fooeymacher!. This guy could ruin Casablanca. He is horrible. Only he could make Cage look like he had just read the script fifteen minutes before the shoot. Schumacher supposedly made a couple of Batman film too. Batman? Ha ha ha. Tim Burton did the only true Batman movies. This guy is just another cheesy Zemeckis clone with an MTV soundtrack and a couple of marquee names. On the plus side, James Gandolfini puts in a really solid performance as usual. There is about four minutes of film worth watching here. Bite me Schumacher. Divide up the bloated budget between three dozen film school grads and let something worth watching be put to film.$LABEL$0
Disappointment Compared to the First Two. I totally agree with "Barry" a previous reviewer who nailed this on the head. The original Carol and Mike Brady actors from the first two film saves this from sinking like a lead pipe. The girl who plays Marcia is good, Jan ok, but the other children are completely mis-cast. The actor who plays Greg acts and looks more like Peter. Peter and Bobby simply share no resemblance to the true characters and have few cameos because of it. I thought the first part of the movie was confused and strained. Better plots are available. Some of the original series plots are brought forth, but never really captitalized on, except for the "slumber party" which was well done. This attempts to be as funny and comedic as the first two films, but fall short in depth and cleverness. Fans will want to see it...but take my advice and rent.$LABEL$0
A Gem!. Truly a marvel of movie making...it's so nice to be reminded of the possibilities of what a film can do. This movie is always a delight to watch for it captures the viewer in some kind of magic as it fully absorbs and entertains one with the stuggles and comedies of human existence...E.M.$LABEL$1
A Cute Little Inspirational Movie. I do totally agree that its about time somebody made a movie about marching band. All these cheesy teen movies about high school football stars drive me insane. There was some good stuff in it.... while I didn't feel it was all completely realistic, that didn't necessarily take anything away from the movie. although I must say, if you found this movie to be the least bit interesting or entertaining, you should definitely check out Drum Corps International (DCI). If your not into paying 98 bucks for the finals dvd, PBS is broadcasting a show about finals in most states right now, and it should be in the rest by thanksgiving. That is some incredible stuff that anyone can enjoy if you take the time to find it.$LABEL$1

didn't last. I have many Kitchenaid products. I've loved every one of them and had no problems. So when we went to buy a new coffee maker i insisted on this one to match my kitchen, even though my husband thought it was too expensive. I talked him in to it by saying kitchenaid lasts forever and we won't need to buy another one of these for many years to come. He finally agreed. this worked great for about 2 years and then i got an error3 message on the computer screen of the pot. I turned it off and on like the manual said to do. then i got a new error message, error2. according to the manual that meant the computer was shot in the coffee pot. I couldn't believe it. I was very disappointed. and my husband is now doing the "i told you so"! :($LABEL$0

Ronnie Baker Brooks - Great Debut Album. Ronnie is the son of Chicago blues legend Lonnie Brooks and "Golddigger" was his debut album. If you like fiery blues guitar with more than a hint of Hendrix this album should appeal to you. Brooks' father and Chicago mainstay Jellybean Johnson both make guest appearances here as well. Brooks mixes traditional blues with a little funk, some soul and a good dose of rock to make a modern blues album in the Chicago tradition. Brooks is a fantastic guitarist and a solid vocalist and with songs like "She's A Golddigger" and "Stuck On Stupid" it is clear that his songwriting chops are top notch as well. For a debut disc, this one is very good and should appeal to anyone who enjoys modern guitar based blues.$LABEL$1

I thought this was a absolutely cute ring when I took it out of the package, I was later disappointed when I took it off and noticed the green ring left on my skin, I can't wear anything but sterling silver so I question if this ring is real or not..still a cute ring but I can't wear it$LABEL$0
Wonderfully Evocative. In this book you are immersed in Paris during the occupation, you feel, see, taste, and experience life in this wonderful evocative portrayal of war time Europe.Alen Furst is a master of the gritty espionage thriller of period world war two. The story of movie maker Jean Casson, hedonist Parisian playboy, and his struggles to live and survive while his world collapses is intriguing and whole engaging, the only lapse is the story doesn't have a strong plot, it wanders and then ends... c'est la vie.$LABEL$1
great product. against advice the FIRST battery tender I purchased was from a local place and the reviews were not so great but being impatient I bought it and paid the price of not buying the best. 2 months later the product stopped working and another dead battery. Even when it did work, the car sounded like it wasn't getting fully juiced on start. So i finally ordered the Del-Tran Plus, hooked up to a dead car to see what the hype was about. The next day the car fired right up and sounded like a brand new car, not a 10 year old garage kept ride. I have been nothing but impressed and would highly recommend it.$LABEL$1

Come Again?. I'm a real Bond fan. Seen every one ever made and have all of them in my collection. I like Brosnan and the Bond Babes. But, yes but. This movie just seemed lame. The bad guys were really bad but not very believable. The special effects were special but not that special. An ice hotel? Dueling super cars? Trans-morphic DNA cloning? Bond getting caught? Give me a break. Never happen. The producers and director seem to be losing the magic formula and trying to make up for it with flash and glitz. I hate to say it but you can skip this one unless you are really bored.$LABEL$0
total Dream Theater ripoffs. It is not unfair to compare this album to Dream Theater, because it is entirely and completely a ripoff of the "Images and Words" sound. If all those tired generic progmetal tricks still turn you on, maybe this album will be OK for you. But in my view there is much more important stuff on this planet: Arcturus, Opeth, Nevermore, Mekong Delta, Therion,... Dream Theater themselves for that matter.$LABEL$0

Love it!!. We bought this gate a few weeks ago because I am 9 months pregnant and have a large chocolate lab that I do not want going into the baby room. However, I did not want the door to be shut all the time either. So we got this gate because I wanted something I could easily get in and out of without the hassle. This gate is great!! It was really easy to install and it looks great as well because of the clear sidings, it doesn't take away from the room at all. I also have a 2 1/2 year old stepdaughter who has not managed to get in or out of the gate, even with a little push. So I am fully confident that this gate will do the trick. I highly recommend.I only gave four stars because we haven't had the baby yet, but I do not anticipate it getting worse...only better!$LABEL$1

Epic.. This is the most recent DVD release of this film. The picture has been restored to a spectacular crispness so, you don't need to worry about missing anything. The film itself is on the first 2 discs, while the third one has some cool bonus stuff. There is also a booklet, which has a short chronicle of the filming process and the last documented interview with Toshiro Mifune. There is no English dubbing, just subtitles but, that's how it should be. I am glad this film is in such good condition because, as Kurosawa said "It is wonderful to create".$LABEL$1
He went out on a high note.. I enjoy these two discs for much of the same reasons that I prefer Billie Holiday's later music. Sure, both of their voices had lost what range they had once possessed. Yes, their voices cracked and were off key much of the time; victims of the addictions which eventually claimed both of their lives. But like Billie, Chet Baker's voice developed an emotional level which often bordered on the scary. Just listen to him on the two versions of "My Funny Valentine" presented here, and see if you don't find yourself wiping away a few tears. Mr. Baker's trumpet playing, however, never seemed to fall victim to his addictions. If anything, its beauty only continued to bloom. The concert presented here was recorded only 2 weeks before the artists death and features the wonderful NDR Big Band and Radio Orchestra Hanover.

Do Not Buy This Version of Metropolis. This is a great movie that Hollywood Classics has done the dis-service of putting out in their collection of DVD's. Sadly, this was my first time seeing the film from beginning to end, and I couldn't do it. The transfer is from a tape (a poor one, at that), the sound is garbled, and is too painful to watch with the lousy video quality. Hopefully, Criterion will do it right. Until then, do NOT purchase this version for anything but a drink coaster.$LABEL$0

Buyer Beware!. These are NOT San Marzano tomatoes - they are grown in the USA. They are not only expensive, but OVERPRICED. This is nothing more than deceptive and false advertising.

Lucy: Very Funny Episodes. These episodes are sooooo funny. You will fully enjoy these.The first Lucy is really funny. In "Lucy is Envious," Lucy's wealthy school mate, Cynthia Hardcourt, is working in town. Lucy lies about that she gives a lot to charity and gets herself in a jam. She has to get 500 dollars! She is paid to work as martians from outer space. They get get 500 dollars, but Ricky and Fred pose as martians as well to scare Lucy and Ethel. The second episode, "Lucy Tells the Truth," is when Ricky makes a bet that Lucy cannot tell the absolute truth for 24 hours. Lucy is forced to not fib and makes it, barely, after Ricky gives in.Get these episodes. They are worthy of five stars.$LABEL$1
Problematic, Offensive Film. Stylistically this film was interesting. HOWEVER. This film is seriously problematic in its portrayal of a trans woman. I didn't even buy that Veronica was trans. Her identity seemed based around clothing and surgery as opposed to an actual gender identity. One reviewer talks about this being an accurate portrayal of a trans woman or representative of the trans experience? As someone who is trans and has many trans* friends, I have to strongly disagree. This film manages to hit every unrealistic stereotype about trans women. I wonder if anyone involved in the making of this film was even queer.$LABEL$0
I've never had luck with Sony products.... There's little I can tell about the 818LP because my set...broke down after roughly 2 months of use.Other than that, I think that in terms of sound, they're worth the price but for a price just a bit higher you can get the Koss Spark Plug earbuds which outperform the Sony 818LP in ALL ASPECTS. The foam covers are not only difficult to put on, they fall off in an instant, mine lasted one week and one has gone missing, making the other one useless as there is no spare set included.Generally, I'm very disappointed with these earbuds, I expected more from Sony...MUCH MORE, but - just because of their sound - I give them 2 stars...$LABEL$0
Works great.. I bought this Wii Wireless Sensor Bar because my cat chewed through the wire on the sensor bar that came with the Wii. This one runs on batteries, but at least there isn't a wire for the cat to chew. There is a timer you can set so the bar doesn't stay on and using up the batteries when you're not using it. One night my husband played the Wii before bed and after we'd turned out the lights and gone to sleep the alarm on the sensor bar went off - it was loud enough to wake us up and the Wii is in a different floor of the house than our bedroom. So turn that off when you're done if you don't want the alarm going off.$LABEL$1
Reinforced tab makes them a bit more sturdy. These are a good choice for file folders which might get handled a lot. The reinforced tabs make them tougher than the usual plain folders.

Another warning - avoid this purchase - wasted money.. Well, I thought I'd purchase this CD collection in hopes of learning much more about contracting... Problem is, most of the data on these CD's are way outdated (2003), so more than likely when you click on a link in the pdf files you'll come up with a dead link. quite frustrating. Another issue that bothered me was that the data DOES (as the previous reviewer mentioned) is simply provide screen shots to government websites. Um, WHY the hell would you want to pay for outdated info when you can visit the sites directly and get correct info...Anyhow, my advice matches the previous reviewers...AVOID this purchase. Do the research yourself.$LABEL$0
Great book if you like touching stories, needs a larger sign dictionary. I started out with this book when my daughter was about 6 months. She has some language delay but started picking up some signs by 13 months and by 15 months she was picking up new ones daily (she couldn't speak any words). unfortunately, this book doesn't have a very exhaustive list of useful signs so you will have to get a different one eventually.$LABEL$1
A Captivating Book!. This book is 294 pages of captivation! Your interest stays with you throughout the book. I found myself unable to lay the book down! Lynn Chandler-Willis does a great job in telling this unfortuante story. Her chapters are descriptive enough so that it's easy to invision what you read. For anyone looking for a true crime story to read, I highly recommend this book! Also included are 8 pages of black and white photos. It was such a good book that I hated to see it come to an end.$LABEL$1
Excellent. I had forgotten just how good Pat Benatar was, and this album reminded me. I never bought a Pat Benatar album before, but had enjoyed many of her songs growing up and when i saw this compilation, I got it, and have listened to it several times since.You can see and listen to the play list up at the top, so I won't talk about that, suffice to say that all of her top 40 singles are on the album. There is also a brief history of her life which I found interesting to read, including her first husband (which is how she got the name Benetar), and the fact her monther was an opera singer.The other thing I took away from this album is a much greater appreciation for her talent. The woman really could sing, in stark contrast to a lot of the acts of the '80s that were all image. This performer had talent and I am glad I am finally able to recognize it.$LABEL$1
MY PHOTOS LOOK TERRIBLE!!!. We have had our hp Photosmart 7760 for just 7 months and already my photos look TERRIBLE!!! The blues are turning green, the flesh tones are fading to white and the entire photo takes on a sickening yellow tone.I AM BITTERLY DISPPOINTED!!! The pictures are SO BAD that it is NOT WORTH spending the money for the ink and the photo paper.HP's solution was to use PhotoShop to add a Sepia Tone to the pictures -- YEAH, RIGHT -- then I'll have YELLOWISH-BROWN PICTURES!!!$LABEL$0
Disappointing.. After buying this book based on the reader's reviews here, this reader was left disappointed.I found that this book was not so much a statement on the times we live in as an excuse for flashy look-at-me-I-went-to-writing-school excesses.The heaps of gratuitousness in this book did not impress me. Nor did the thin plot.I would have much rather spent the time re-reading "The Picture of Dorian Gray".$LABEL$0

Stunning. I had a pear shaped .41 ct Diamond placed in this setting over a year ago. I wanted a ring that stood out from the rest and had a little color to it. I get compliments all the time and I could not be more happy with my beautiful ring. When I am bored, waiting for appointments and such, I sit and watch the light play off the Sapphires and Diamond. The deep blue Sapphires seem to make the Diamond literally GLOW bright white. All I can say is that it is a truly beautiful setting for people who want a little personality to their engagement ring without being tacky.$LABEL$1
great pulley. heavy duty, and very smooth. I bought a pair of these to hang from my celing in the garage to hang weights from for doing lat pulldowns, triceps, etc. my only complaint is that it is hard to get the pin back into its hole after removing the wheel from the housing to put your rope or cable through. i ended up putting it in a vice to hold it together while i got the pin through, but that is the last time i will have to do that, so not really a problem for me.$LABEL$1
Mindnumbingly Boring!. I too picked up this book partially because of the King quote and what sounded like an interesting plot. Boy, was I dissapointed. 4 vacationing Americans make friends with a group of foreigners and on a whim decide to help find one of the group's missing brother who left on a supposed dig on "ruins" in the middle of the jungle, but has yet to return. What follows is page after page of whining and stupidity. I actually hated all the American characters, who barely have enough brain power between them all to walk up-right. The Greeks they meet are actually creepy. The only person I liked was Mathias. Midway through the book I was praying for someone/something to just kill them all already so I didn't have to hear any more complaining or stupid ideas. Horrible plot, way too slow, characters no one should like and the most intense part for me was trying to finish the book so I could move on to something worth my time and the paper it's printed on. SKIP IT.$LABEL$0

The beginning of the greatest band that will never die. For the most part this album this album is one of the greatest pieces of music ever, with little exception.

Best Lord of the Rings game. Everyone who played the Two Towers yearned for 2 player longer levels and more characters, and EA happily responded. First the graphics are pretty darn good, except the in-game characters' mouths don't move, but that's my only nitpick with the graphics. The sound is spectacular, exactly from the movies, which is pretty cool, and the voice acting is great with the actors from the trilogy lending their voices(watch "Hobbits on gaming." It's downright hilarious!). Controls are precisely lifted from The Two Towers, not that it's a bad thing. My only complaint with this is that even with 15 levels, it's a tad too short, enemies can stop your combos way too easily, game can get intense and hard, even on the easy difficulty. But they're only minor complaints. If you're a fan of the movies or books, you owe it to yourself to pick up The Return of the King. You won't be dissapointed.$LABEL$1

Wow--Comfort Food at its Best. This is probably the best vegetarian cookbook I've ever had. The recipes are simple, Jackson's tone is conversational, and every time I pick up the book, I see something new. I've tried about a half-dozen recipes in this book, and they've all been fantastic. So far: overnight cinnamon rolls, dump cobbler, country ham tofu, fried chicken tofu, and the requisite gravies. There are so many more recipes that I want to try. Do note, though, that not all of these are "healthy"--many of them require good amounts of sesame oil and or margarine. But I don't care--what a great book. I've gotten it for family and friends, and my dad (yes, my dad!) even had second helpings of the country ham tofu. A keeper.$LABEL$1

Total opposite of first Fighting Force! Goldeneye for SEGA. It plays just like Goldeneye 007! It sports amazing graphics and runs smooth at 60 fps with no popup even with all the action. It is very unlike the 1st side scrolling Fighting Force, it plays a lot like Metal Gear Solid because sometimes you have to sneak instead of straight on kill everybody in sight. It has multiplayer but I have not played it. Bottom Line: amazing game, good graphics, lots of action, cool weapons (awesome sniper), amazing frame rate, and multiplayer! Fans of Goldeneye and Metal Gear check it out!$LABEL$1

The Waiting Father. This is a very rich book. Thielicke has a gift of being able to communicate and relate the parables of Jesus Christ in way that we can identify ourselves in them.

Thrilling non-stop read. The non-stop thriller is a must read. Especially at the bargain of .99 cents via e-book on Kindle. I enjoy long format books, that you can get caught up in the story. This particular suspense novel borders on a horror. It is easy to imagine what would happen to yourself while reading this page-turning, edge of the seat suspense novel. I enjoy the writer's pace and depth of character. I would compare his style to James Patterson. You won't be sorry you read it, and you will likely get up to check and see if the doors are locked while reading!$LABEL$1

Isn't it NOT a pity ....... !!. Wow!! A tribute album to a band almost lost on the average listeners ears. 'Fragile' and 'Nukleopatra' were stunning DOA albums ... and it's been WAY TOO LONG since we've had something new to listen to. What 'JACK & JILL PARTY' lacked, 'Rocket' more than makes up for. Thumping beats, excellent choice of songs and many different production styles. Yes, some are high-fi (Astromill & Empire State Human) and others low fi (Audiodoll & Giallo) .. but this adds to the charm of the release. Well done to Section 44 ... I think i'll check out their FIXX TRIBUTE next. Fair play for including 'Black Leather' (twiceOh yea - I want to mention that it was indeed a very brave decision to release this album, I'm sure many labels would have thought it commercial suicide but it's looking like a success from this angel.$LABEL$1

Lemony Turns Sour. I don't know about anyone else, but this book was the one that made me completely lose interest in this whole series. This is the most boring one of them all in my opinion, and, well, how many times can the same story be told? Bad guy wears horribly obvious costume to try to get children, children figure it out, but all the grown ups in the world are too horribly idiotic to see anything, even when it's pointed out to them. 6,000 times.$LABEL$0

Did he go off the deep end?. First off, let me say that musically this CD has a few nice things to offer, which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one. But in addition to some of the hackneyed synth lines (which I won't go into since other reviewers have covered this well), he writes lines like: "Bullets for the brains of the atheists".So let me get this straight, Roland: Atheists should be KILLED???Is this some weird kind of Christian tough-love or has he simply gone insane? And there's no getting around this hateful line either: no one can claim this is somehow metaphorical because he precedes the line with "Hey now read my lips" and he then repeats it.Anyone who wants to spew hatred can do it without my financial support. I'm not even an atheist and this offends me deeply.$LABEL$0

A Great Classic Punk Album. This is one of my favorite Adicts albums. If you've seen them live, you know that they sound just like they record and this album is a great example of their sound. It's loud and fun and silly and takes me right back to 1985 and seeing them at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium (twice that summer!). The best are the obvious - How Sad, Chinese Takeaway - but the whole album is great.$LABEL$1

Best of Abbott & Costello Vol. 2. This is my family's second purchase of a volume in the series. We have been especially pleased with both of them. This one is wonderfully charming for us, because it contains several movies by Abbott and Costello that we had never seen before. And of course, since it contains the Naughty Nineties, You get the wonderful routine about who's on first. One of the things that we enjoy so much about these movies is that they are accessible to my nine-year-old daughter. She absolutely enjoys them and watches them over and over again. When you consider some of the things she could be watching on TV, the thought of her watching Abbott and Costello instead is absolutely thrilling. I recommend this volume and volume 3 to anyone who loves good wonderful slapstick comedy that is absolutely perfect for any age group in the family.$LABEL$1
Bad experience with this one. When I first got the drive it worked fine and it was very quiet compared to the optorite DVD burner I have also. But 6 months later when trying to burn DVD's I got all sort of strange errors. It first stoppped burning and now it do not read any of my CD/DVD. The most frustratingg part was dealing with Memorex so called customer support which is like no support at all. I Suggest you forget this drive and get something else.$LABEL$0
Interesting begining.... but halfway through the book I found myself incredibly bored. As soon as her 'romance' began I just lost interest. The farther I got, the less I connected with the protagonist. All of my favorite characters disappeared. I'm probably not going to finish this, especially since many of the reviewers had a similar reaction.The beginning was very good, and very interesting! The story just made less and less sense as it progressed, as far as I could tell. I was disappointed, because the beginning was really engaging!I would give this author another chance, if they came out with another book in the future. I might wait for a few critical reviews though!$LABEL$0
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWN Don't believe the hype.. I can't believe I was reading the same books as those giving this droning tome 4-5 stars. This read like a dry text book from my high school years.

Worked great.. They fit just fine on my 20 year old Schwinn Moab. The V-Brakes that came with the bike were wearing out after 20,000 plus miles. The inset shaft is shorter on these than my originals, so they do not sit quite flush with the frame (hard to describe really), but it is just an asthetic's issue. Funtionally, they work perfectly. It seemed faster and easier (and not much more expensive) to replace the entire brake system that it has been to just replace the pads. It came with one big sheet of paper with instructions in about 10 languages, but there is not much to it really.I should have done this years ago.$LABEL$1

Pure Slumdog Stuff. The writer is re-telling Harry Potter a.k.a Lord Rama - that too very badly. I can't believe how this piece of pure trash got published. From what I glean from this pure garbage; the writer seems to have been inspired by Harry Potter ( Lord Rama), Barbara Cartland ( check out the love scene between King Dasaratha and his long-forgotten first wife for a good laugh) and Rapunzel ( Sita ) and not by any measure, the great Indian Epic Ramayana. The Book is a monumental mouse.BTW, the person the writer calls Demon King, that is Lord Ravana, is revered as a God in some parts of India till date. I sorta like this this chap ( Ravana, not the writer) myself! Ramayana is slightly more complex than a straight-forward fight between good and bad, it is layered and most importantly, a great leveler.Hi Amazon,Can I give this book a Zero?Cheers to Everyone ( except the writer, of course)$LABEL$0
what crap!. the only "secret" is that there is no secret. this book is a marketing ploy-plain and simple. do not contribute to the author's bank account, save your money, and, work hard and honestly for what you need- that's "THE SECRET". the book, the author, and her supporters say nothing new, nothing with originality, and, nothing that is truly proven. it is however, very nice kindling for my fire.$LABEL$0

Good Plot Amateurishly Written. Roby has an interesting plot line, although it leans toward the predictable and sometimes turns preachy. Still, it's a good story with a logical plot and a significant message. Mrs. Roby has the potential to be a terrific writer, but she needs to develop her craft to reach beyond the amateur technique, sentence construction, and punctuation errors that plague her novel and distract from her story. Her natural ability provides a good outline, but her lack of knowledge in the art of telling a good story well proves to be a crippling flaw. In an interview with Mrs. Roby, she proudly said she had never attended a writing course or worked with a writing group. Investing herself in such opportunities for critique would polish her natural ability and challenge her to strive for excellence and craftsmanship. With the odds she's beaten already, what is there to fear from an opportunity to sharpen her skills?$LABEL$0
Wasn't comfortable. This just did not do the trick for me. I'm 5'2", so I thought the mini snoogle would be better for me. I really didn't like anything about it. The top part is uncomfortable to use as a pillow, which is one way it is shown for usage. I have tried bending it all sorts of different ways, and just none are comfortable. It doesn't contour to my body well at all. I wound up getting a regular body pillow and am happier with that.$LABEL$0
Worst of the films to die for. The worst of the set 'GraveDancers' there was not one likable character in this one I didn't care about any of them, I wanted all of them to die, and it contained overblown special effects that were stupid at the end. Big ghost head chasing in graveyard, wow that is dumb.$LABEL$0
Good sound, poor build quality. I've been a Fender fan but recently purchased a Les Paul Studio Deluxe and love it. I like the shorter scale and wanted a less expensive guitar to haul around. I thought this was a great deal - an American made Gibson for $500. But the build quality is so poor I'm considering a return. The fret edges are sharp, and the pickups aren't even installed properly. They're wrapped in shoddy electrical tape and just kind of stuck in there. They move around a lot. It sounds OK, but the pickup selector seems very cheap too, and I'm worried it won't last. I don't mind the cosmetics much - stripped down to bare bones. But it looks like it's just thrown together with absolutely no concern for quality. It's the poorest assembly I've seen on any guitar at any price - except maybe those $100 kits you see in music stores. Not recommended. Try an Epiphone maybe.$LABEL$0
What a great book!. I've never read a book like this before. Not only is it so funny you laugh out loud, but the scenes with the serial killer are so scary that I had to stop reading to make sure the doors were locked!This is a fast-paced and funny book, and I'm looking forward to the second book in the series.

Terrible. This is one of the worst CDs I have ever bought. There is nothing here to distinguish it from other R&B albums. It's cookie-cutter hip hop at its absolute worst. If you want to hear the song "Angel", then download the song and don't waste your money on this CD.$LABEL$0
Great Car Seat, but very hard to tighten!!. I am really happy with this car seat and my 2 year old loves it as well!! I bought this car seat in store. I went in with another car seat in mind, but after talking to the sales man, who is a car seat inspector, he recommended this car seat to me. He said that this car seat is the only car seat that he recommends buying (at least the ones in store) that were a car seat/booster combo. This one was the only one that had the EPS (the stuff found in bike helmets). He said that it could be life saving in a side inpact accident.The only problem that I have with this car seat is that it is very hard to tighten. I pull the strap with all of my might and it feels like it is not going anywhere. It takes a while for me to tighten the straps everytime he gets in the car seat.If the straps were easier to tighten, then I would give it 5 stars!$LABEL$1
CD is great, PBS show was great, look forward to DVD. As a friend of the Marsalis family for 24 years and the President of Basin Street Records (where drummer and youngest son Jason Marsalis has recorded two wonderful CDs, Music in Motion, and Year of the Drummer) I have seen members of the family in all sorts of configurations.Those of you in the dozen cities or so where the family will be performing this month and next should make sure you go out and check them out. Individually they are all great musicians...together they push each other to the top and have a lot of fun doing it.The CD is great, the PBS special last night was fun to watch and I am looking forward to the DVD.$LABEL$1
A true reason why they were on sale. Bought these the day after Thanksgiving sale on Amazon for a great price of 30 dollars in comparison to the original price of over 130 dollars. Got headphones and was not impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. Very low bass and as it is noise cancelling, it also acts as a mini-speaker since it protects so loudly when off the ears. Also within 7 days, the right phone stopped working and I had to send off to Sony Service Center to get fixed. The good thing is that that was a very fast turnaround. Final thought, dont purchase if you are a true audiophile as you will be disappointed, even at the discounted price of 30 dollars. I have had 10 headphones I was happier with.$LABEL$0

An exciting experience. I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud while reading. Michael Tenaglia is one funny writer. The warning on the cover was not true I was not offened by the sex or th violence.The bigest thing I came away with was a desire/fantasy to meet the writer for a late night drink. I mean one minute you're in the middle of a fistfight on a Manhattan street, the next minute your hearing a political rant that would make Dennis Miller jealous, and the next minute he says something so poetic you're stopped in your tracks. Somehow he makes you laugh through it all. Bravo!$LABEL$1
Fairly Good, But Includes Factual Errors. I am only doing the pediatric section so far, but have discovered factual errors. For example, question 155 in the pediatric section: An infectious process that could cause meningitis would have which sign? You have to choose between headache and stiff neck, but either one of these could indicate meningitis. Consider question 205, which suggests that lymphocytic thyroiditis is temporary. No, only the subacute form is temporary, but they left out the word "subacute" -- otherwise it would be chronic, Hashimoto's disease.Another problem with the book is that the pages come out easily, with only slight pressure.But most of these NCLEX books do contain a lot of factual errors. I feel like they should hire me as an editor; the so-called editors for most of these books must be whiskey drinkers.It's a decent book, compared to the others. Not the best, but in the mid-range. I would buy it again, but double-check the answers to make sure they're correct.$LABEL$0
No where near as good as the real shows. The real shows of this were far better. This is a butchered, sanitised, half-baked version despite the DVD claiming to be 20 minutes longer. Many of the performances are no where as powerful as prior efforts and some content is cut down to small portions of the prior pieces heard on DEMOCRACY NOW and found on YOUTUBE. Kilcher's reading of Chief Joseph is murdered on this DVD for a better version see the link on my website [...] links to a youtube from Sundance 2009.There are huge topics watered down or omitted by this presentation. Where is Haymarket ? Where is Alexander Berkman? Why is Ellsberg included ? So many other thoughts ran through my head watching this. Go to youtube watch Sandra Oh's performance of Emma Goldman on Patriotism so much more powerful than what seems like a rehearsal take on this DVD.$LABEL$0
Exceptional!. This is one of the holly gifts God sent us. It's a "must have" for all Seinfeld fans. You can never stop watching those four friends.

Plain, Simple, Boring. This book is filled with information. Information that is mainly useless. I usually read 60 pages a day reading about wine, but I always dreaded having to read 10 pages a day from this book. Everything is repeated over and over again. There is no pronunciation guide, so if you see an unusual word that you do not know how to say, you'll feel like your losing ground by not saying it right. The the main maps of Australia and New Zealand are somewhat decent, but the maps that they give for each region, for each chapter or section, are so detailed that there is no way you can reference where about they are in that specific region. Meaning they zoomed into roads, not cities (unlike French and Italian Wines for Dummies). To cut to the chase, the only positive thing I could come up with about this book, is that it is a rather large book and it would look good in your wine book shelf to impress friends. :)$LABEL$0
Pretty good. When I started reading this book I thought it was going to be another epic story but it turned out to be pretty good. I like the way that Flewelling draws her world and the history behind it. Some of the characters such as Nysander and Alec are a bit predictable but I have hopes that the characters will develop through the trilogy.Flewelling keeps dropping hits about Seregil's past and we just want to learn more about it, doesn't always work for me, but it did this time.All in all a good and fun read.$LABEL$1
Pop Confection Perfection. Of all the Beatle sound-alike artists I have ever heard, these guys take the cake. I could swear that's John Lennon on lead vocals and the melodies to "Vegetable Row", "Homefront Cameo" and "My Before And After" would make McCartney proud. This album plays like the missing link between Rubber Soul and Revolver. The band never really transcends their Beatle influence/obsession which is o.k with me. That's what we have Oasis for.$LABEL$1
Librarian Loves This!. I gave this book to all of my friends and school volunteers who love books. The book pocket in the back adds nostalgia for "The good old days" and is a perfect place to put a gift card for a bookstore.$LABEL$1
The legendary Slowhand. Although I prefer Clapton's earlier guitar driven works like "Stepping Out", "Hideaway", "Have You Heard" from the legendary "Beano" album and "Crossroads" from Cream, this album was what would become a stepping stone to his more laid-back experimental works like the classic "Slowhand" album. My favourite tracks included Big Bill Bronzy's "Key to th Highway" and Jimmie Cox's "Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out". A supreme transformation, true to Clapton's innovative improvisation. I was a bit dissapointed that "Blues Power" was not in the album but it won't do justice to the album if it did since this is a love album. This is an album for circa 70s Clapton's fan. An ultra-supreme album, well-deserved to be a classic of its genre and era.$LABEL$1
Odious, odious, odious!. I had such high expectations for this book, I am so disappointed. I really didn't like anything about it. I read some really glowing reviews and was so excited to find a book that seemed like it was something I would love.I didn't care for the writing, the mystery, the characters, or the so-called love interest or romance portion of the story. In fact I thought the whole story was ridiculous. And the repetition of the word odious was very annoying.I so wished this had been something like Kate Ross's Julian Kestrel Mysteries which I loved. Sadly it was not at all like that and I wasn't able to find anything to love about this one.$LABEL$0
Arnold in Bestform. I'm a very big fan from Arnold Schwarzenegger and I have most of his films. It's a fantastic career he has made.

Great Product. I recently purchased this because I upgraded to Windows Vista and there is no driver for my onboard sound as of yet. So I hesitantly purchased this, and am very glad I did. Not only do I actually have sound again but it sounds alot better than my onboard did. Im sure the X-Fi and other high end cards sound better, but for the price, I highly reccomend this.$LABEL$1

Entertaining, a wee bit far-fetched. Retired Secret Service Agent Swamp Morgan is sent to handle a potential 'firefly' case involving the murder of several doctors and nurses at a plastic surgery clinic. Apparently the doctors are in the habit of taping their patients while they are recovering from surgery and blackmailing them with the details at a later date. During one of the recovered transcripts a suspicious transcript surfaces about a bomb plot. Could it just be the ramblings of an unconcious man, or something more sinsiter?This story starts off a bit slow with the killer targeting the doctors and nurses. But the character, Swamp is likeable and methodical in his detective work. The middle section involves Connie, a nurse who was off-duty the night of the murder and her struggle with being bait for the killer.I'm giving this 4 stars just because the ending was really goofy. I can't give it away, but... Well... It was a gotcha type ending you are either going to like or loathe.$LABEL$1
Continuing his downhill slide. Looks like the Bard from Akron has peaked too early. Has he matched Vacancy or Come to where I'm from? No. He came close on Our Shadows will remain, but no.

GREAT WORKOUT!. This workout is awesome, but only for people who are already pretty in shape.

It is really hard, I'm on my 4th week and it's still hard but it's getting a little easier and I love it. Haven't lost any weight on the scale yet, but clothes are definately fitting better.$LABEL$1
Box Very Damaged, Didn't Open. The top I received looked as though it had been through a war. They either need to change shippers or package this product so it can be shipped more than a couple of blocks.I had this product shipped twice!! The first was returned, the second I didn't even bother taking it off the truck.When I contacted Grizzly they suggested I buy it from a local source. In other words take your business elsewhere. I find it incredible that a company that ships products all over the world can't seem to package it properly so that it will arrive in reasonable condition. The "Shop Fox" supports I bought with this were in TERRIBLE shape! A local merchant says Shop FOX is owned by Grizzly and they sluff off their damaged or unsaleable products through Grizzly. I have ordered the supports through a local merchant. We will see if they arrive directly from Shop Fox in good condition.Shop Fox H2612 Super Heavy-Duty Workbench Leg System$LABEL$0
Wasted potential. I finished this trilogy and thought to myself what could have been. I think the mythology which this trilogy was based on is fascinating. Unfortunately the author tried to make it futuristic. That would have been fine except there was no character development and there was no overall storyline. Perhaps the author would have been better served by writing a series of short stories instead of three novels.$LABEL$0
Shin Noodles. I had ordered this for my spring break for when my boyfriend came into town, just because I thought it would be a nice little treat for him. Turns out they used to sell Shin everywhere in WA. I had never known because they don't in MI. So when he saw me pull this out of the bag, he started flipping out in excitement. "SHIN!!!!!"I let him cook it the way he likes it, and I must say, this soup is better than Maruchan's. Hands down. I would order this again in the future. I highly recommend it, especially if you like spicy things.$LABEL$1
Don't waste your money!. My husband bought me the Magic Bullet for Christmas. He paid $60 for it at a department store. At first I was so impressed by it. We used it almost every day. When we had our first baby I used it to make homemade baby food to save money. I will honestly say that it does work very well....AT FIRST. You'll love it, then be disappointed when it breaks. Before 1 year was up the motor died and it stopped working. This also happened to three of my friends who bought the magic bullet. The customer service stinks and they won't replace it. In my opinion, $60 for 1 year of use is not worth it. You'd be better off spending less on a generic brand blender that does the same thing. I bought a less expensive brand on sale for $15 and so far it works just as well as the Magic Bullet for a fraction of the price!$LABEL$0
Short of Learning Latin, Greek, etc.. Dear Potential Reader:I have nothing but praise for Dr. Danner's _Discover It_. He has taken one of the best methods for self-help learning, the graduated inductive method, and combined it with accurate information about the origins of English words. The reader is led, step by step, into developing an ever larger and more enriched English vocabulary. I would say that anyone who works through the entire book will acquire a level of etymological knowledge and a facility with English vocabulary that normally could only be produced by a course in etymology taught at the college level. My own preference would be for students to learn the relevant languages; _semper nobis linguae addiscendae sunt_. But short of learning Latin, Greek, French, and German, you can do nothing better for building your English vocabulary than to buy and use Danner's _Discover It!_. I highly recommend it.$LABEL$1
Skip it.. This was long, drawn out, and uninteresting. The characters aren't involving, the action sequences are sadly lacking, and the setting is dull. I'm amazed so many on amazon rate this highly; there is so much other good fantasy out there, skip this one and go read something else.$LABEL$0

Disappointed. I was looking forward to a some good new recipes and have to admit that I was disappointed with this book. First of all when I opened the box I saw that this book was a really small paperback book that was poorly made. I was further disappointed when I read the recipes and saw that one of the recipes for the "Best" dips calls for canned bean dip. The book doesn't cost that much but it's still not worth it in my opinion.$LABEL$0
Downright horride!. I have no idea what 989 Studios has been doing lately, the last decent Gameday was Gameday '99 for crying out loud. I'm sorry, but this is horrible. Everything happens so slow and sloppy, they make a big deal about the graphics, but they aren't that good, the sidelines have nothing going on in them, the stands have paper cut-out people. Trust me, ignore this game, don't even waste $6 to rent it, go get Madden 2002 or the surprisingly excellent NFL 2K2, just stay away from this. I feel so dirty!I want a new football game for my PS2, so I've compaired Madden, NFL 2K2 and now Gameday. I have totally eliminated this game from consideration, it has NO good points that Madden or 2K2 doesn't have that's 500 times better. I'm really just stuck on Madden or 2K2, I have no idea which is better of those two.$LABEL$0
Moderately fun and educational. Scrabble with cards! You have to use all your letter cards to make words, beware if someone else completes this task first, as the cards you can't put into a word are subtracted from your score. Luck is as much a friend as strategy, so can be frustrating when someone picks up 10 cards which can be put into words in the first round... and you have a hand full of consonants... I still prefer Scrabble, but Quiddler is different enough that we'll still play it.$LABEL$1

Amazing album. Agnus Dei alone makes this worth buying.. Ever since I heard Agnus Dei on the radio several years ago I have been looking for the vocal version of Adagio for Strings but wasn't able to find I got this CD. To me this CD is priceless. All of the tracks are exceedingly beautiful but to best one is the Agnus Dei. That one brings me to tears every time. I don't know whether it is the most sad song or the most heavenly I have ever heard. It cracks my heart open and ache with it's piercing sweetness. If you are like me and beautiful music can bring you to tears don't listen to that song without a box of tissues handy especially if you are at your pc while listening or you will risk shorting out your keyboard!$LABEL$1
Hightly praised, but highly disappointing. After reading all the glowing reviews of this book, I had to give it a shot...This was quite honestly the worst book I have ever read; at no point did I even find this book even slightly interesting. I somehow managed to finish the book, but with each page I turned, I grew more and more resigned to the fact that the book was simply drivel, and disappointment was inevitable.$LABEL$0

why not set the book in America?. This book should be titled 'Dire' or 'Dreadful'. What is the point of setting a book in London if the dialogue and description are pure American. I love American romantic fiction, I think Jayne Anne Krentz is without equal, so why didn't this Author set her book in America. It is irritating and distracting to have so-called English characters using American English. A little research would cure the problem, witness Amanda Quick, and make the reading far more enjoyable. I gave this book one star because there isn't a no star option.$LABEL$0
A disappointment right out of the box!. Great price but it doesn't work! After mounting this alternator I wondered why the battery continually discharged overnight.

Only A Celebrity Could Get This Book Published. Had this manuscript arrived in a publisher's office and been submitted by a writer who did not enjoy national fame, this book would never have been printed. I am glad the book came to me as a gift, because otherwise I would be seeking a refund. Russert might be a decent guy who appreciates his heritage, but that doesn't automatically result in a compelling story. Devoting the last chapter to the Buffalo Bills football team reflects the author's misjudgment--evident throughout the book--about what readers want from a national political commentator.$LABEL$0

This is NOT a new APC battery!!!. The accompanying graphic indicates that this is an APC battery, but this is not true. The text says that it is an American Battery Company batter and this is correct.This is a not a new battery but a refurnished one as indicated by the many, many scratches on the bottom of the case. There is no indication that you will be getting a refurbished battery so I feel that I've been cheated.If you want a refurbished battery, there are places on the net where you can get them for a lot less $$$.$LABEL$0
Ranch Style trying to pull a fast one. I've been eating Ranch Style Beans all my life and love them. They were made in Fort Worth, Texas for nearly a hundred years. This year, they were bought by ConAgra, the plant was closed and production was moved to Ohio. That's not all that was changed. The cans used to be brimming with beans with just enough sauce. Now fully a third of each can is sauce...they're selling us WATER. They taste the same and for that I'm grateful, but the can says "Beans" and I expect beans...not water. Some slick suit has decided to maximize profit by compromising the brand. Won't work here and I've bought my last can until I can shake the can and it sounds like it has more beans than water. And why would anyone pay almost $50 for a case? I can buy them at Sam's Wholesale Club for $12.00 a case.$LABEL$0
Too bulky. I bought a GBA and accessory kit for a friend I was visiting in France and the 10-hour rechargable power pack fit the game perfectly.

Now I'll have to ...purchase another pack that will fit in the carrying case. I'm not impressed.$LABEL$0
Covers important aspects but lacks depth. I teach AI at the graduate level in a major US research University, and I specialize in the area. The book does cover many different areas of Machine Learning. Unfortunately, the treatment is quite superficial. A student would find it extremely difficult to grasp imortant concepts without referring to other material. It may be a good reference, but I would definitely not recommend it as the main textbook. Unfortunately, there seem to be very few books in this area adequate for a senior or graduate level course.$LABEL$0
boring............ This movie gives a good look at what its like in the modern-day ghetto, but honestly, it lacked the common-threads of a good picture.

excellent, one of the years best. the first 75 minutes was a tour de force, excellent film-making! the end got a little predictable and sentimental, but still good.yes, it's a homage to earlier spielberg movies, especially ET, and a little close encounters. still, the script is outstanding, funny, and heartfelt. the kids are excellent and clever in a realistic way. born in the 70s myself, a little nostalgia is always welcome (i can remember when i painted action/fantasy figures too/model trains... the days before video games and internet!!!!)thumbs up !!$LABEL$1

Roots of Blink 182. Those of you familiar with Cheshire Cat will already know a few tracks on this album, their 1994 effort. Buddha was made during the first year that the band were together, and it shows their tendency toward whimsical, sometimes silly lyrics. It perhaps more accurately portrays their punk roots than the newer albums, where they define a genre of their own. The songs are short, fast and frenetic. The vocals are more shouted than sung.I recommend it, even if your only exposure to Blink is Enema or Mark & Tom Show. It'll take a bit of getting used to, but you'll have a greater appreciation for the band, and you'll enjoy it.$LABEL$1

drama in the chillout. Zen...2 has a different vibe from 1. More European more pop. Inverno followed with Sketches of Egypt followed with Deniz is very dramatic. The downtempo of Vol 1 is replaced by a nod to 80's pop. A touch over the top/camp. Even the laswell/wobble selection is pretty upbeat! Nothing Hartlepool. A theatrical sidestep from Vol 1. Nice but don't expect it to take you where the first vol went. This is Zen as in not. Probably why there hasn't been a Vol 3.$LABEL$1
3D Pro takes you to infinity and beyond.. I had this Joystick back in the 90's when I played X-Wing Alliance. The only thing that could improve it is suction cups. It's good and heavy.

Great movie, poor DVD. This is one of those classic SciFi movies that scared the 'bgeezus out of every kid who saw it in the 50's/60's. After viewing the spectacular anniversary edition DVD of "The Day the Earth Stood Still," I expected a comparable treatment of "Invaders from Mars" (especially for the price). But no ... the image quality of this Image Entertainment DVD is ....: scratches, blips, and poor color rendition abound. An undergrad film major could have done a better post-production job. Maybe that's who Image Entertainment employs? I see the company's Director recently resigned -- hopefully in shame after seeing their effort (or lack thereof) on this project. Great movie, but buy it on tape and pocket ten bucks...$LABEL$0

lacking detail. Some interesting accounts but all too often frustratingly lacking in specific details. Far too anecdotal and vague to be taken seriously as a convincing read.

Ultimately disappointing from someone who is touted on the cover as "the world's leading paranormal investigator".$LABEL$0

Does not work. Put brand new batteries in it. As a test, I set it to change dishes after six hours (overnight). It did not do it. So I tried another brand new battery and set it for another six-hour interval at 5:11 a.m. this morning. At 12:20 p.m., when I returned home from an errand, it still had not changed dishes. It does not work. I'm willing to give it another trial run this evening but based on what I've seen thus far, I just blew $36 on an item that is worthless. (As an aside, I went to my local Petsmart with the idea of buying either one of two different automated feeders, retailing for $55 and $59. The store manager told me to save my money and instead urged me to buy a $12 non-electronic autofeeder, the kind that looks like the self-filling water dishes. THAT spoke volumes to me.)$LABEL$0

I was married recently at age 31 and while I was planning the wedding I was disappointed that so much planning time goes into the dress, and resgistry, and flowers, and, and, and... I enjoyed it but felt something was "missing". Luckily 3 weeks before our big day my girlfriend gave me this wonderful book. It refocused me on what matters. I read it practically cover to cover in one sitting. It describes all the EMOTIONAL adjustments you make -- and aren't really given an outlet for in the frenzy of wedding planning. I feel like I appreciated my wedding day so much more because I read this book.A great engagement (or post-wedding) gift to yourself and your fiance, or to a friend who is getting married. My now-husband found it very interesting too in order to better understand what was going on in my head.$LABEL$1
boring, self absorbed.... She really has a cushy life - how many people could take a year off to 'find themselves', especially in their middle thirties? She eats her way through Italy and gains weight - but hey, she NEEDED to gain as her terrible ex-husband had made a real stink about the property division, and she had lost weight worrying about this. No one else has ever had divorce problems. Well, not like hers as she is so special. She then goes to India to live in an ashram - a Special ashram where only a few people are allowed, by appointment - to 'find God', who is actually revealed to her... (did I mention she is special?) I think she was going on to the gorgeous island of Bali, where she was to find True Love, but I got so bored at this point I took it back to the library. She complains and complains about how bad her life has been. Well, everything is relative but to most people, her life is cushy.$LABEL$0
Barley Listenable. I have tried to listen to this CD a few times since I got it and not once have I heard a song that has caught my attention i find it to be more unnoticable background music anything else. Not worth the time to "really listen" more than once if you can handle it.$LABEL$0
Small, but does the job. Yes, it's tiny. Not very comfy for long sits, but great for emergencies, or during potty training while out and about. My 5 yr old has even been known to use it in an emergency (fear of auto-flush toilets). It will easily fit in a diaper bag, although we mainly just keep it under the seat in the minivan for traveling.$LABEL$1
Life changing. This book is amazing. I borrowed a copy and found what it said to be refreshing and on the money. It changed my life. I became a Vegan (diet wise only) and bought 2 books, one to keep and another to give to some friends. They are now also becoming Vegan (diet wise).$LABEL$1
Batman: No Man's Land, Vol. 2 (2012 Edition). AWESOME STORY!!!I always thought of that about No Man's Land. Is simply one of the best Batman sagas ever.This particular collection, same as the first volume, have a plethora of issues that weren't collected on the old editions. This makes me happy.Something else that makes me happy is the quality of paper they used to print this. Semi-glossy strong good quality paper that gives new life to this tale. Tood good to be true.Last but not least is the cover gallery at the end. Not sure all of it is there, but there's a good amount of covers I haven't seen before.Top notch big book!!!$LABEL$1
GREAT!!. My Dad was an English and Speech Teacher and so I had a lot of "required reading" outside of school. I didn't truly appreciate that until I got to college and the years since.

Disappointed. I was very excited about this litter box based on the glowing reviews. Unfortunately, all the negative comments about this litter box are correct. Even with rolling slowly and tapping the side, all of the clumps would not make it over. There were clumps that got stuck behind and on the sides of the pullout shelf causing bad odors over time. Clean litter also went into the shelf causing a big mess when emptying it. The latches on the litter box are cheap and non sturdy. It defeats the whole purpose if I have to spend 5 minutes banging on the sides or scooping out the extra clumps that did not roll over. After about 3 weeks (I wanted it to work so badly) I gave up, removed the sifter and just use it as a regular litter box. The product was a great idea, just not executed well.$LABEL$0
TERRIBLE writing on a fascinating topic. I'm sure Richard Ellis is a fine fellow. But I just can't understand how _anyone_ gave this book a positive review, and I'm 2/3 through it. The redundancies are ridiculous; it's like he never reread or edited. So on page 108 he gives you a long quote from what he tells you is an article from Roper and Boss -- and in _the very next paragraph_ he gives you _the same quote_ again and attributes it! Amazing! And this kind of thing happens continually. How many times does he tell me how big, say, squid axons are versus human axons? I mean, really: this book went totally unedited. Beyond that the comments of other reviewers that he kind of struggles to fill a book about the squid, are true. Of course some of the amazing footage of the past couple years could've been used to pad it out another chapter, but, there's just not enough there there, or at least Ellis isn't able to make it seem so.$LABEL$0
Sort of like Toy Story on Qualudes. I can put up with the ages old wisdom of scaring the crap out of kids about the big scary world and the nasty people who live in it, and so what if the falcon is the bad guy and the rodent is the good guy so long as there are no BB guns under the tree, but lets have some fun! This is a kids movie. Stuart is sort of likeable and Snowball the cat has some good lines, but I only watch this sort of thing because I am sure I will feel good at the end and I ended up thinking this movie would make kids not want to go outside. Happy I watched it first.Stuart little is a poor stepchild in a genre filled with excellent heartwarming films.(Aladdin, Lion King, Toy Story, Finding Nemo).$LABEL$0

Great Family Movie. While it is based on a true story you can go to the wikipedia page and see that several liberties were taken. But it is what it is and what it is a fun, emotionally moving movie that is funny at times. It is a little predictable in ways and the teenage boy does get a little annoying after a while but its a good movie in the end. I recomend it for any age.$LABEL$1

Graphic SF Reader. Very funny parody tales of a young Hellboy. Various different styles and artists throughout.

Complete waste of money. We bought this product after reading some of the favorable reviews as we wanted to have a seat to take while travelling with our 2 toddler daughters.This potty seat turns out to be a complete waste of money. It is made of very flimsy plastic and the design does not fit ANY toilet seat securely. We tried it backward and forward and each time it does not stay on securely and slips around, rendering it completely useless. Worse yet, my daughters, who each weigh less than 30 lbs seemed to be too heavy as placing them on the seat caused the center to droop.This is one of the worst designed child product I have encountered.$LABEL$0

Caution: Migranes Ahead. This is my second Samsung. I bought it based on positive experience with my first 26" Samsung. Anyway, shortly after setup, a high-pitched squeeling noise developed. It wasn't noticable all the time, but it kept returning under various conditions. It seemed to come from the lower left hand side from rear of the unit. Besides squealing, the stand leaned to the left and no adjustments available. Overall, nice picture, beautiful design, easy to use, but the screeching will give you a migrane. Returned it and bought a 32" Sony Bravia XBR (KDL32XBR4) for a few $$ more. Be sure to look for the XBR4 model because it has Motionflow 120Hz speed and 10-bit processing. HD is absolutely amazing on the XBR4. The KDL32XBR4 is by far the best 32" set on the market. Check it out and compare the Sony side-by-side before you purchase this 32" Samsung.$LABEL$0

Fabulous, unforgettables 1993 Dire Straits. I just finished watching this DVD performance of Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits musicians on their tour in 1993. No, I didn't purchase the DVD for $116 plus change as I am not a millionaire. I watched it on Netflix. I hope to be able to purchase this DVD as it is a priceless reminder of superb musical skill, and yes it is true there were a few favorites left out such as Sultans of Swing, but the intensity of the perfomances were remarkable.If you can afford it buy it. It's a classic.$LABEL$1
great album - intelligent rap. good to hear a rap album not focused on how much of a gangsta the artist, but mor focused on providing a creative bunch of songs with some thought put into the lyrics and music. phrasing is awesome from del the funky homosapien and excellent beats from dan the automator, which match perfectly with the underlying theme/story throughout the album$LABEL$1
Printer not worth the time or money!. I received this printer as a gift. I thought it was a great idea to be able to take the printer to family functions, take a picture, and give it to the family right away! I only had the printer two years, with little use and many problems. The paper that is supplied with the ink kit began to jam. This became an expensive ordeal, considering I could simply take the digital images to a local store and have them printed for as low as 17 cents a copy. It does take up space in the suitcase, with carrying the printer/powercord/USB cable/ink paper and tray. I used it very little and it recently started to print on only one-half of the photo paper! I contacted Canon, after some basic cleaning and trouble shooting. Canon could not offer any further advice, except that I would need to send it in for repair. Since it was out of warranty, and not worth the time or money, it is now in the trash...$LABEL$0

Disappointing production. I'm not a hard core Collective Soul fan, but I admire them enough to own several CDs. I also own the "Music in High Places" dvd, which I was very impressed with. I decided to buy this dvd based on the excellent customer reviews. However, in my opinion, the large concert hall format is distracting from the real talent of the band. The orchestra, instead of adding to the live experience, left me with a feeling of chaos and dilution. Collective Soul is a talented group of men, but their talent is not evident in this production. The "Music in High Places" dvd showcases their excellent musicianship and vocal abilities that this production manages to completely cover up. For a more casual fan, I would not recommend this dvd for an introduction to the band. You just might be fooled into thinking Collective Soul has no talent.$LABEL$0

650 Holster. This Holster doesn't seem to fit the Treo 650 phone very well. The bottom corners of the phone are rounded and the bottom corners of the holster are square. The side supports don't fully hug the phone and make me concerned about the phone coming out of the holster too easily. The top support clips the phone right at the slot for the memory card and doesn't seem sturdy enough to keep the phone in the holster. With an expensive phone like a Treo 650, I just don't get a secure feeling from this holster that it will keep my phone safe and on my belt. I refused to take that chance and will not use this holster. In fact, I already purchased the leather TREO holster manufactured by PALM for about $20.00$LABEL$0

Good music and features Babatunde Olatunji. This is the same CD as "All The Best From Africa" but at a lower price. Why? Don't know. I would have given it a five star but a lot of the songs fade out long before they are done. It has a good selection of different kinds of music, vocal, percussion, string, etc. The main reason I like it so much is that it features Babatunde Olatunji on tracks 2,3, and 14-20. This is rarely heard Baba music especially to those only familier with his "Drums Of Passion" recordings. Some of the sound quality is not that great but I've heard much worse on other recordings. The CD also has squat for liner notes, but all in all, for the price, it's definately worth it.$LABEL$1
Broke within 1 minute. I bought this after seeing all of the good reviews. Went to tighten the boom knob and the knob and fitting disintegrated into a dozen pieces.

great album. I wanna float a quote from Martin Luther King: i am not afraid - i am not afraid - i am not afraid ............ to say that this is the greatest album of 2004 and one of REM's very best. Pure brilliance from start to finish. Much better than Reveal.Also, please give a listen to the album "Lotus" by Elisa. It's very similar to Around The Sun: lyrically brilliant, mid tempo and sublime. She is one of the most talented singers i'll ever hear.$LABEL$1
This is the worst dvd/vcr product that you could buy!. I first bought this last week, and when I played DVD's it made a loud humming/buzzing sound.

Well, when I set up the next one it did the same exact thing. I don't recommend anyone buy this product! It is by far a terrible machine, so avoid it if you can!!$LABEL$0

A holiday tradition!. First VHS, then laserdisc, now DVD. I have 'em all, because it is just that good. (Cher, by the way, was not credited when the show originally aired, but does appear.)From the opening sequence, when one of those military boys gooses Pee-Wee, to the final moment, where Dinah Shore sings to the Pee-Wee mannequin, this show is hilarious and touching through and through. kd lang and Grace Jones are delightful. But I think Charo's performance of "Feliz Navidad" is the stand-out. Brings a tear every year. All that, and a holiday message that resonates for kids and adults.Truly a classic.$LABEL$1

Un buen consejo? No lo compres! (A good advice?, Don't buy it!). Que fiasgo!. Este producto debe ser retirado y si acaso, emitir una versión ultra mejorada pero con otro nombre para evitar desacreditar el nombre Lynksys y Cisco. Recomiendo a los fabricantes que revisen el manual de configuración porque simplemente NO SIRVE. El fabricante debe además tener un manual para configuración manual. Tuve que arreglármelas para configurarlo, porque nadie sin algunos conocimientos de redes va a salir a camino con ese inútil manual. Y después de instalarlo, una lentitud horrible y un alcance pésimo. No amigo, no lo compre, busque otra salida, dese a respetar. Yo que casi siempre me llevo de las estrellas, no compro nada que no tenga de 4 estrellas para arriba. Esta vez no hice caso porque confío en Linksys y fracasé. He pasado una verguenza grandísima por estar sugiriendo este equipo. Ojalá este mensaje llegue a los fabricantes.$LABEL$0
NOT WORTH TWO CENTS. I am a casual fan of the duo. I started looking for a compilation of their greatest hits and came upon "The Very Best Of Daryl Hall & John Oates". I thought great. Then I started looking at the tracks for my all time favorite "She's Gone". It was no where to be found on this compiliation. What? Are you kidding me; no "She's Gone" on "The Very Best of Daryl and John Oates". That song is arguably their greatest hit. Omitting it from the collection is a major infraction. As such this compiliation is not worth two cents to me.$LABEL$0
What a terrible book.. On my age (almost 70 years) and after reading hundreds articles and an awfull lot books about Discus, I finally decided to buy this book. I've read a lot of postings made by Mr. Quarles in several forums and this man gave me the chills. Probably this man is very frustrated and now he has started to offend people very very much. The book is in one word worthless. That's probably the reason of the joker price now asked for this "book". It's nothing worth. Perhaps it won't even light my fireplace. My advice for people who want to start discus start buying books from good authors like Bernd Degen or Jack Wattley.$LABEL$0
Brice Taylor Exposes the Mind Control Underworld!. Brice Taylor's brutally honest memoir is fascinating, heartbreaking, and at times humorous. As a former CIA operative, I can verify that she is indeed telling the truth; all of her anecdotes are right on the money!I am familiar with her case and am suprised she has left out Janet Reno and Nancy Regan's involvement because she has irrefutable proof of it. Janet Reno stained a blue dress of hers with her own DNA and Nancy Regan is shown on video directing Brice's gang bang by the members of OPEC in 1980.Even with these glaring omissions, Ms. Taylor has written a compelling book! A must read! Her experiences in Roswell will blow your mind!$LABEL$1
Korn before they were Korn. Believe it or not this was the band "KoRn" before KoRn exsisted. It is evident in the powerful riffs played by James "munky" shaffer that he influence a lot in Korn's first and later albums. The high energy almost-disco-like drums brought to all of us by David Silveria (now the drummer to korn) are so much influeced buy grove music you can't help but dance. And of course the low clicky bass sound buy Regginald "fieldy" arvizu just leaves us in awe at the end of every song. So if you like korn and want to hear the earlier stuff (w/out Jon Davis's awesome, pain influenced vocals, sad to say) then get L.A.P.D. Some if it will make you giggle but you cannot help but appreciate their talent.$LABEL$1
My favorite vegetarian "meat" product. I grew up on this stuff. It's so quick and easy to use. I love that it's never greasy or funky smelling like real ground beef and there's never a danger of e-coli from not cooking it enough. It's also cruelty free. No animals had to die in the process! Yay!I use it for chili, taco filling, and it's easy to make vegeburger patties just by adding bread crumbs, eggs and seasonings. It can even be formed into meatloaf or meatballs. I've made Hamburger Helper with it before which was pretty good. Its uses are endless. I'd love to try this in shepherd's pie. Loma Linda makes the best vegetarian "meat" products.$LABEL$1

What a find!!. I watched this movie only because Vincent D'onofrio was in it. And am I glad that I did. I had heard of Robert E. Howard and knew he was a writer, but I didn't know anything else about him. This film shows the depth and loneliness of a man who didn't fit in with the rest of the world; and then he meets a woman who begins to understand and to love him, but ultimately cannot be with him.Vincent D'onofrio gives a wonderful impassioned performance as Howard and Renee Zellweger matches him as Novalyne Price, the woman who befriends him. This film is well worth seeing and I recommend it to everyone. It also contains the most passionate kissing scene I have every seen in a movie. I had to rewind and watch it more than once. (Actually, it was quite a number of times!!).If you're thinking of watching or buying this movie: Go for It! But beware, you will need kleenexs at the end -- I did, and I never cry at movies.$LABEL$1
Not Recommended. While browsing on Amazon for free books, I found this one. I enjoyed it until the ending. THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN! Nor horse lovers that like happy endings. It's a good thing it was free, and also that I can't write a note of disapproval to the author.Soldier Boy is Buffalo Bill's horse, and the book is told partly through his viewpoint, partly in letters from humans and partly with Soldier Boy talking to other animals.An interesting tale of the old west, with a young girl named Cathy who arrives from Spain and bonds with her beloved Soldier Boy.I wonder if Twain planned the ending from the get go, or if he just wanted to finish it quickly...and finish off the main characters, too. I'd love to know why he ended the story in such a gruesome way (a bullfight in Spain).Despite my love of reading about anything equine, I don't recommend this book.$LABEL$0

I USED TO LIKE IT , BUT NOW I DON'T. I bought this album at once, back in 1986. AS most Purple fans, I was anxious to have this album featuring their best line-up. I listened to it and I loved it. But after a while, thinking with my head and not my heart, I realised this is not a good album at all, except for "KNOCKING AT YOUR BACK DOOR" (a classic in rock forever), "PERFECT STRANGERS", "UNDER THE GUN" and "GYPSY'S KISS". The rest are fillers, pure fillers.$LABEL$0

Shuts off when listening to quiets parts in classical music or jazz. This thing is ruined by one seemingly small problem: the transmitter shuts off when it decides the input volume is too low. I guess the designers thought this would be a useful feature. Unfortunately, it makes the thing completely unusable for music that has quiet sections -- especially classical music. Its really annoying -- you're right in the middle of a piece and all of a sudden you hear a loud "blap!" and it shuts off. I'm going to try to return this.$LABEL$0
Bad Recording. This CD is a big disappointment. Although the Cleveland Orchestra plays the right notes, the feel of the music is all wrong, especially as far as tempo is concerned. Dohnanyi probably deserves most of the blame here, as he is the one who dictated the crazy tempi and weird phrasing. The second movement is a good example. Dohnanyi seems to be in a race, trying to beat somebody to the finish line. He flies through the thing and slows down just enough every once in a while to make sure the orchestra is still with him. Also, the recording quality itself is pretty clear, but the sound is too bright and thin. Poor.$LABEL$0
I Can't Wait for It. I have watched the first DVD many, many times and still laugh at it. The Color Honeymooners are just as good as the ones made in the 1950s, and they're in lovely color complete with cheery musical numbers with professional dancers and good musical arrangements. It has been a long wait and I'm going to be the first to buy the next DVD, or next 9 episodes. Wish MPI would put them out a bit faster, though. They are light-hearted, fun and very funny, all shot on a stage in Miami Beach. Classic, true entertainment, bar none. I will keep these always and watch them over and over again, that's how good I think they are.$LABEL$1
Terrible Movie. This is a terrible movie. Very slow, bad plot and just overall depressing. It is not the actors fault, just a bad plot to begin with and the acting does not improve.

Cute beads, but difficult to use. My daughter received this bead set for her 3rd birthday. The hand painted beads are bright and attractive, and she was eager to start beading. However, the rough texture of the wood on the inside of the beads makes it a frustrating experience- she isn't able to bead without assistance. We ended up exchanging the beads for a set with a smoother interior surface. My sister also purchased these beads for her nearly three year old, and she had the same experience; her daughter was unable to string the beads- the laces snag on the rough interior surface, making it difficult to bead.$LABEL$0

"lipstick traces" is nothingbut an incomprehensible mess written by an author driven not by the spirit of dada or punk, but buy the spirit of the dollar signs, a very prevalent one in our culture. the ultimate purpose of this book is precisely nothing, except the opposite of what everything discussed in it respected--money. and jesus, if you actually got into this book, get out of the house every once in awhile.$LABEL$0
Failed much too early!!!. Like many others, my tank developed a leak that became worse over time. InSinkErator customer service was horrible and said that their warranty was only a year. Never again! We installed the hot water dispenser from Waste King (bought at Costco) that is available here in Amazon at our vacation home. After 2 years, it performs flawlessly. Besides being reliable, the Waste King is also much less expensive than the InSinkErator. I posted this review on the InsinkErator faucdet as well.$LABEL$0
Poor imitation of a romantic comedy. The people who wrote, directed and produced this movie would do well to take a crash course in Cukor, Capra, Hawks etc. Lazy, unimaginative writing and directing yield a script full of cliches and characters whose motivations abruptly shift directions with no justification whatsoever. Not at all believable.$LABEL$0

Amazing camcorder at an affordable price. When its time for me to replace my old Mini-DV camcorder I made an extensive research whether to buy another old technology camcorder (mini-dv or DVD based) or buy a new technology camcorder (HD or hard drive based). I finally compromised on buying this, since this is a compromise between old and new. It uses 3CCD technology which is cool because the same tech. is used in professional cameras.Am I satisfied with my purchase? A big Yes. Especially the capability to record still images on a SD card at an amazing clarity eliminated the need for me to carry both camcorder and digital camera.I would recommend to buy this to anyone who is looking for a budget camcorder but do not want to compromise on quality.$LABEL$1
nice little vacuum. I bought this based on the reviews on Amazon and I'm impressed with the suction power. I use it mainly on my kitchen floor and it does a great job on cat hair (I have two) and their leftover food particles. It is easy to navigate under the table and counters and also does a good job on the carpeting. My only complaints are that it is heavier than I had hoped and cleaning the filter is messy. All in all I think it is a good value for the price.$LABEL$1
Hilarious!!. Seinfeld has been the classic comedy of the ninenties, for three very good reasons: it's funny, it's hysterical, and it's side-splittingly hilarious. These shows are all fantastic, with the possible exception of the pilot, but, that show is nonetheless interesting to watch. Hours of informative bonus features top off the mix.$LABEL$1

See-saw. I finished this book only by sheer force of will. It was so full of gibberish that I couldn't make heads or tails of the logic in it. It see-sawed between being reverent of Sarah, and then hating her. I don't see how you can have it both ways. That's why I don't recommend this book to anyone.$LABEL$0
Love This!. Very durable dolls. Don't have to worry about finding arms and legs and heads to put back on them all the time. They are very durable and fun to play with.

Digital Logic. I had to purchase this book for a Digital Logic class i am taking. I am not very happy with the book since it does not cover concepts in detail (with examples in the text) instead it has questions at the end of the chapter but they do not offer the solutions in the book or online so it makes it difficult to know if you are understanding and getting the questions correct. It also jumps around in the chapters, no chapter is stand alone for a specific area.$LABEL$0

Not user friendly, Adobe won't offer support. We purchased Adobe photoshop elements 6 and premiere elements 4 as a package in late 2007. It was not user friendly software at all, but after much painful reasearch we were able to perform basic tasks. (The main purpose of the software was to create slideshows and burn them to DVDs, and even that wasn't easy to figure out.) Last year it worked well on our old computer, but when we got a new computer with Windows Vista it wouldn't work. I can create slidewhows, but I get an error message every time I hit the button to burn them do a DVD. I called adobe for some help, AND THEY DON'T OFFER SUPPORT FOR PREMIERE ELEMENTS 4.0 ANYMORE. It's only two years old. I guess if you don't fork out the cash to upgrade every year, adobe isn't interested in helping you.Terrible product. Terrible support. It has raised my blood pressure substantially in the past few weeks, and I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY.$LABEL$0
um... Mr Bezos?. Okay, I was browsing on Amazon, and I noticed that this book was the first item on Jeff Bezos' "Wish List".Jeff, Forbes magazine estimates your liquid net worth at $3.3 Billion dollars. A book that costs $11.95 is NOT someting that you need to 'Wish' for, particularly since you founded the company that is the primary distribution channel for all print media for the forseeable future. See that button on the website that says: "Add to Cart"? Just click that. No need to add it to your "Wish List". Incidentally, your actual "Wish List" at this point should look something like this:1. Telekinesis2. Governorship of California3. Threesome with the Hilton Sisters4. Mastery of all Time and Space5. HairOkay, I'm done ranting.ps this book sucks and will teach you nothing about how to make money in securities markets.

Hard Rockin' Versatility. This album is IT!!!. I've been thinkin about gettin this album for a while now, since I saw a reference to them on the reviews of several other pages (i.e. Limp Bizkit, Korn). Heeding the warning of the man's review below mine, I listened to this album before I bought it; and man, I was BLOWN away. I ain't no christian, but this album is heavy! P.O.D. don't preach, they tell it like it is. Their lyrics are real, not superficial. And man, the U2 cover of "Bullet" was DOPE! Pick this one up! It won't let you down. Listen with an open mind. Korn who?$LABEL$1
Live in Branson. I love all of Faron Young's work. I was especially happy with this CD because it had 3 of my very favorite songs on it. It's hard sometimes to get all the songs you want on one CD. He's one of the truly great country singers & he's missed very much!$LABEL$1
Cannon Battery. I received the batteries (2) very quickly and have charged and used them. They are working as expected. I can't give the batteries a 5-star rating as yet because they must hold up over time and that will be months down the road.

Napalm at It's BEST!. This album truly blew me away in all of my expectations! (Especially since 'Enemy of the Music Business' was not very good, considering how Napalm got better as their career went on.) All I can say is that this album was what they needed to get themselves back at the top of extreme metal. This is their heaviest album to date, so I can't wait to see what there next 1 early this year will bring! Without a doubt, 'Order of the Leech' will be tough for them to surpass!$LABEL$1
No.. I believe that in this day and age, the term "genius" is being used far too loosely. Since when did this apply to a would-be-McDonalds worker, whose greatest artistic acheivement is breaking the record for the thickest makeup ever worn, and the baggiest clothing? I am appauled. I haven't even touched on the "music" yet.The "music"? Well, if you believe that many painful minutes of jangly acoustic guitars, combined with simple rhyme patterns, combined with bitter lyrics about how "I've been mistreated by boys" is genius, well than maybe YOU need to take a look in the mirror, and ask yourself...WHY? Is it because I"M even dumber than my idol?"Rock on!" "DDDUUUUHHHH!"$LABEL$0

Horrible!. I had this vacuum for exactly two days when I asked for a refund. It did not pick up anything! At first I was unhappy that it did not have a swivel head, and that it was very heavy, even though it was a canister. Then it became apparent that it was truly useless as a vacuum cleaner. I must say, however, I was VERY impressed with Amazon's return policy. I entered a request for a refund on Sunday night. On Monday, the UPS man came with a sticker and took it away. On Tuesday, I had my refund!$LABEL$0
Average. Bombay is my hometown and it is also one of the world's great cities inspiring writers from Salman Rushdie to Vikram Chandra and Suketu Mehta. Maximum City is an average work that deserves some attention but not much - it covers the usual suspects - gangsters, movies and the night life - but it doesn't touch on countless other subjects - which is understandable, Bombay has tens of millions of people and each of them has their own unique story. This is not a bad book, but it is not great either$LABEL$0

Immature protagonist. Mother always did like you better; for that matter, so did Dad. This is the theme upon which Harris's new novel is based. The critics are saying it's about returning but it's really about self-pity as well as self-aggrandizement. Every time a problem arises, Mado races to the rescue (probably in an effort to prove to Dad that he should have loved her best)And if that's the point, then Harris failed to show me that the issue was with Mado and not with Harris herself. This felt like a first book. You know the ones--thinly veiled autobiography where the author airs a tired old grievance. And because of her past success, her editor and the critics let her get away with it. She also got away with my money and now I have a grievance to air.$LABEL$0
Total Nonsense.. Don't read this garbage. Robert Prechter has done a great deal of disservice to America, by spreading nonsense material which has no real foundation on modern economic and financial theory. People will get hurt by following this nonsense. It is sad that in this enlightened new millenium, some people will still listen to people like him. Everyone lost money in the stock moarket in the last two years, including myself, but in retrospect the public was blind not to see the coming tech wreck in 1999. But the equity market will recover sooner or later. Prechter is overdoing now, with no theoretical foundation. He will hurt a lot of unsophisticated readers, and undermine our society.$LABEL$0
It sucked. first of all-When I walked into the theater there was NO ONE only me, my mom, and my sister so that gave me second thoughts on how good the movie was. When the movie started I thought it was going to be a good movie because Linsday Lohan was in it- I was wrong the movie totally sucked. It had no plot and it wasn't that funny at all. Sorry, I know i'm the first to write a bad review but I think Freaky Friday was much, much better.$LABEL$0
Another mainstream disappointment. yet again, it has happened. a promising rapper has become victim to the industry. its not really jada's fault, cuz all the money's controlled by only a couple suits at the top, but this album represents everything that is wrong with hip hop today. gimme a break, this isn't music, this is a lame ploy to make money. too bad it had to be jadakiss that had to sell out though.$LABEL$0

ALREADY PLATNIUM?. As far as I'm concern, this poor excuse for an album and a rapper shouldn't even be in the Gold Rush. He's just another tatooed low life who talk like he dropped out of grade school. Bling Bling hip hop is the same as pop metal was in the 1980's and disco music was in the late 70's. it's contrived, formulaic, and shallow music that's overdone without substance. Slimm Thug may be street smart but he doesn't have any book smarts which makes him a slim scrub.Pass on this album and buy some real music$LABEL$0

I love the night light feature and the display lights come in very handy at times. I highly recommend this monitor. :-)$LABEL$1
Great Read, Great Sense of Place. In a former life (as an architectural historian, of all things), I spent a lot of time on the same mean streets of Southern New England as Joe Gunther (albeit with a clipboard and a camera instead of a badge and a gun). Mayor's books are really notable for their sense of place -- I can call up clear pictures of his over-grown millyards and sagging tenements every time I read one of his books.Mayor gets the people right too. Even though his is a cop's-eye view, the villians are not simply generic "bad guys." They are individuals, with individual strengths, weakenesses and even talents.Mayor's books are procedurals with lots of procedure (he's a real-life Vermont constable) and now and then I lose track of a pawn or two in the bureaucratic chess game just because there are so many of them. But overall, an incredibly solid and admirable series.$LABEL$1
Not as good as it sounds. Instead of buying this book, I went to the library to check it out and after reading the other reviews, I was very disappointed. This book has little to do with "sanity saving" it's mostly just letters of unique situations written to the author of this book. He replies with common sense advice and even sometimes advice that "beats around the bush" (indirect advice). For the average healthy bride I recommend reading the book by the Knot (don't remember what it is called but it has "The Knot" in the title). I also got that at the library and it has absolutely everything! No need to get another book. It offers real "sanity saving" advice and some real life stories for all situations. But if I have to say something positive about the other book, it does have a cute cover... but thats about it.$LABEL$0

Revealing what?. The concept of the book is to reveal the errors of Islam, and the author manages to this to a certain degree. Unfortunately he also reveals his own flat-tyre Protestant theology! Comparing words in the two religion's main Scriptures is indeed important and interesting, but the author falls into the "Bible-bashing-mode" so typical of many protestants. He does not know and does not quote any of the Church Fathers' interpretation of crucial passages, and therefore he fails to make his case agains Islam and its literal understanding of spiritual life. It is a pity, because the author is well-intentioned and enthusiastic. But he talks too much about himself and his friends being "spirit-filled", and he never manages to get beneath the surface of the Christian Theological arguments against Islam. 2 stars for trying to do it anyway. Read instead St. John of Damascus' "Writings" in the CUA series.$LABEL$0

Decorative Fishing Creel. When I purchased the River's Edge Fishing Creel, I knew by the price, that it would not be durable enough to actually use in fishing. I purchased the creel for my wife as a decorative creel that she could either plant flowers in it, or use with artificial flowers. While the main body of the creel seems durable enough, the straps that are attached are not, also the way that the lid of the creel is attached to the main basket is to flimsy. "You get what you pay for." I am happy with the creel for the decorative purpose for which it was purchased, and my wife is using it for that purpose.$LABEL$0

This company has no integrity so buy from someone else. I even copied the CEO of the company on my email regarding the frustration and got no response from anyone.$LABEL$0
The only essential study tool for the GRE. After purchasing both the Barron's and Princeton Review GRE books, I found that this book is the only one that is essential for studying for the GRE. While other books contain some useful tips (particularly vocab lists) this official book from the GRE is necessary because it contains real past GRE exams. Other books write model exams similar to the GRE, but because the questions have not been thoroughly tested, the questions on these model exams are oftentimes confusing and sometimes just flat out wrong. My scores on the exams in the Barron's and Princeton Review books were not indicative of the score I actually received on the GRE, only "Practicing to take the GRE General Test" gave me a good idea of where I stood in my preparation for the test.$LABEL$1
One of the best. When I first heard of this movie during the Academy Awards, I was skeptical of the plot because well, how could a person shield such horror from one's child, especially at a time such as the Holocaust? Yet, somehow, this man did. And the reason I feel that it was like that is because it was a relatively short stay. I don't think he could have pulled it off if it were longer. What I love about this movie is that I was touched by it. And each time I see it, I am more touched, and I fall in love with a certain aspect of the film. Despite the fact that I am African American, I can identify with this film, and I give it two thumbs way up!! (Personally, it needs more than five, more like ten)$LABEL$1

Being Part of the Mayhem. I had read all about the earthquake, seen all the photos, gone to exhibits. Still, nothing took me inside the mayhem the dual forces of nature and politics caused as the earth shook like reading 1906. 1906 gave me a great mental picture of the times, and although ficticious, skillfully allowed me to suffer the effects of the earthquake along with the characters. Dalessandro's plot is fascinating, but what I value most after having read this novel is that when I'm in San Francisco I now find myself seeing certain street names and places in a whole new light.$LABEL$1
A Boost for the Praying Woman. The Yada Yada Prayer Group series has been a tremendous boost for my own prayer life. To those of us who sometimes feel our prayers are same old, same old, reading about this group of women who actively participate in a fervent, Spirit led prayer life has changed mine. In Book 3, The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Real, these women have grown closer to each other, and the true-to-life situations, though sometimes seeming to be hopeless, get prayed over bigtime, and with the thanksgivings typical of the group. The women don't forget the practical gifts of love either, such as spending time with Adele's mother who is suffering from dementia.God's answers to their prayers are delivered in His perfect time and way, often bringing surprises as He does for us all.The books are great, and improve with re-reads.$LABEL$1

Howard at her worst.. Linda Howard has the ability to draw you into her characters and understand their feelings about things. But she failed with this book. It was weak.

A powerful man just giving up yea right... Dione is no better.

The "improved" design is a step back. I've always preferred Tampax because they're just plain tampons with no skirts and they don't expand and they're not scented and the cardboard applicator is simple and flushable, but the redesigned ones are everything I don't want. They're also smaller but cost the same. This is the kick in the pants I needed to switch to the Diva Cup.$LABEL$0

Nothing about the security force, the borders and no GOOD footage or photographs. I highly reccomend Amazon customers try another video in stead of this one.

Bernier gives a true look at France's most famous king.. The book, "Louis XIV: A Royal Life," by Olivier Bernier, is a true historical guide to the life, reign, and love affairs of Louis XIV, the Sun King of France. The book actually begins telling of the night Louis was conceived at a hunting lodge. Bernier gives a true look at France's most famous king from his early childhood to his death in 1715 by gangrene in his leg. The Fronde, the wars against England, and the War for Spanish Succession are covered in depth by Bernier. This is the book for anyone interested in Louis XIV of French history$LABEL$1

Informative, beware binding. I bought this book to use for a horse class at a local college. My first warning is the binding! It doesn't take long, or too many times of opening the book before the glue comes undone and sections of the book fall out. I tried my best to be delicate to avoid this from happening but, it still came apart.Some of the information is written in a confusing manner and some things are not entirely up to date. The non-updated information is not abundant and one can still learn plenty of information by reading this book.The book does cover everything from the possible cost to the mechanics of a horse, and many other things. It is a good book to have if you're new to horses. But, I would only buy it if you can find a cheap price on it. Simply because of the binding falling apart.$LABEL$1
Poor quality, breaks easily. I got these as a wedding gift in July 2010, via Bed Bath and Beyond. These just sit on my counter and don't get moved or pushed around much, so they are under minimal use. In Febrary 2011 (7 months later), the largest jar got a huge crack in it, which has continued to grow and has now rendered the canister unusable.The plastic threads on the second to largest size became unglued from the stainless steel lid. Upon examination, I discovered that they had only glued it in two places, with only a small amount of glue.Also something to take note of is that the openings aren't wide; they are about 3.75 inch diameter from inside rim to inside rim. The advertised 4.25 inch diameter mush be from outside rim to outside rim. My 1 cup measuring cup will not fit in the canisters, which is extremely inconvenient.$LABEL$0
This guy can sing!. Jeff Scott Soto, owner of one of the most powerful pair of pipes of heavy music EVER, released his best solo effort with this album. Assembling a fanastic line up (including Journey guitarist Neal Schon, this ialbum is just amazing. THere is a general eighties "feel" to it, but it does not soung dated at all. The songs are well crafted, the guitar solos will leave you breathless.

There is also a DVD/video by the same name available by Barbara Harper for those with spouses and/or families to educate, too!I read this book (and watched the video with my hubby) in preparation for our planned home birth after an "Unnecessarean". I highly recommend it for anyone planning a gentle and natural birth, but also for those who are not sure what they think about epidurals, induction, interventions, et cetera. You may be amazed at how leaving this book lying around the house can turn even a first-time father into a birth advocate, too! ;>)Suzanne Arms' photography is just breathtaking. This book is worth the price for the pictures alone! It's one you can put on the coffee table.Thank you, Barbara Harper and Suzanne Arms!!$LABEL$1
A good follow-up book. This book picks up seconds after book one. By the end of the book I was left thinking that this was a perfect ending to the story. Here again we see Geordi dealing with his love interest Leah Brahams. She has been busy moving up the chain of command and now has a crew of her own. The crew of the Enterprise start succuming to the aliens that set off the Genesis Wave in order to save their dying civilization. Billions are dead and the Klingons are in the unconventional roll of acting as transport ships of the injured and refugees left in the wake of a massive evacuation that has decimated much of the alpha quadrant.Makes a nice tie-in to the Star Trek S.C.E. series.$LABEL$1
Fascinating Art Gem. Informative reading and interesting to look at, The small format restrict some of the details of Bruegel's intricate artwork. But for the price and the amount of photos ( and some excellent details ) it's a treasure of a handi-referednce book. Highly recommend$LABEL$1
Send a message: We are not fools!. DO NOT BUY THIS RELEASE!! Send a message to the industry that we are not stupid enough to fall for their marketing ploy of selling us a regular version and then selling us the extended version we really want (and which is already available on standard DVD.Those of you who fall for this scam...I'll bet you also fell for Apple's scam and bought an iPad already!$LABEL$0

Data-mining Project. I gained little from reading this book.

not a well-made set. I bought this for my son who likes to create art. I figured the handy case would be easier for travel as it would contain everything he needed. Well, it stinks. The inside liner of the case falls out, the paint rounds dont stay in their plastic container at all. So you have to constantly put them back in everytime you open or close the case. This case is not worth it! My son just took all the stuff out and put it in other containers because he was tired of dealing with it.$LABEL$0

Amazing Classroom Tool. I am an instructional asst. in a Special Ed. class for emotionally disturbed kids aged 8-11. Most of our kids are on meds for their severe behavior problems. I listened to SOOTHING MOMENTS and loved it so I decided to try it out in my classroom. I was amazed and grateful when I turned on the CD and the entire class calmed down. Now, it is a part of our classroom schedule. We listen to it twice a day on a regular basis. The students even request it now on their own for their quiet time. SOOTHING MOMENTS has become one of our most effective tools in our classroom. Amazing!!!$LABEL$1

Go to the movie-theatre instead. This is really no good... The whole book (and all the others in the series) coul be directly used as manuscripts for bad Hollywood movies...

Come on, what a disappointment. Why do the authors in the fantasy have this new 'cool trend' of writing huge 'epic' series filled basically with subplots and only a nebulous main theme?All the so-called 'fantasy kings'- Jordan, Terry Goodkind and now GRR Martin have disappointed me greatly. The 'epic' style is very unsatisfactory, more like a soap opera than an epic. Tolkien wrote epic and grand stories, but were they neverending, rambling creations? I had more hopes for this particular series but the author appears to be squandering it away with another Jordan-like fiasco. If you want tightly woven, well-written fantasy, don't expect to be satisfied here. Look at Pullman's provocative and beautiful His Dark Materials, or Ursula K Leguin's thoughtful trilogy. Or go back to the major figure in the genre, Tolkien, and see why these authors are worth reading. These books are more like Swords-and-sorcery Grisham then fantasy. The genre really is going downhill.$LABEL$0
Excellent field guide great pictures & information!. This field guide on snakes is excellent. The pictures of each snake are clear and you can identify them easily when you see them in the wild (or in you're house). The organization of this book splits up into two sections venomous and nonvenomous which allows a very quick way to tell if you should be anywhere near the snake. The infromation on each type is plentiful and everything you need to know is included. There are maps of where to find each type and whether they are endangered or protected in the state of Texas. A system is given in the beginning of the book for how to easily determine a snake and also what to do if you happen to be bit by a venomous type. The only thing I would like to see in the next revision is the striking distance of each snake which isn't given in this book.$LABEL$1

The theory sounds good but it's too hard to follow. This diet sounds good. The theory seems sound. The idea is simple. But putting the theory into practice was just too hard for me. I'm a mom and wife, and trying to get my family to adjust to something this extreme was simply not reasonable. As it was, I found it almost impossible to get through the day without some form of carbos, and I'm not talking needing big dishes of ice cream, even a simple bowl of rice would have been welcome! As well, I found the lack of fiber in this diet to be a real drawback, and the suggestion to use things like Metamucil and take large quantities of vitamins to be unrealistic. The key to real weight loss seems simple, eat less, exercise more. This diet just didn't cut it for me.$LABEL$0
DO NOT TOUCH!!!!. I happen to be a fan of Fred Olen Ray's movies, but you must fight all urges to buy this one, folks. First of all, the picture quality wasn't that great. I've seen worse, but it is poor quality and very grainy (which suprises me given the good quality of other Retro Media titles). Next, the acting is atrocious. I can usually deal with bad actors and actresses (as I said earlier, I'm a fan of Fred Olen Ray's movies) if the plot is decent enough or if the story is at least entertaining enough. But this is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen! There are no, I repeat, no redeeming qualities in this movie. So, why did I give it two stars you ask? The extra materials, that's why. There are some pretty neat things on the rest of the DVD (such as Nite Owl Theater bloopers, outtakes of the movie, and, of course, a new episode of Nite Owl Theater). But believe me, it is not worth the price of the DVD. STAY AWAY!!!!$LABEL$0
Compares to P.G. Wodehouse. The highest compliment I can pay this book is that it is the only American work that truly bears comparison to the great P.G. Wodehouse. Dobie, though far from a confirmed bachelor, captures some of the inspired daftness of Bertie Wooster's narration of his own impossible adventures.I loved this book when I was a teenager forty years ago, and loved it just as much when I reread it last year. Don't make the mistake of confusing these brilliant stories with that dopey sitcom. You won't go wrong with this one.$LABEL$1
Woolley gives J.C.B. his due at last. Robert Woolley presents a fine rendition of these Op. 17 sonatas on a fortepiano built at around the time of J.C. Bach's death. He endows them with feeling and humanity without a lot of overindulgence in rubatos or other mannerisms. The "prestissimo" movements of sonatas 2 and 6 are especially good, played with breathtaking virtuosity. And as Woolley demonstrates, there is an excellent case to be made for J.C. Bach as a worthy composer in his own right, and not just "another son of J.S. Bach" or "a precursor of Mozart." Highly recommended.$LABEL$1
Paste is better!. Product arrived considerably later than other items I had ordered. I applied it to my wet hair afer showering and disliked it immediately! It's heavy and barely scented. The scent itself lasts only minutes. The paste is much lighter on my hair and its scent lasts for hours! Wet your palm before adding the paste (tiny dab) and then rub in. Holds well and smells fresh and healthy.$LABEL$0
Two hours!. It took two hours for Ralph Fiennes whose blindness isn't even noticeable to ask Natasha Richardson who is nothing like a Russian to "date" him. OMG. This movie is ridiculous. I can't believe this was a Merchant and Ivory movie because the cinematography was so clumsy. Most of the shots were small screen quality but less interesting and creative than Jerry Bruckheimer produced small screen fare. I'm sure people who are interested in wartime era Shanghai/expat culture will give this movie a scan but for the rest of us, OMG. Ralph Fiennes rarely has chemistry with anyone. I have no idea why he found Natasha Richardson compelling. The costumes were not flattering. This movie was more boring than the not that interesting Naomi Watts in wartime Shanghai movie, The Painted Veil. OMG.$LABEL$0

A real disappointment. I like Linda Howard and have read all her books but Open Season is bad. The book cover reads `Seamlessly blending heart-pounding romance and breathless intrigue'. Seamlessly blending it was not. It took Ms. Howard twelve chapters to remember there was suppose to be some intrigue in this book. And calling it intrigue is really stretching it. The ending was also a disappointment. It's as though Linda Howard knew how bad the book was and just wanted to get is over with. There is no comparison between Mr. Perfect and Open Season. Mr. Perfect I recommend, Open Season - forget it.$LABEL$0

Classic Television Drama @ its finest!!!!!. I used to enjoy this show. Ienjoyed the actors as well they did a good job. I definitely liked the drama and the suspense it was done very well. Dallas was a popular Television show and a lot of people watched it. The show had great production and actors. I liked Victoria Principal (Pam Ewing) who was married to Bobby Ewing and had a son named Christopher. But the most infamous one of the main characters J.R. Ewing (Larry Hgaman) the son of Mary Martin (Peter Pan). J.R. kept the drama going he and Sue Ellen duked it out so much . I really did enjoy this show and therefore I would recommend anyone who likes Classic Soap Operas or Dramas to purchase this item it is very enjoyable.$LABEL$1
Waste of money. I am a new hamster owner and this cage was my first mistake. I have a Teddy Bear hamster and she is still a baby, just a couple of months old. This cage is way too small for her. The pieces are very brittle and break easily. The ball doesn't turn very smoothly or easily and of course is a little noisy. I wish I could put a regular wheel in here, but can't because of the pyramid shape of the cage. All of the accessory pieces you can buy for this are total junk too. The tubes don't stay together and fall apart once my hamster crawls inside. Not a good buy. I just bought the Jack 72 Hamster Resort and hope it works out better!$LABEL$0

Unreliable Product. I bought this product with a life-and-death importance. My rescue Great Dane is aggressive toward cats. I tried the collar on myself and turned the shock rating up to 5 before I got a little jolt. Then I tried it on my dog and calibrated according to the instructions. I presented the cat and got limited reaction even on the highest 10 setting. I tried the collar on myself on bare skin. I felt a shock about one in four times -- on my bare skin.This product is unreliable.$LABEL$0

AGONY AND ECSTASY. IN 1967 THE MOTTO WAS NO PAIN NO GAIN. GIVE IT YOUR ALL, GIVE IT ALL YOUVE GOT AND YOULL GET ALL IN RETURN. ALL MEMBERS OF THE GROUP WERE PUTTING THEMSELVES INTO THEIR MUSIC AND WORK 110% . THE FURIOUS FIVE HAD A STROKE OF MAGIC THAT WAS TOO HOT TO THE HUMAN TOUCH.

Misery Bay and Other Stories from Michigan's Upper Peninsula. "Lauri Anderson's latest collection of poignant stories is a wonderfully rewarding read. These stories are not only dedicated to the Copper Country, but truly celebrate the Finnish character that has played such an important part in creating a Copper Country heritage. Here are our heroes, survivors against all the odds, in this remote land, true to themselves acting with an unconscious humility. These often bittersweet stories are set in historic contexts that make them utterly convincing. There are many literary allusions, and even characters such as Vainamoinen and Hemingway play a part. The clean rhythm of the language mimics the Finnish language and underlines the basic humanity and individuality of these Copper Country Finns."$LABEL$1

Meerkat Manor Season 1. Being a South African I have a huge interest in the Meerkat as they are my favourite animal. Some of the farming community come across little one's in the veld left behind on their own and the farmers raise them by hand and keep them as pets. They are not kept in cages and they are loved and taken care of very well. We suspect the Meerkat are left behind homeless possibly due to their parents being killed by other animals or what we experience mostly is road kill. However, I found the DVD's extremely interesting. Wonderful footage and beautiful photography. It's almost like watching a "soapie"! I laughed and cried at the same time especially when my favourite character, Shakespeare was bitten by a snake. Although Shakespeare recovered, he later dissapeared from the scene and it was not mentioned what happened to him? Overall I am very impressed.$LABEL$1

Barely informative, terribly written. I thought this book must have been a rush job, written to capitalize on Martin's death-- it reads like it was thrown together in a week.The writing is awful-- sentences that are almost incomprehensible, non-sequitors abounding, a smarmy tone in an attempt to sound jaunty, many facts questionable if not downright wrong (The Lewis/Martin reunion was on the MD telethon not the "Frank Sinatra Show"-- whatever that was) .

Christopher Decker's Biased view. True, the book is an good compilation of the various Fitzgerald translations of the Rubaiyat by Omar Khayyam, yet the editor, Christopher Decker, gives an extremely rude, biased veiw of the Islamic belief. Decker unneccesarily gives his enraging opinions, for example, he calls Prophet Mohammed (SAW) a "false prophet" of the Muslims. He openly attacks Muslim customs and beliefs, calling the Muslim calendar "clumsy". The editing is very unprofessional. Also, he attacks the Muslim Holy month of Ramadan. Fitzgerald is to be given positive credit for this book.$LABEL$0
What an excellent revival!!!!. I loved this game back in the olden NES days. When this game came to the GBA I was very impressed with what has been done with it, there is no downfalls, only improvments!!

I just wanted to add two things:1.) I never use the leveler2.) If you use particularly scratchy sponges to scrub your dishes, you might find that the labels eventually get worn down on these. They do go in the dishwasher, by the way... but *I* don't have the time to do that, because I use mine way too often!$LABEL$1
Failure to deliver on the goods. I love my Ipod model of this product. It suprizes me that Belkin wont get its delivery date right. When you tell someone a date better make sure it it at least close. I have been trying to get this product since November. Then I found it on Amazon. Then as Belkin did last week. The week before shipment they changed the date by 2 months. Unacceptable for me and should be to Amazon also. I only hold Belkin to blame for this. I have bought many things from Amazon. They only tell you what is relayed to them. I wonder how many of these will sell by March this time. Or will it be delayed again. An upset Zune owner.$LABEL$0
This is an ordinary card, nothing special. The VIA chipset is strictly for low level work = 2 video streams max throughput. Better to find a card with the Agere' or Lucient chipset which can pass as many as 8 video streams at once. The price is OK, but you can do better for the same elsewhere. Easy install? All modern FireWire 1394a and 1394b cards are plug and play = no driver required, so this is no advantage here. Reliability? you would be better off finding a card with internal power connector as the FireWire 1394 power drain can be quite a strain on cheap PC motherboards, especially with external drivers and burners.$LABEL$0
Another awful printer from Suxmark. I'll keep it short and sweet: you buy cheap, you get cheap. I only purchased the 1100 Jetprinter as my Epson Stylus Color IIs died on me and I needed something immediately to print a report for school. What a waste of hard-earned money: don't even waste your time comparing this product to other printers, go with an HP or Canon instead. With the 1100, I experienced frequent paper jams, especially with size 10 envelopes, and it went through ink faster than my Epson Stylus Color IIs or my Lexmark z23.

Wafer-thin layer of fleece. I bought one of these pads a couple of months ago and it was nice enough before being washed.

Make sure you buy the 2nd Edition. Most of the reviews here seem to relate to the first edition (which was admittedly kind of short). The book has been updated, and the second edition covers new stuff like XSD Schemas, Diffgrams, SOAP Virtual Names, and all the other SQLXML 3.0 features. I found the book really useful, and easy to read. The examples are great and the concepts are all well explained. Definitely worth buying if you're planning to use SQL Server's XML functionality.$LABEL$1
Poor Quality. This is the second HeartRate monitor I've owned. My first was a Polar model, which I unfortunately lost during a move.I bought this Omron HR-100C model primarily due to its price, and also seeing that it was a best-seller on Amazon. Unfortunately I've found the quality lacking. Particularly when trying to switch between HeartRate and other modes, the watch will beep when the button is pressed, but won't always change modes. (It takes repeated presses of the button to change.) This is especially frustrating when you're riding and trying to fiddle with the fool thing.If all you need is a basic HR monitor, this will work. But if you also want to see the time, or use the stopwatch, I would look elsewhere.$LABEL$0

The BEST Album By Madonna. Erotica has got to be Madonna's best album!! This album explores every aspect of sex while giving you great rhythm and awesome dance songs... Deeper and Deeper is a reflection of the club scene in the 70's with a twist of the 90's and a great beat... Madonna is one of the most influential artists and this is one of her most influential albums because it showed that women can be sexually provocative...$LABEL$1
Worthless Drivel. Despite the endless high brow rhetoric and circular reasoning of Darwinists, the simple fact is Dawkins and his diciples of the church of naturalism can't explain the absolute origin of anything, even a hydrogen atom, let alone the universe. True, empircal evolution (i.e. adaptation, speciation, selection, and genetic drift) is all well and good - and irrefutable - but it has zip to do with origins, and will remain a delusional fantasy for those who reject the Biblical record of sudden creation and the subsequent global water catastrophe. Life is short, truth will be revealed to all - some only get it after death.$LABEL$0
New Found Stardom. This has to be one of my favorite albums of all time. Basically, it's five Florida natives taking half an hour to share their interpretation of punk music at its best...and they succeed. You've got Jordan belting out lovesick anthems like "Eyesore" and "All About Her", then switching to funnier moments with "Boy Crazy" and "Sucker for a Kiss". "Ballad for the Lost Romantics" pretty much ends a great album. If I sat here any longer, I'd name all the tracks and give you reasons why they rock, so buy the CD and wear it out. I guarantee that if they don't become one of your favorite bands, they'll give you thirty minutes of damn good fun.$LABEL$1

Don't buy this. This thing is garbage. It's flimsy, it takes two hands to release they very small buttons. The buttons do not release or lock well. The assembly instructions are lame. I am throwing this in the trash, it's not even good enough to donate to Goodwill.$LABEL$0
Planet Bike Protege 9.0. So far I love the Planet Bike Protege 9.0. When I installed it and tried to take it off (very hard to get off), I thought I broke it ,I didn't. The other night I got my bike ready to take with me to work the next day so I could ride it at the park and completely forgot to protect it from the dew. When I got off of work, I checked it and was working great! I had bike tire issues (note to self, don't air up the tires to the maximum p.s.i that is on the tire) so I haven't really gotten to test it out much. One tip is you push it from the bottom to the top to reset it. I was trying to push down and then up at first and couldn't figure out why it wasn't changing. To reset it, just keep pushing until completely 0's out. I don't think it was very hard to install on my mountain bike. It took me about 20 minutes to install and adjust it.$LABEL$1
unspectacular. I'd written a review for this game when I was in the middle of playing it. When I finished, I wished I hadn't spent the time. Here's the deal... I hated almost every character in the game. They were annoying! How are you really expected to enjoy a gaming experience when you hate all the characters you play as?What I liked in the game was the deep story, and I loved the combat system. Combat was actually a lot of fun. The graphics were nice too.What I hated involved all the characters and the way they reacted to things. In fairness, there were a couple of characters I liked, like Bebedora (sp?). It may be an unfair comparison, but in games like Final Fantasy, you can go back to various areas, and there's all sorts of side quests and weapons you can get. It gave the Final Fantasy series a lot more depth.Ultimately, this could have been worse, but if they'd just made the characters interesting, it would have been a lot better.$LABEL$1
Good keyboard but over time letters wear off. My husband is a "hunt and peck" typer. One of our computer desks is in our bedroom. My husband always had to have a light on when I was trying to sleep when he was on the computer working, so he could see what he was typing. I bought him this Saitek keyboard for Christmas last year (2007). Our entire family, including children love this keyboard and it is used several hours a day. The only issue I have is, after ten months the paint is wearing off of the frequently used keys. It's not a problem for me, but the "hunt and peck" typers I live with will eventually have a problem. It's still a good keyboard and I may try to put permanent marker letters on the keys eventually and see how that works. Overall a good product. Even if I have to purchase another one eventually, the light is off when my hubby is typing. I'm happy!$LABEL$1
As in all of Crichton's books, you learn something while being entertained.. Michael Crichton excells at teaching you while you are reading (or in my case, listening - I heard it as an audiobook read by Blair Brown).In this case, Crichton tells us about the world of airplane design and construction. However, the more compelling story is that of the news media getting the story wrong due to lazy work - the same theme as is developed in "The State of Fear." Seeing stories that are produced on the local level in my city about items that I have personal knowledge of, I cannot say that I disagree.Entertaining, informative read.Final grade: B+$LABEL$1
This is the same track list as the Best Buy version! Don't blow your money!. Yes indeed, the bonus track on the Japanese version, selling here for 45 bux, is the same Snoop Dogg collaboration that is on the exclusive Best Buy version of this CD that you could get for like 9.99 on sale when it first came out. If you haven't already splurged on this edition, just save yourself 30-35 dollars and head over to your nearest Best Buy....$LABEL$0
Just Another Musical. I found this film to be average. I find most musicals (especially MGM productions) to be tedious, so that probably contributes to my lack of enthusiasm for it. The only redeeming aspect of this movie is Gershwin's great music. For fun with friends, or by yourself, wait for the "An American in Paris" ballet at the end of the film. When the section comes on, where Gene Kelly is dressed in an off-white outfit, and wearing a Ty Cobb style baseball hat, watch with the sound off.$LABEL$0
No good product. Used to be a loyal sony customer as all me previous products were close to invincible. So I went out of my way to purchase a sony for my first camcorder. Took it home and turned it on... then it died on me. Yep right there and then, no abuse nothing, just died on me. The customer service apologized but didn't do much. To me I cannot fathom how sony is staying in business (i wish I read these reviews here first before I made my decision, as obviously they are going on a downhill trend as far as quality is concerned) with kind of quality. I will never buy another sony product again and will make sure no friends of mine make that mistake.DON'T BUY!!$LABEL$0
silly, save your time and money. I don't understand the 5 stars this book earned, which was the reason I purchased this book. I found the humor sophomoric, dog flatulence is not funny to me. The heroine was silly, she reminded me of Lucy in the "I Love Lucy" series. No suspense, the villain was obvious. I did read the entire book and just did not see the humor or substance the other reviewers rave about.$LABEL$0
awful product. Came without the battery cover so sent it back... these guys have a cheap product, don't bother. Overall product quality was very subpar. The plastic felt cheap and not watertight at all. On top of that the packaging looked like someone had opened it before me. Likely returned it as well?$LABEL$0
Another Great Book by Lnysay. I received this book on my kindle but have not had a chance to read it yet, but knowing the other books by Lynsay, I know this one will be just as good.$LABEL$1
no information. I would have bought this item the first time I saw it, if not for the lack of information. Other pages have a list of items included in the package whereas this one has none. Who's to know what you're getting? I suggest that this seller at least place an overview of the items the recipient will be getting when ordered.$LABEL$0
An unessential release. With every release, these kings of emo get more mundane and self absorbed. Typical fugazi songs that go nowhere new, which isn't necessarily a bad thing except that all their sheep-like fans always claim that fugazi is so cutting edge. Same old discordant clanging guitars, sort of funky bass work, and preachin'. Ugghh. How can a band be so self righteous and PC when their front man was fined for dumping oil from the fugazi van into a stream in Northwest DC?$LABEL$0
Yes, and you can too!. Jez Alborough is among my favorite authors of children's books. In this book he has imagined a tale so eloquent and so memorable that it will quickly become a family favorite. The illustrations are beautifully painted, made especially vibrant because of Alborough's heavy use of greens and blues. The author has perfectly imagined the characters expressions, from curious glances and despondent faces to joyous looks of wonder and satisfaction. This book has to be read aloud! Having presented this title dozens of times to numerous audiences, I can tell you that this is among the best books I have read to children and their parents. My audiences always applaud my telling of this book, largely I think, because of the passion I put into reading it, which is made easy by the rhythmic text and the dialogue that begs to be voiced. The surprise ending is always a hit with my listeners and brings relevance to the title. This is a must-have title for your child's library!$LABEL$1

McCulloch Steam Cleaner - product defective. McCulloch MC1275 Steam Cleaner. I received this product almost immediately - shipping was very fast. The product was packed very well - every part was individually wrapped and secured within the box. Unfortunately I never got a chance to use it. You have to assemble the handle on top - which holds the hand piece and is the only means for lifting the cleaner to move it around. However, the handle could not be affixed according to the instructions. The holes for the screws and the screws were out of alignment and there was no way to force them into place without causing more damage. I returned the product the next day.$LABEL$0
Not the item in the picture when ordered.. If I'm not mistaken the item in the picture is solid black. The glasses I received have a clear tint at the bottom which I was not happy with. Will be returning this item. They did fit nicely, but as I mentioned I wanted solid black all around not just on 3/4 of the shades.$LABEL$0
Same old, same old. Yet another "authoritative" tome on behavior modification. The title of the book made it sound interesting, but upon closer scrutiny its tired, teacher-in-control theme reared its ugly head. It's amazing that years after more effective models of classroom management have been devised, implemented, tested and their effectiveness confirmed (both by teacher/administrator evaluations...AND independent research studies), the Skinnerian behavior modification model still reigns supreme. If you must buy this book, do yourself a favor and also check out Beyond Discipline by Alfie Kohn and/or Teacher Effectiveness Training by Dr. Thomas Gordon -- then make up your own mind.$LABEL$0

Waste of time. Did not like this movie at all. I didnot finish watching it because it did not have the usual characters that we had grown accustomed to. The movie was boring and did not have any merit whatsoever. This was a total waste of movie time.$LABEL$0
The Red Shoes. For a movie that was done in 1950 it is wonderful. The story line seems a little trite. But the dancing is superb.$LABEL$1
Don't be fooled.. While it may be new, the device is junk. The frequency, amplitude and phase adjustments are not in "real time", that is, when you turn the knob, the digits do NOT follow you as you turn it. There is a significant time lag which makes it particularly difficult to zero in on a particular value. More over, the device is very light and cheaply made. I don't think that you could give it away to others once they see how it functions. That said, if you don't care about what value of frequency, amplitude or phase, or are only interested in very ball park values, this may work for you. The output signal does not seem to be bad as measured on an oscilloscope. It's the usability that is of concern.$LABEL$0
This Game REEKS. I borrowed this game to try it out. I had never played a Zelda game before and had heard that they were really good. But after I played it awhile, I found myself incredibly bored. I got extremely tired of sitting there waiting for the characters to stop talking already! And although Link (the main character) has a sword, he rarely uses it. Then he looses it later in the game and has to run around cluelessly trying to find it again. Talk about barely any action. After that he gets a talking boat and a goofy wand that, apparently, lets him controll the wind. What's with that? I don't call this a "puzzle" game. I call it a BORING game. I suggest you buy a Mario game, which cleverly combines puzzle with action.$LABEL$0
FANTASTIC TALES OF CHILDHOOD!!!@. WE LOVED THIS ONE! EVERYONE HAD, OR SHOULD HAVE HAD, A TEACHER LIKE MISS DAISY AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIFE. THIS BOOK REMINDED ME OF A COUPLE OF VERY SPECIAL TEACHERS FROM MY OWN PAST. DONALD DAVIS'S BOOKS REALLY TAKE YOU BACK. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!$LABEL$1
Great machine for the price!!!. I am a General Contractor and we do our own insulating, drywall and trim. I purchased the 50-760 more as a combination air cleaner(1micron bag)and dust colector that we could run continuously while we are working around it. It is a reletively quiet machine, dead silent compared to our large shopvac. It has plenty of power and with the castors it is a dream to move around the houses we work on. I purchased the 50 hose as well so that we could clean the air in smaller rooms without working around the machine and having to keep moving it. It has great suction and the two nozzles move a great deal of air. The only downside is the plastic collection bags are a little difficult to install the first time but it is very nice knowing how much is in them.$LABEL$1

Good TV....if it doesn't break.. I purchased this television in May, 2006, and it's performance was great while it lasted. After about 3 monhts, the tv began to malfunction. The colors would fade in and out, and then the picture would be rendered in about 4 colors, making everything on the screen a psychedelic blur. Eventually the screen would go out altogether, leaving me with a wonderful 32 inch flat-screen "radio". Westinghouse says they will take it back in for servicing, but it will cost me a fortune to ship it to them since I'm at an overseas military base. The bottom line is that this is a good tv, but it should have had a life span greater than three months.$LABEL$0
If only I were Spider-Man.... Wow! This movie is amazing! The special effects will blow your mind! Spider-Man blends utterly thrilling action with some light comedy, drama, and even a bit of romance! It's the ultimate movie-lover's movie. I really enjoyed it a lot, and what made it even more amazing was having Kirsten Dunst play the role of Mary-Jane, the object of Peter Parker's affection. A beautiful face, and excellent talent. Tobey Maguire is also a great young actor, full of spunk and after this movie, I'm sure he's going to be a "breakthrough" actor, totally mainstream. I can't wait for the next few installments in the Spider-Man series with Tobey and Kirsten. This is a great movie, take the family and some friends along and enjoy!$LABEL$1
Buy It !. Wow!! I read the reviews and people said it worked with the iPhone 4 - I was skeptical... Just bought a set at a store for $30 and came across this one on Amazon. Figured it was too good to be true... But for the price, I thought I couldn't go wrong. It WORKS!! I have an iPod Classic, Touch 3rd Generation, and the new 4th Generation iPod Touch and it works with all of them!!!!!!! What an amazing deal!! They are made cheap, but who cares - they work and look at the price!! Needless to say, the set I bought for $30 went back to the store!! I will be buying more of these for sure!$LABEL$1
Junk. Purchased, received, unpacked, turned on. That's where things started to go downhill. I slid the little light changing tab across and it snapped off, flew out of my hand and onto the floor where one of my cats thought it was the best little toy I had ever bought her. After wrestling the small piece of plastic away from the cat, I reattached it to the little metal piece that "held it" (obviously, I use that term loosely). The lights were stuck on part pink (daytime??) and part green (martian time?) and wouldn't budge. Packed it back up and shipped it back. Good times.$LABEL$0
Snitchin!. I hate to run my big mouth , but I have to tell you about Ex$pendable! This movie takes you right into the streets of Philly. And not to mention the violence and crime feels real.

Excellent A Cappella Singing for the Holidays. Primarily A Cappella is a label devoted - no surprise - to a cappella choral singing: vocal jazz, barbershop, national contest winners and local quartets alike. This CD is the label's first sampler designed to display the range of their offerings in holiday arrangements (their second, "A Voices Only Christmas," is very nearly as good as this one). The result is an eclectic, energetic, entertaining collection. There are excellent tracks from such vocal jazz dependables as the Swingle Singers, the Blenders (a smoooooth "First Noel), the Real Group, the Persuasions, the Nylons, and Rockapella (the bittersweet "Hold Out for Christmas"). Other standouts include the Haven Quartet's syncopated, ecstatic "Joy to the World," La Bande Magnetik's hilarious "Casse Noissettes," and especially the House Jack's thrilling "Saturnalia Smile," but the whole CD is a delight.$LABEL$1
Why do supervisors ecommend this book. I have heard Guyton described as a "fine work of English prose". I must say I disagree. I have found that it is difficult to use, that it fails to go into enough depth as a reference yet goes into too much depth as a revision work. The diagrams are poor, the pages flimsy (and in my edition in the wrong order!), and it is just far too heavy to carry around. The physiology focuses more on obscure subjects and hardly at all on the essentials. I have hardly used this in my first year as a medical student and am unlikely to start soon.$LABEL$0
A Great Beginning. I have always enjoyed the Star Wars universe, and The Phantom Menace is no exception. Awesome graphics! Familiar characters! And new ones to boot! The pod racing could inspire whole new videogames.I eagerly await the rest of the sequel, but I had to give this movie 4 stars because I want it on DVD, one of the best formats in existence today. I would love to see all of the Star Wars films on this medium. George Lucas, please show us DVD owners some support.$LABEL$1
Waste of Time and Money. This bottle warmer does not heat more than a 4 ounce bottle. I tried a 6 and an 8 ounce and it did not heat them at all-especially since we pre-make bottles for the day and store them in the refrigerator.The best way I've found is to use a glass measuring cup almost full of water in the microwave then place the bottle in it when it's done.Please don't waste your time or money on this...the baby need not wait for this thing not to work.

yeah yeah yeah.. hmmmm.. the name of the band says it all. should you listen to this band sometime? yeah. sometime NEVER. singer chris reynold's vocals are mediocre at best and the lyrics so ridden with cliches that one wonders why this band would want to make a permanent record of their work. seeing them open for low was one of those moments where you watch someone embarrass his/her self and you cringe because it's painful. do you stay for support? or do you you just walk away? most people did the latter. save your money. support your local band that opens for low because this one isnt' worth the bucks. there is no time for idle dreaming in my life and there certainly is no time for this generic blah blah blah disc.$LABEL$0
Cynical, sly and revisionist. This guy is really "stuck in the '60's", or rather what he thought the sixties were like when he was a naive youth. Many people tend to idealize their younger days, but to pass their fantasies off as history is a disgraceful act. It is also blatantly false and misleading. This author sounds and smells (at least intellectually if not actually) like some of the guys with grey, greasy ponytails that caused me to leave The Jersey Boys early in disgust last year. I lived through the sixties too, and it's time we all got over it.$LABEL$0

Great Game...... ....but the only real flaw is the camera. Already in stage 1 i was doing a double jump & the camera for some reason has a life of its own & decides to do a 360 camera turn so if i had moved the directional pad in anyway, id be at the bottom of the mountain & dead. I give this game a 4.5, nothing is ever perfect. But the developers did a good job of taking a legendary series & creating something everyone can enjoy as oppose to Spyro & Crash who unfortunately did nothing but failed since their oweners left. I brought this game along with Daxter & there both great original titles. But to be honest i enjoyed Ratchet more then i did Daxter. This game has alot of things 2 do for such a little machine. Its truly great. Enjoy =)$LABEL$1
Still Great!. I am 25 and learned to read using this book when I was 5. I purchased this to use for my 5 year old. It is a great book that teaches reading using phonics and sounding out the words rather that just learning to read by memorization, which is more important.$LABEL$1

Great Collection. Great collection spawning from Springsteen's early rock (Born to Run, Thunder Road, Badlands) to his cheesy pop hits (Dancing in the Dark, Hungry Heart), his story ballads (The River, Atlantic City), rock anthems (Born in the U.S.A., Glory Days), and his newer rock hits (Human Touch, Better Days). At the end he throws in soundtrack hit "Streets of Philadephia" and some new tracks.Overall the collection is excellent; it shines from the "Born to Run" album through "Born in the U.S.A" album and then the song quality drops a little for the rest of the album. But every songwriter has a "golden period" and sooner or later will decline. Still, even on later tracks such as "Murder Incorporated" and "This Hard Land," his ferocious singing and deep lyrics are impressive. My one qualm is not including the haunting ballad "I'm on Fire."$LABEL$1
Stop trying to impress with your mystery knowledge. If the author would stick to writing mysteries, her books could be among the best in the genre. However she spends way too much time describing people's actions and motives by comparing them to another author's characters. Noone thinks or does anything on Broward's Rock without Annie commenting to herself that the thought or action was just like this or that fictional mystery character. While I enjoy the bit with the contest that has the characters guessing their fictional origin, this constant "showing off" of the author's mystery fiction knowledge detracts from the story. Any true mystery buff probably knows as much but hopefully doesn't spend their time sizing up their friends and family by this criteria.Stick to the mystery writing and leave the mystery trivia to game players.$LABEL$0
Product Not What Was Advertised. The product description said the case was to have had: "a removable flip cover, which safeguards the iPod click wheel when closed but offers full access to the controls and ports when open" and a "reinforced money-clip-style belt clip". The product description also states that it "Features a scratch and dust resistant screen for maximum protection."--the case had none of these features. The case, itself, is okay, yet way overpriced for what you don't get. Quite a disappointment!$LABEL$0

Worth the money. I bought the Williams Sonoma brand with the aluminum insert as a Christmas present for myself. I already own 3 slow cookers, one 4qt, one 5qt, and one 6qt, all of them different brands. I never noticed that all 3 of them on low setting is not a true low setting until I used my new All Clad. I now know what everyone else was talking about. I made lentil soup and turkey stock both on low setting for 6-8 hours and my turkey stock came out clearer because it was on a true low setting. And my lentils were not mush, they held their shape. I prefer the 7qt size because I can freeze half of what is made. Even after we eat the other half, there is still enough for lunch the next day. I will be making my meat sauce for pasta tomorrow and knowing the low setting works correctly, I am sure it will turn out delicious. I also like that the lid is stainless steel, because if I drop it, it will not break. Also, I can put the lid and insert in the dishwasher and it comes out beautiful.$LABEL$1
It's O.K. But I Miss Power PC. It's a good purchase, good construction, good look, but is not as stable as the Power PC ones, I think It might be something about the Intel thing...

An excellent paperweight. I am a graduate student in mathematics so I've been through my share of textbooks. To this day, I have not found one quite as inconsistent as this one. Some sections are flawless; the author is elegant in his explanation, the examples are clear and relevant, and the problems serve their purpose. However, the poorly written sections (and trust me, there are plenty of them) far outweigh what little beauty lies in this textbook. Anyone who wishes to meticulously plow through this book will know what I'm talking about. The most depressing thing about it all is that I can't seem to find a book (on DE's) that's any better! So to you mathematicians out there: write a decent book on Differential Equations; you might become a millionaire. However, as mentioned earlier, this book will weigh down anything, even in the strong winds of Lubbock.$LABEL$0
Not 18/10. I wasn't paying attention when I ordered this pot. My bad for not paying attention. It is not 18/10 stainless steel. No where on the box does it say 18/10.

Better Than Tap Water. We had quite a "fancy" water purifier for many years and since we couldn't decide what to purchase to replace it, we ordered a Brita for the transition. It's been a good purchase since it makes the water taste good, but it seems the filter goes out way before the two month suggested change. It begins to taste "off" after about 5-6 weeks. There's two of us using it, me and my husband, and we do like to drink water ... but I would think it should last longer.It's easy to clean and easy to fill. Nice design for its purpose.$LABEL$1
Good Idea....Poor Product.. I bought this after I read the first review below (the one who gave this 5 stars). It just doesn't work very well...I do a better job pumicing on my own (it just takes more effort). The motor does get extremely hot, and the batteries die very quickly. The box says it can run for 45 minutes on two AA's, but after about 5 minutes...you can feel it slow down.Definitely not worth it. I'm calling today to return it.$LABEL$0
Nice book to have on the shelf. I enjoyed the read of this book. It gave me a few new ideas. I often think I am an outcast at AA meetings when I have also have another mental diagnosis. But now I do not feel the same way.$LABEL$1
Super easy to assemble. I bought this cabinet to use as food storage because I live in an efficiency apt with no cabinets in the kitchenette. Although it was a little heavy to move upstairs to my apartment on my own, I was able to do it by tilting it on its side and sliding it up the stairs by pushing it from behind, so it can be done without help if necessary. And, as the other reviews stated it is very easy to assemble; The directions are simple, I had no problems doing it alone, and it took no time at all (less than an hour(?) - could easily be done in 30 minutes the next time, I think, especially with help). It really does fit together just like giant legos - no tools required! I really wish it was offered in black; the putty color really doesn't fit in well with the rest of the things in my apartment, but I can live with it for now. I've been thinking about buying some large removable peel-and-stick stickers to spruce it up a bit.$LABEL$1
Time piece. This was an enduring adventure that over the years it covers brings the veiwer an up close and personal experience of that period, I loved the acting and cinema-scape.

All the same I'm glad to of made the purchase.$LABEL$1
Feels like thin felt, soft but thin enough to see thru. I ordered these sheets for our guest room, having family over for Christmas and it's cold outside. I was expecting "Fleece" which is the exact word used to describe these sheets in the seller's description - however, these sheets are more like thin, see thru felt used for art projects. The back side of the top sheet has a nylon back, so it's not even the same material on both sides the top is a felt like material and the back side is stretchy nylon material. Hopefully they will be okay for the 5 days we have guests, but definitely NOT for long time wear.$LABEL$0
fact of fiction?. I realize Mr. Marion says this book is a mixture of fact and fiction, but the amalgamation of both coupled with this writing style, essentially render the whole effort fiction and comic-book fantasy reading. As such, if you read it for entertainment purposes only, it has engaging sections. Yet many sections completely bore you or make you feel Mr. Marin is simply boasting about his supposed prowess and intellectual escapades (not to mention his sexual escapades). In short, after the roller-coaster ride through Tokyo's Chuo-Ku, it leaves you somewhat cheapened, like a one night stand by the author and Wall-Street's biggest. I suppose that was the intent based on the title, but you never realize how bad that can be till the "morning after."$LABEL$0
Miles Davis quietly guides listeners through "Forrester". Gus Van Sant, the filmmaker responsible for "Finding Forrester," chose Jazz pioneer Miles Davis to guide us through this complex drama. Van Sant, who used Elliot Smith's lonesome ballads to pull heart strings in "Good Will Hunting," uses some of Miles Davis' most solitary and contemplative music to accopmany his film on writting. In fact the last track on the album "In A Silent Way" musically parallels the act of writting and thinking. The song is complex but gentle and features Miles at his creative, post-fusion best. "In A Silent Way," and all the tracks on this album (some by Bill Frissel) are like well behaved children, evoking all the complexities and beauty of life yet demanding no atttention or energy. perfect music to accompany the solitary act of writting or just a quiet day.$LABEL$1
The Great Napoleon. I hail Napoleon Bonaparte as having been a truly recgonized conqueror of modern times. A&E'e Biographly did help to clear- up some points, that I had failed to fully understand during my reading about him. I was hoping to learn more about his General's i.e was it true about their betrayal of him? All in all, I think it was a well produce portrait, of one of the three greatest men in all the history of this world.bevil$LABEL$1
Another Sopranos ripoff. Charles Stella writes like another goombah wannabe. His storyline was amatuerish and the prose was child like. The only thing positive about this book is it reaffirms the theory that if a hundred monkeys banged on a typewriter for 10 years that they would eventually recreate a Shakesperean play. Now that I think about it Stella actually disproves that theory.$LABEL$0
Very Poorly Organized. This is one of the most poorly laid out language books I have studied from. First of all, I would like to state that languages are not my forte and I am not a natural at linguistics. Vietnamese is the fifth language I have studied and this book has made it most frustrating. The vocabulary is scattered all over each chapter rather than concisely at the beginning or end like better organized books. The glossary often does not have words the reader is looking for when they have forgotten them chapters later. There are also a few typographical errors in the answer key which further confuse the student.Also, table of contents only lists the titles of the chapters and does not list subtopics or chapter objectives. So if the student wants to reference a certain language point, he/she has to remember which chapter it was from then comb the chapter to find it.$LABEL$0
Great Sound for not so much money. I've own them for 5 years now, they still sound excellent, very good for listening music at home, but not very recomendable for going out with them (must handle with care). They will improve A LOT the sound out of your mp3 player, cd player and you can enjoy the full potential of a nice home stereo system.My ears do tend to hurt a bit after 2 hours with them, but that's enought time for me. Bass is incredible for the size they have, mid's are perfectly clear and hi tones are crispy, well defined and not ear piercing. Give them a try, you wont regret it. By the way, please excuse my english, I'm not a native speaker.$LABEL$1

Nothing new here.. I had great hopes for this graphic novel. Generally each film or book brings something new to the genre even if they aren't of the highest quality. This dull piece of work actually managed to bring yawns to the table. The so so artwork is only topped by the ho hum story. My advice is avoid, go online and read some of the many amateur zombie works that far out class this stinker.$LABEL$0
Dungeons and Dragons 2. I also saw the Screener today and thought it was far superior in everyway than the first, well apart from the special effects but they were still believeable. This is how the first movie should have been, The script, the acting and the atmosphere, in fact everything about this film is better than the first. Great interaction between the Rogue and Barbarian. Damidar is actually believeable in this film, Great references to actually DnD and we get to see alot of magic not just the magic dust from the first movie. Very big improvement on the first and alot more serious (no more snails, GREAT) i definately reccommend it. Rumours of a third movie already and all i can say is hope its like the 2nd not the 1st.$LABEL$1
stated 5 yr warranty is a hoax. The packaging states that the product is covered by a 5 year warranty and that, if the product fails due to a defect in material or workmanship, the product can be returned to Swing-A-Way for repair or replacement.After 5 months of use, a large piece of the plastic teeth inside the crusher broke off. I called the manufacturer (Focus Foodservice, LLC, who purchased Swing-A-Way) and was told that they now only deal with distributors and that I would have to return the product to the original seller (i.e., Amazon.com) to obtain a refund or replacement.$LABEL$0
Workouts were just okay, but style is a dud. This is one of the worst put together exercise videos that I have ever seen. For starters, everyone else failed to mention that the camera moves while Michelle is moving. This makes you really dizzy just watching.Second, there is hardly any explanation given. Even if you're like me and watch it once beforehand to see what the workout is like, it's really hard to follow.Third, everything felt too rushed. In the pilates segment, for a brief moment you can see one of the cameramen holding up fingers to show Michelle how many repetitions were left. I guess we all know what she's interested in: hurrying up to go somewhere else.A much better 10 minute mix-and-match workout series is the QuickFix series.$LABEL$0
Not bad for the price. Looks neat , works fine.Sometimes it is off a little bit if used in quick succession but on the whole a satisfactory purchase.$LABEL$1
Wouldn't suggest it. Works good but leaks constantly. Followed the directions on how to stop the leak from the sprayer, didn't do any good, still leaked. The motion detector works great and the spray goes a long way, it's just the constant leak that is the problem. Can't use it because the leak causes a HUGE puddle and our water bill jumped up very noticeably. Nope, wouldn't recommend this product.$LABEL$0
GREAT QUALITY!!. PROS: GREAT SIZE! LOOKS LIKE THE ACTUAL SIZE OF A REAL BASKETBALL, FOOTBALL, ETC. ALSO MADE OF AMAZING QUALITY. BALLS ARE STILL IN IT'S MESS BAG AND EVERYTHING IS STILL HOLDING UP PERFECTLY FINE (PURCHASED ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO). JUST GETTING AROUND TO DOING A REVIEW LOLCONS: NOT SAYING THAT THESE ARE BAD THINGS, BUT IT'S JUST NOT WHAT I EXPECTED WITH I PURCHASED THEM. IT'S ADVERTISED AS PLUSH, WHICH I'M ASSUMING TO BE SOFT AND PLUSH LIKE A PILLOW. THAT'S MY REASON OF PURCHASING TO USE AS A PILLOW/BED BUDDY FOR MY SON. BUT THEY WERE EXTREMELY HARD!! THE OUTSIDE IS VERY SOFT, BUT WITH SO MUCH STUFFING IT MAKES THE BALLS VERY HARD/HEAVY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN TO CARRY OR EVEN THROW AND DEFINITELY NOT SLEEP ON. A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED, BUT I SHOULD HAVE ASKED QUESTIONS BEFORE PURCHASING.$LABEL$1
A readers choice. I read Gangsta, and i figured this book would be much better. I'm just glad I didn't have to buy Road Dawgz... thanks to my sister.$LABEL$0
There is always 2 sides to a story. I adored this book! I couldn't put it down. I chose it because I heard the musical was up for a Tony or two and I was looking for a new book to read. Since this book was referring to The Wizard of Oz and someone made a musical out of it I was expecting a light-hearted story with humor scattered about like peanut shells at a steak house. But it is not. I was pleasantly surprised by it's deep story...love, betrayal, jealously, friendship, racism, politics and sex...oh-la-la! It could be a soap opera. I loved it! I couldn't help but imagine the characters as they look in Fleming's movie, especially towards the ill fated end. It is a strange feeling changing your allegiance from one team to another...i.e. Glinda is now bad to me, Dorothy a pawn and don't get me started on the Wizard! :) I just bought Son of a Witch yesterday and can't wait to see what happens in the land of Oz!$LABEL$1
Hard book to read. I had to read this to help my son and this was one of the worst and hardest books to read. I didn't see the educational value in assigning this book when it was a very hard book to retain. I would not recommend this book.$LABEL$0

omg & wtf!. i bought this dvd set at a huge discount. i remember the series was out years ago and never followed it. and i got to say, what a mess. although based on a graphic novel, or comic, it seems like oliver stone's answer to Twin Peaks that finished up earlier. stone was clearly trying to imitate Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet and bombed in so doing. i'm amazed at how many positive reviews this has. none of the actors were strong, the music was over dramatic, using everything from Bethoven's 7th to the Animals and Rolling Stones. angie dickinson as a thug? come on! it was embarrassing to watch her: gouge someone's eyes out, bitch slap and gut punch another. cattrell was equally miscaste and her dramatic cry of "it's my baby!" was laughable. in trying to be bizarre, it failed miserably. there isn't any level that i would recommend this series. buy it used if you must waste your money.$LABEL$0
Do not buy this book. 1) This book is outdated. 310-25 is an old exam. You are better off passing the new one - 310-035.2) The book contains some serious errors. For example, here is an excerpt from the page 146:"Polymorphism ... in object oriented programming, refers to the capability of objects to have many methods of the same name, but different types of arguments. The print() and println() methods of the PrintStream class are excellent examples of polymorphism".This definition of polymorphism is just plain WRONG.3) I cannot say anything about the second part related to the 310-027 exam.4) A good book to buy to prepare for the 310-035 exam:Sun Certified Programmer & Developer for Java 2 Study Guide (Exams 310-035 & 310-027) by Kathy Sierra (she is a co-developer of the SCJP 1.4 exam 310-035) and Bert Bates.$LABEL$0
My son LOVES this movie. My son (and me and my husband) thought this movie was so funny! Especially if you have cats and understand them. It really plays on the way cats act compared to dogs. Its really hilarious in parts. A good clean fun movie for the whole family.$LABEL$1
Junk. I used these for about a month and ended up never pulling them out of the drawer again. Stickyest non-stick item I have ever used. Even when sprayed with Pam the eggs stick. If the eggs are well scrambled they leak out from under the ring. The one thing correct in the description is that they are easy to take apart. So easy that if you try to use the handle to pick up all four at once it falls apart and drops them all.$LABEL$0
Still hilarious after all these years. The DVD of Mr. Hulot's Holiday will have you chortling, snickering and flat-out laughing all by yourself. Although it is in French, with English subtitles, no knowledge of French is necessary because humor transcends language. Mr. Hulot is quite oblivious to the quirky situations he creates at the seaside resort hotel where he is spending his holiday, always maintaining his cheery spirit in the face of the catastrophes of others.It's a must-have for anyone who appreciates the art of sight gags and old-time silent movie humor.$LABEL$1
Very Poor Directions. Although there is a good variety of trails in this book, I got lost every time I used it. The directions were not unclear- they were completely wrong. The book was written in 1995 so maybe some of the roads have changed, but there has to be a more reliable book out there. I would not recommend this book to anyone.$LABEL$0
The End of Patience: Binary Fallout. I enjoyed The End of Patience very much. I had to laugh at how many of David Shenk's insights I could relate to, although I had never slowed down enough to consider them. I highly recommend this book. If you've never considered the effect of the constant barrage of digital information The End of Patience will be an eye opener.$LABEL$1

An insult to Morrison and his fans. Stephen Davis seems to have done his research in gossipy internet chat rooms and other places where old rumors are kicked around for years, the more scandalous the better. Davis has simply taken a lot of really old stories from previously published sources, thrown in a couple of interviews with people no one's ever heard of before, and is presenting it as new revelation. It's not. This is just the same old silly stories packaged up between fancy new covers. Fans won't learn anything about the real Morrison or what really happened to him. All they'll get is a lot of reheated gossip that wasn't worth the paper it was written on the first time it was published -- or the second, or the third, or the... Fans who really want to know Morrison should read his poetry, or read Frank Lisciandro's "Feast of Friends" or Patricia Butler's "Angels Dance and Angels Die" for a look at the real Jim Morrison.$LABEL$0
Where are the Sheik's?. Guests of the Sheik : An Ethnography of an Iraqi Village by Elizabeth Fernea is a very old book, published first in 1965 and then 1969. A lot of major things have taken place in Iraq since then including the Gulf War and in its aftermath the strangling sanctions, so I find that the book although it has a catchy title does little to reflect what life in an Iraqi village is like or has been in the last decade. Although in Islam Polygamy is permitted with certain restrictions to label the whole of Iraq or even a whole village as a "polygamous society" is a stretch of the imagination. The books print is poor which doesn't help it's readability.$LABEL$0

Maybe I Was Grumpy That Day. ...but it seemed to me that this is a book that someone *made* Pratchett write. It's missing his usual joie d'ecrire and can most charitably be described as 'dutifully composed'. There are, thank God, many superb Discworld books, but if this had been the first of them I'm not sure there would have been a second.$LABEL$0
Journey - 'Trial By Fire' (Sony). Apparently,their last work with frontman Steve Perry and quite the let down.'Trial...' was the band's '96 comeback attempt,but if I remember correctly this CD was a stiff from the get-go.I tried SO hard to get into this fifteen track disc,but even with a duration of 68 minutes,I just couldn't.The songs don't completely suck,they just don't appear to have much life.Fantastic cover,don't you agree?If you're an old school Journey fan,I encourage you to check out their new 2005 release,'Generations' with vocalist Steve Augeri,who's been with the band for awhile now.That CD is surprisingly good,as I'd give it 3 1/2,maybe 4 stars.Keep in mind that guitarist Neal Schon is their 'key' player.$LABEL$0
Excellent Book About a Serious Topic. This book should be read by every American in order to understand the political scene and its hidden agendas currently operating.$LABEL$1
half great. I was never a fan of the New Kids but I love Jordan's voice and half-love his neo-soul CD. The Jimmy Jam-Terry Lewis cuts really outshine the other stuff, although Finally Finding Out and the Thom Bellish When You're Lonely are very good. Next time, Jordan, hire Jam and Lewis to steer the entire enterprise. You make a great team. They get many more interesting shades out of your already interesting voice. P.S. Best single of the year so far: Give It To Me. Broken by You and Close My Eyes are outstanding ballads, despite what the main Amazon.com review says. Close My Eyes should be your next video.$LABEL$1
This novel gets a Raspberry from me. Disappointing, disappointing, and what do you know, disappointing! That just about sums up my feelings towards this book after doggedly ploughing through the entire thing. Obviously, literary talent isn't hereditary in the Rice family. I havn't read crime thrillers since many moons ago, so when I decided to pick one up again and decided on Snow Garden, I thought I was in for a night of exciting action. I was proven wrong. By the time I had gotten through a quarter of the book, I knew it was a lost cause. Granted, one shouldn't be expecting beautiful lyrical prose in thrillers and in-depth character delineation, but surely one shouldn't be served with truckloads of surfacial details (e.g. about art), attempts at creating multitudious oh-so-quirky homosexual relationships and a plot that sinks to abysmal depths!! Seriously, if Chris Rice has any writing ability at all, I hope he shows it soon. This novel is a very disappointing showcase of his talent (if any).$LABEL$0
Caught on fire !!. Bought this Coffeemaker last year from a local store. It worked fine until yesterday and then it caught on fire !!! I know it wasn't the electrical socket and it wasn't a power surge - It must have been something in the coffeemaker electric system. Fortunately I was able to put out the fire before it set the cabinets on fire. I can live with an occasional water spill as other reviews have mentioned but not with a fire !! I will never buy a Mr. Coffee product again. Oh and of course the warranty is 2 months over the 1 year mfg. warranty ( not that I would want a replacement).$LABEL$0
UNFORGETTABLE, LIFE-CHANGING FILM!. This movie should be seen by everyone. I had never even heard of it and just happened to stumble upon it at BLOCKBUSTERS because a friend had given me a free movie card and I had some time to kill.The young actor who played the lead should have WON an Academy Award. The film should be, in my books, equally as respected, lauded and appreciated as SCHINDLER'S LIST, SOPHIE'S CHOICE, or ANY other film about the horrors of the German concentration camps of World War II.I believe so strongly in this film thay I'm buying it for my home DVD library and will encourage everyone I know to see it. It's one of those movies that make you mindful of the complex spectrum of the human heart. It can be cold and evil and yet, it can also be triumphantly transcendent.Please see FATELESS. Please let it restore your faith in the powerful potential of films.$LABEL$1
The hits just keep on coming. Once again I am amazed and awe inspired by Robert Jordan's fantastic novels. While the books themselves are long (nearly 1000 pages) I just can't get enough. I have read all of the books that are currently out and cannot wait for the next one. The world spun by Jordan is rich and realistic. And there are strong female roles as well as the typical male roles. Truely a must read series.Tricia Shaffe$LABEL$1
Bad Reception. All I can say is don't buy these phones. The reception is not good at all. We have the base unit set up in the bedroom. If I go more than 40 feet away I start to get noise, static, or whatever you want to call it when talking to someone. We've had a 900 MHz cordless phone with the base unit set up in the same place and the reception was always good. Also if your talking on one of the phones, someone else cannot pickup the other phone and join in on the conversation. I returned these phones 1 day after I bought them.$LABEL$0
Horrible for more than one-time use.... I purchased a four pack of these razors because I prefer a razor with a wider handle and multiple blades. Despite the wide handle, the razors slipped from my hand easily. The multiple blades also didn't help- they did not shave the hair that closely, but close enough to cut the skin and give razor burn. On the first use, they were decent, but throughout shaving, I had to constantly tap the razor head on the side of the shower to remove the hair that was stuck in there. Even then, there was still quite a bit of hair stuck in there as well as shaving cream, so any subsequent use of the razor would be pointless. Also, the head of the razor does not turn very well to follow the skin. Save your money and buy a different brand.$LABEL$0
Rotten product. First off, it seems that someone is spamming the reviews. Each of these glowing reviewers has never reviewed anything else on Amazon. And when a bad review is posted you'll see several days worth of great reviews to push off the bad ones. [edit: Note the new "Amazon verified purchase" label! Beware of the glowing review from people who have not purchased this item.]Let me say, this is the biggest pile of junk you'll ever waste you're money on. Even with high quality clumping litter it did not work. The rake would get clogged. The receptacle wouldn't close. Litter stuck all over the place and in the tracks even though we were well below the "fill line." We spent more time cleaning this piece of junk than a regular litter box. In less than a month we threw it out in the garbage.Do not waste your time and money on this product. Stick with the regular litter, you'll be glad you did.$LABEL$0
Boring and very dull. Despite what other people said about this book I am very disappointed. You don't have to travel anywhere to find peace within yourself. Lock up yourself in your room, meditate and you will be able to listen to your heart and find peace. I found this book very dull, boring and shallow. Will not recommend this book to avid reader.Good thing, I did not buy this book, my friend lent it to me , otherwise I will have a hard time to hide this book. Don't waste your time. Read something else.$LABEL$0
Disappointing. Baby Newton is nothing like the original series (i.e., Baby Bach, Baby Mozart, etc.) ... My 21-month absolutely loves the Baby Einstein series. We bought her the Baby Newton, and she could care less. She doesn't giggle, she doesn't dance and she doesn't sing to this one. In fact, she'll pop it out of the VHS and grab a different tape! I'm very disappointed with this one.$LABEL$0
My College Thesis. This is very slow read. And why? Because interspersed into the verbiage are so many references to other works it just slows the reader down. It is also very redundant. Retool this book and have a bibliography at the end for at least half of the references crammed into the text. Also keep in mind that a lot of the information is data not past (around) the year 2000. A lot has changed in the last decade and this book should be updated (and cleaned up as I mentioned above). All of which is too bad, because the relevant material, when you can parse it out of all of the academic babble, is interesting.$LABEL$0

Music Redefined. After hearing the debut album from Dom Dorman and the Icemen, it seems that there is something new and fresh on the horizon. I'm not sure I have heard something like this in quite a long time. I am fan of Dave Matthews and Blues Traveler and I truly believe that this album will attract the same fans. The sound is unique, in an interesting way blending jazz and classic rock. Dom Dorman is also quite versatile - playing both the quick and riveting Last November as well as the ballad-esque Southern Spain. I truly believe that this band has a future and I would recommend the album to anyone.$LABEL$1
The Missing Link. "Other Side of Love" was never released on either of Yazoo's albums. It was released as a single between the two albums.

HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT !. How this Mustard ever Won two "Best Mustard" Titles is a Wonder. It is advertized under Two different Name Titles,so do not be Fooled by the Titles, they are Both the exact same Mustard. After trying this Mustard I can see why people mix it with other Ingredients, i.e., Mayo, Honey, Sour Cream, etc. Used Straight, it starts off Good, but Then a Slightly BITTER Taste Kicks in which totaly ruins the Mustard Taste. In my Opinion it is a Huge Disappointment !.$LABEL$0
Simply quaint. Luckily, nothing momentous happened when the year 2000 came to be, and we can now crawl out from under rocks and out of bomb shelters and openly laugh at our now silly-seeming fears. Or maybe it's just James Garner. Aside from a few interesting gags and factoids, the humour of this Y2K spoof is muddled and repetitive. The chapters cover literally everything from divination to prophecy to Y2K preparations (not to mention the significance of the year MM to McDonalds Corporation), but I couldn't bring myself to anything bigger than a quaint smile.This book is not for the devout believers. Do notice than in Garner's dictionary, the words "eschatological" and "scathological" are separated only by a single syllable.$LABEL$0
unreliable and hard to use - thumb down. Do not buy. It crashed several times on a plain Dell 8600. Very hard to use, like for example to set up rooms, because (1) there are no anchor points; should be able to anchor a corner and then drag a corner; (2) we cannot lock a room in place; while editing a room, another room resized; (3) there is no alignment among rooms; rooms should align sometimes, because they may share a common wall; (4) while working with a room, we cannot specify the type of wall; and so on. It has some sexy colors and menus, but after trying to use it for several times and coming out with no results, the next step is 'uninstall'.$LABEL$0

What one would expect of Princeton Review. Oversimplified once again, and with some serious errors, especially on one question on comparative advantage where they've reversed the numerator and denominator of a fraction. My friends who were unfortunate enough to buy this as their review for AP Econ found themselves completely confused and having wasted so much time on mistakes in the book. The review wasn't particularly comprehensive or in-depth, there were blatant errors (mentioned in other reivews), and the tests again were easy compared to the AP exam...never a good thing for test prep books.$LABEL$0
a story from home. this book touched me in a way that it will not touch others. i went to andover with courtney, in fact she was my brothers date for prom. so as i read this book pictures of courtney ran through my mind. so nights after reading this book i could not fall asleep because of what i had read, and others i did not want to because i wanted to read more. what a great book i hope that more people will read it and find out just how fragile life really is.$LABEL$1
HAHAHA. And I'm still laughing. This movie is really horrible. Is it supposed to be horror or soft core porn? I'm not sure which but either way it has the plot for both. I bought this movie years ago and decided to watch it tonight because I really have no life. The only thing good about this movie is Buckethead's music and that is the only reason I bought it in the 1st place.If you like cheesy horror with nakie girls and awesome music then you might like this.$LABEL$0

My favorite skillet. I use this more than any other pan in my cabinet. It's easy to clean, it stays in good condition, and it's big enough for most everything I need to cook. I cook eggs, sear meat, cook burgers, etc., in this. My sister bought this as a gift for me a few years ago. She got it at Macy's and I think she paid $60 or more for it. I love this pan, but I think it is more reasonably priced here on amazon for around $30+. Macy's overpriced it. But I'm getting good use out of this skillet. I am thinking of buying another one. If I do, it'll be from Amazon, as long as they're still selling it. I highly recommend this for your everyday use. I also like the side handles as opposed to the regular one handle.$LABEL$1
Breaks right out of the box. Opened it up and tried it. The plastic rod connected to the brush broke in less than 60 seconds trying to use it to clean the dryer vent. The rod does not have a metal core....just plastic, so when it is bending in the dryer vent....it broke, leaving the brush head inside the vent. Had to remove the entire vent and fish the head out. Would not recomend this product at all.$LABEL$0

Perfect guidebook for a memorable culinary journal. Joan Peterson, the culinary mistress of the EAT SMART series, returns to feed our continuing love affair with foreign foods and flavors in her latest book, Eat Smart in Morocco. As much a travel guide as it is a cookbook, Peterson shares her knowledge of the history and cultural significance of native dishes as well as the traditions and secrets of Moroccan cooks. Her culinary tribute to the land and its people should be part of an official welcome packet given to every foreign visitor when they first step on Moroccan soil. As she writes, "What better way to know a culture than through its cuisine." Particularly helpful to travelers are her bilingual menu, and food and flavor guides. Whether you're a novice or experienced traveler, Eat Smart in Morocco is the perfect reference for a memorable culinary journey. --Kimberly Ouhirra, President, Exotica Oils, Inc.$LABEL$1

Troublesome Monitor. This may be the worst electronic gadget we've ever owned. The biggest problem is with the sound quality of the monitor itself. On one channel we get major static, on the other channel we get a high-pitched background whine with occasional tapping sounds which come through loud and clear. It sounds like someone clapping and it's very disconcerting to hear that coming from the baby's room in the middle of the night. We can't hear the baby unless we're so close we don't need the monitor. We're also having the same trouble other reviewers have had with the "light show" coming on spontaneously. On the whole, we're not happy with this product.$LABEL$0
Not bad!!!. I've been playing the Madden NFL series for a long time and the 2002 version is significantly better than the 2001 version. The improved graphics and gameplay (A.I is smarter now) makes it fun and challenging. The scoreboards in the stadium now reflect actually time left in quarter, the actual score and other stats of the down.What was disappointing was the fact that they used very much the same sound bites from the 2001 version so the color commentary is boring to someone who has played previous versions. Sometimes the color commentary makes no sense whatsover.Overall, a good upgrade but beware of the system requirements. You need RAM and a good graphics card loaded with RAM as well.$LABEL$1
holy mother of god!!. This is the biggest crock of crap i have ever heard. Everyone should acknowledge. what michael moore does. yes he is a radical liberal, a man from the left. But everyone who wrote a review is not going after michael moore they are going after the left. When will we work past the differences and stop pointing fingers. To boot, one of the critics on this book also rated on an ironing press. see there you go im playing your stupid f**cked game of slander now, where instead of working to make things better or god forbid say something positive about anything, besides conservatives loveing america, instead blaming our problems on moores weight. It baffles me to this day just how ignorant people are. your presented with the facts with no rebutle from the bush organization, and you say "thats not true". excuse me i have to go throw up$LABEL$0
Nice fit.. My son needs shoe cushions as he is between a size 15 & 16 and half sizes are not common in sizes over 13. Thye hold up really great and do not make his feet smell.

Weak product. I bought this because my wife has R.A. and she has problems with hand strength.

So we will use this until the bolts fall out.$LABEL$0
Don't waste your money!. I should have known better to buy any product with only 5 reviews, but I decided to buy this anyway. It sounded like a great book from the description and reviews. I was a littled concerned that I couldn't preview the book at all but I figured it was because it was a cookbook. This book was awful! Be prepared to eat white rice 1-2 times a week! I have already returned the book but if i remember correctly, one of the recipes was chicken baked with Catalina dressing on it. I was seriously dissapointed. Every week you ate white rice and some kind of chicken "burger". The book talks to like you have no intelligence at all and like you have never made a grocery list in your life. This book is a waste of money and if I could give it 0 stars, I would. This is a book for somebody who has never cooked a day in their life. Don't buy!$LABEL$0
Extremely disappointing. I found this story to be too confused and busy. It meanders between characters until it brings them all together later on in the book, but it just seems like the brief moments of actual "action" are just huge build-ups of anticipation with an anti-climatic little *pop* of dénouement. In short, nothing's happening to keep me interested! The characters are fantastic, the author's descriptive powers are beyond compare, but there's just no story there.I tend to like a good vampire fic to keep me shivering for a night or two. This one has kept me groaning night after night trying to finish it for almost three weeks (an exhaustively long time for me to finish a book). Ghost, Steve, Nothing, Christian, and Brite's version of the Stygian triplets are all rich, wonderful characters. Now if only she'd done something with them....Disappointing, especially after all the good I'd heard about this author.$LABEL$0
Mom's Best Friend. I received this steamer for Christmas last year. My son was 6 months old at the time. I started steaming food for him that I could make into baby food. Now I use the steamer 2-3 times per week for the whole family. It is so easy to throw vegetables in one side and potatoes in the other and start the timer. I don't have to wait for water to boil or over cook things while I chase my toddler. I only saw one other steamer that cooks two items side by side and it did not compare to this steamer.I have never used another steamer and this one is pricey, but the corn on the cob, broccoli, and lobster made in this steamer is the best I have ever tasted!$LABEL$1

Downy Soft and Odorless. I was one happy person when Downy finally came out with an unscented version. Some people like their clothes to smell like aromatherapy, but it's too much for my nose to handle. This product gives my laundry Downy softness, but it smells clean, not floral. Nice to have it delivered right to my door and the price was great thanks to a special offer on P&G products.$LABEL$1

Completely Disappointed!. Being a fan of the "Old" 569 Straight leg Loose jeans I took a shot at ordering this new style. I had read some of the negative reviews but took a chance on them anyhow. Now after receiving them I wish I hand't wasted my time with these and I'm still left wondering what the hell Levi's is thinking. Thin material, shallow pockets, tight fitting, and just all around uncomfortable. I hope to find another style that fits like the Old 569's.$LABEL$0
A Dance Classic. American Sharon Redd was the diva of choice for serious UK clubbers in the early 80s. Redd, at one time a member of Bette Midler's "Harlettes", managed to obtain British chart success long before Midler did. This album, one of three she recorded for the Prelude label, contains the majority of her UK hit singles. The production on this album is stunning as is Redd's deep, rich voice. The biggest hit, "Never Give You Up" is a dancefloor monster, a once heard/never forgotten experience. Redd was equally adept at ballads, as "Takin' A Chance On Love" will demonstrate. Sadly, Redd died in 1992, and yet again, a great voice was silenced. This CD is a must for those into great dance music, and great voices.$LABEL$1
Useful information with research-based foundation. This is the first book that I have read that provides me with the information to confront the problems associated with instilling intrinsic motivation in those that I manage. It is often the problem that people show little concern for their work. The rule seems to be something like this- Do just enough to get by while exerting the least energy as possible. I like this book because the information is not a story of what a good manager has as an opinion as to what works best but it is a scholarly book in the sense that it provides information based on research that is proven. This is to date the best book that I have to reference when dealing with teams that act out of extrinsic motivation or no motivation at all. I applaud the author for this work.$LABEL$1
SWEET!!!. Heat up a coffee cup with about 3 oz of milk and if you have a sweet tooth put some sugar with it then go to town with this thing. Just put it in the heated milk and turn it on, make sure you give it a little time to thicken up the milk before you start pulling it up. Make sure to read the review about making froth animals. Best review ever! Take a look at all the pictures, this really does what it claims.$LABEL$1
Not bad at all. The phone is actually pretty good for the price. (At first I was a little skeptical.) Everyone knows that there are pros and cons for just about anything. Some of the cons for the phone would be the static (which is minor if the phone is charged), and the fact that it is incompatible with Caller ID. (but who needs the extra expense anyway?). The pros would be the different ringers, the fun color, the fact that you can use headphones, the any-key answer, the pre-set speed dials, and the pager. (I really like the pager because it beeps until you find it-or at least for a couple of minutes- when most phones usually stop after a few beeps). I have even taken this phone into the backyard without extra static. So, if you are looking for a decent phone for a good price then this one's for you (works especially good for a teenage or college student)$LABEL$1
Outstanding!!!!!!!. This was an AMAZING book! I literally could not put it down. By far the best book I have ever read, including the others in the series. Surprises around every corner!

Outdated and of Little Use, (Comment from a concerned Sgt). This 1994 question book is of little value. The book that it is suppose to be modeled after, "Supervision of Police Personnel" has changed significantly since 1994. This study guide of the past consists of confusing questions with no explanations. It is not a study guide and certainly cannot replace the text book, unless you don't mind doing poorly on a promotional exam. Since the page numbers and the chapters have changed in the actual text book, I found this book to be very frustrating. Save your mental energy.$LABEL$0

What a feeling....not!. I tried numerous times to like this '80s classic but I can't.

excellant replacement buckle. this is a review for the 2 inch side release buckle-black. this is a replacemnet for the waist buckle on my army heavy transport MOLLE back pack. the previous buckle had been stepped on so i definatly needed a new one and a replacement. the other reviewer said that "They cheaped out and put the webbing grip only on 1 side of the buckle" BUT he is wrong they didnt cheap out its intended that way for a reason. you only need the male end of the buckle to grip the webbing so that in a case where u need to get your pack on or off quick you dont have to deal with adjusting the female end tighter or looser just slide and clip. this buckle is very good and while i cant say it will stand up to a 250 pound guy stepping on it it will keep your pack NICE AND TIGHT$LABEL$1
Looks good, but not practical for long-term use. I purchased this product and wrote a review about it in another review page for the same item. In a nutshell: the bolts are round, but the bolt openings in the riser are wide and oval -- and after day-to-day usage this poor attachment design makes the riser shift out of place. Unlike a toilet seat, you will never be able to tighten this toilet seat riser enough to prevent it from moving.$LABEL$0
Yet another shiny piece of junk toaster. What's funny is other reviewers either love this thing or hate it. Nothing in between. I'm going to guess the lovers like light toast and the haters like dark toast. I'm very particular about my toast, and I'm a hater...This thing looks shiny and cool, but toasts bread unevenly--it burns one tip of the bread and leaves the opposite unheated!!!! I think it has too much empty space and not enough elements for even toasting. The early release lever takes a struggle to operate. Then it flings the toast onto the counter, which is great for cartoons but not for reality. And the oven part has no timer so it's burned everything I've ever put in it.If you want toast, the best thing to do nowadays is buy the cheapest and smallest toaster you can find--once a year. They're all made in China, they're all junk, and few of them last more than a year. I bet Chinese don't even eat toast!$LABEL$0

Reviewing the BOOK not the SELLER here. This book reads like the instruction manual for a rocket ship.

History of Newton County, Mississippi 1834-1894. An excellent study of pertinent facts relating to the early history of Newton County, Mississippi. A. J. Brown uses many sources to inform his reader, including verbal interviews of residents of Newton County, court records, federal census records, state records and newspaper accounts. This book is of interest to those who wish to learn more about early settlers of Newton County, and what life was like for citizens after the Civil War. It does not touch upon every family. The primary focus is on those the writer believes are the leading citizens, therefore, those seeking a comprehensive study of this area may be disappointed. However, this history does provide a general feel for the time and place with some detailed discussion.Charlotte GressettGenealogy researcher$LABEL$1

A Grotesque Caricature. Tom Wolfe clearly has not been to college in the last 50 years, because his portrait of college life is so vastly overblown and beleaguered with every stereotype assigned to today's world of higher education that the story itself is completely lost. There is little that is original or even interesting is his truly one-dimensional novel about a girl who can only be characterized as the single most nave college student on the planet, complemented by every jock and frat boy stereotype that exists in nature. I happen to be familiar with the university this novel is based on and I can say that he appears not to have really delved fully into his research in regard to what college life is like there. I feel a more realistic and not so oversexed and oversimplified novel could have been a successful book. But this just reeks of an old man outside his generation grasping at what he thinks people want to read about college life.$LABEL$0
Very disappointed..Buy the book. I'd wanted to see the movie for some time now and was given the book as a gift. The book itself was pretty good but was so descriptive it ruined the movie for me. I finished the book on Sunday and decided to rent instead of buying the movie on Wednesday. I was excited to see the movie but was instantly disappoint. It deviated from the book a little which was fine but the story seemed to go so fast; trying to fit as much into an hour and a half as possible. I'm a fan of all of the actresses d absolutely loved the acting of Sophie Okonedo, who played the part of sister May. All in all the movie was both over and under-acted.I don't know if I would have liked the movie had I not read the book. There were heartwarming moments and I shed a tear or two but all in all I'm glad I didn't purchase the movie. I actually could have waited until it aired o cable.$LABEL$0

Wrong Book. I received the wrong book. NO ONE ON AMAZON HAS THIS VERSION! When I purchased the book, there were 2 sellers. One selling for $50-ish and the other at $200 (not the book, but some program?). I ordered the $50-ish priced book. When I received it, it was the CS3 version. I called the seller who told me it was the same book with a "few new details". He also said it was Amazon's fault for listing it incorrectly. He told me I should keep it and use it for a while. I opened it that day and it was NOT the same book with a few new details! Some of the menu items were not even available. I called the seller again and he said I could send it back, but I had to pay the shipping. Nice. THEY send me the wrong book and I have to pay to return it.$LABEL$0

Should be required reading!. This book was incredible -- and unlike any other book on church life and growth I have read. It should be required reading for any member of a church. Mr. Scazzero addresses one of the most over-looked or denied problems in churches - emotional immaturity. Too many Christians have voluminous knowledge of Scripture, but no idea how this should apply to them as an emotional being. This book shows how to have real, authentic fellowship in a body of believers, and how to be strive for the emotional maturity that is modelled in Christ.$LABEL$1

Excellent Resource. Great menu ideas, good recipes.This cookbook is a gem! A lot of quantity-cooking cookbooks have recipes for things like slop and canned-cream-of-whatever-soup special. This book has simple, classy recipes along with strategies for serving a crowd of people.All of the recipes I have tried from this book have been great. Once you see her proportions and suggested quantities, it is also easy to scale other favorite recipes to serve a larger group of people.This contains recipes and menus for different-sized crowds and for different occasions (from elegent dinners to picnics).Excellent resource. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1
Found it as a bore. I read the first 4 chapters, i told myself this book will be good, but i just could not finish it, it never picked up. Im glad i got the book for free.

This book might blow you away.... ...with it's ability to explain this twist of nature at a level young children can understand. I was most impressed with the fact that not only does it describe the scientific aspects of tornado formation in simple terms, it also discusses tornado safety by giving kids several examples of where they might be when a tornado hits and the best place to take cover for each situation. While the publisher lists ages 4-8 as the targeted reading level, I found with our library groups at school that our 9-11 year olds were very interested in it as well. If you have younger children and live in an area where tornadoes are a real threat, I highly recommend using this book to introduce tornado safety.$LABEL$1

This book is embarrasing. This book is not what you want for reveiwing for the SAT II Physics test. It attempts to make the subject material seem easy and ends up over simplifying most of it. Many of the practice test's questions are flawed and have conflicting answers in the answer keys. The second practice test has almost nothing to do with the material discussed in the book. I got a 760 on the first test and a 610 on the second. Do not buy this book.$LABEL$0
Broke on First Use. Rather than push out the pin in the chain link, the tool's pushpin sheared in half.I suspect that part may have been defective, though, and this review isn't a blanket condemnation of the Super tool or Topeak.The reason why is, I was able to complete the chain repair using the chain tool included in my Topeak Alien II multitool. No problem with that one. So Topeak can make a chain tool that works. I might have just gotten a bum pushpin in my Super.I bought the Super in the first place because I figured the chain tool in the Alien II would be flimsy. The Alien II chain tool was to be a backup, and it performed well.I'll probably replace this with the more expensive Park CT-3, though.$LABEL$0

Olympus lens small size, light weight, but most important sharp images.. I purchased this lens to use on my E-520 and I was surpised at the compactness of this lens. I took photos at a circus and a wedding so far and I am impressed with the sharpness of the images. It could easily be carried as a prime lens for travel, especially if you are outdoors. It does hesitate some on focusing in very low light situations. Overall what a deal for great Olympus optics at $100 from Amazon. It is well worth the price.$LABEL$1

A Good Place to start. The medical profession in general see's co-dependency as a disease that is permanent, progressive and incurable. So you can imagine my delight when I opened this book and read, that this is not so. I am co-dependant and have stumbled through my life not really knowing why I attracted time after time negative and distructive situations within my relationships. This book has given me a glimmer of hope in that I can turn this around. One of the biggest challenges I face is understanding what happened in my life for me to be in the position I am now. This book has given me the answers to my questions and more....it has provided me with a starting point to recovery and to acquire the life skills that will enable me to have the kind of relationships with others that is my divine right.$LABEL$1

Should have been better. Room 33 is about a troubled young couple and a roller derby team who get stranded in an abandoned mental hospital where a crazy girl is running around and people are turning up dead sans eyeballs. Good luck figuring out much of anything beyond that. I guess the actual killer is supposed to be the crazy chick's dead father who is living on as one of her multiple personalities and was the head doctor at this place. Why is he dead? Got me. Why is he killing people? No idea. Too bad the script is such a mess, because they had the makings of a decent b-horror flick for the first half. The girls were cute and you start to care about some of them. The acting is poor but not offensive, it was filmed pretty well, but the script and plot holes are what really hurt it. Still, for budget horror you could do a whole lot worse (Secrets of the Clown, dear God).$LABEL$0

Slick Little Camera. The value of this camera is its size and convenience. It does not take great photos, but for the most part, outdoor pix are not too bad. I compared exact shots from my olympus 2 and 3 megapixel, and the colors from the casio were a little washed out- not true to color. Indoor shots with low light are bad, as the flash is so small it does not produce very good photos. These are the drawbacks. I got this camera to have when I don't want to carry my larger camera and to take places that I would not otherwise have taken the other. It is cool and will draw a crowd. You will need to get an additional SD card if you want to take any number of pix, but they are cheap now. Final note, the usb/charging cradle that came with it is very nice and works well- I did not install any of their software as Win XP immediatley picked up and installed the driver.$LABEL$1
Utilitarian Headphones. Darn good head phones if you have that remarkable ability to break everything you own. The ear pieces are quite sturdy, made of aluminum. At first are awkward to put on, but once you get them "set" they don't even feel there. Comes with a nice case, too big for a pants pocket but good for a jacket pocket or purse. Sound quality is decent, these aren't DJ quality headphones, mainly due to the lack of bass; overall sound quality is crisp and clear. And lastly, the ear pieces are not heavy enough to use as a bolo, so home defense is out of the question for this item. However, if you are an assassin, the wire seams strong enough to work as a garote.$LABEL$1

So nice to have pancakes again. After weeks on the limited choices in Atkins, trying this mix was nice alternative to eggs every morning! The consistency was a little chewy and the taste quite egg-y, but with sugar-free maple syrup I was still in heaven with every bite. I also sprinkled on some cinnamon for flavor. However, next time I'll try reducing to one egg instead of two, and see if this helps cut down the egg-iness. Not bad overall!$LABEL$1
Detailed Method For Buckskins. The author took the complex task of making buckskins and makes it even harder by explaining the most minute details of the process. I was looking for more step by step detail on hide tanning. This book will be great for you if you really want every detail explained.

Don't Buy AT&T phones, AT&T doesn't Back Their Product. I purchased this phone through ANTOnline. (AT&T; E5917).The answering system is OK but the cordless handset was defective. I contacted AT&T; and we both determined (AT&T; and I) that they phone was defective and they told me I had to contact ANTOnline. I contacted ANTOnline and they told me to contact AT&T; directly, so I tried emailing AT&T.; After giving AT&T; information back and forth in the email they told me to contact them through the phone. And around and around it goes. I cannot waste anymore of my time for a $10 handset. I am very disappointed in AT&T; and find that their customer service is not what it used to be. So let the buyer beware -- cannot return defective items!!!!$LABEL$0
This has got to be a joke!. Thought I'd check out what 'death metal' is about, so listened to the track samples for this album - unbelievable! I'm astonished that anyone in their right mind could find pleasure in listening to this horrendous noise - 'music' is hardly an appropriate descriptive term here. So, if this band is at all representative of the genre, my advice to the uninitiated is: steer well clear if you like your ears! For a real 'Brainstorm' check out the track of this name on Hawkwind's 'Doremi Fasol Latido' album.$LABEL$0

She Loves (LOVES) this thing!. I sincerely believe I could have dumped Baby Jaguar, his cast, the tapir, the feeding dish, XRay and the stethescope and just given my daughter the Rescue Pack without batteries and she would have fallen in love with it. The other toys have largely been ignored in favor of the RP. Unfortunately, the thing came with pre installed batteries and all we've heard for the last couple of days is that thing talking.As a note, we got one of these for our son about 2 years ago. He also loved it. I have no idea what happened to it, but I rated this as highly durable because I know it lasted a long time before it vanished. His Baby Jaguar is still around...$LABEL$1

Totally wrong ending. Have you ever read a book that was absolutly perfect untill the end? The end of this book destroys the whole point of the fairy tale. I was so disapointed. It seemed that McKinley just threw everything together to create an ending. I was so excited, this book was so good untill the last two or three chapters. Then it just disgusted me. I would write a whole new ending for this book and then it would be perfect. But unless you want to write your own ending, don't waste time or money on this book. I must say though, that the sisters were great and I loved the way she wrote them. That was actually worth my time. I gave a star to each of them.$LABEL$0
Great idea, until it broke.. I purchased this exactly a year ago and have used it on a few trips. I was on a cross-country trip last week and used the unit for about the tenth time. It broke. As I pushed the plunger down I heard a crack. I now have coffee in between the inner and outer shells of the mug. Sadly, I will throw this away and purchase a better-quality unit for my travels. Nothing is better than having a good cuppa while on the road, and nothing was worse than that crack I heard, making this unit useless.I have two Bodum glass presses at home that I use several times a day; they continue to perform yeoman service.$LABEL$0

way overrated. this band was truly overrated.aside from songs like L.A woman&Light my fire what was so special about this group? the lead singer with personna but that's all.Jim Morrison was the 60's version of 2Pac a talented poet but not a great artist.but alot of personna that helped create the Myth&the Man.the music was lacking any real feeling and bottom line was just bad.a very overrated group if ever there was one.$LABEL$0
Very Unrealistic. I bought this book because other customer reviews raved about how wonderful it was. Well, I was very disappointed. It was so awful, I couldn't even read the book all the way through. The book is almost entirely made up of sample conversations that show you how you should be talking with your children. Unfortunately, the children in these conversations are unlike any child I know. In the book, the three-year-olds talk more like ten-year-olds. It is very unrealistic. I would give it zero stars if I could. I sent the book back.$LABEL$0
a good change of hero and heroine. It was a good read. It kept me interested in the beginning, but started to become predictable towards the end. You were still able to connect with and understand what the charcters were going through. It just kinda lost its fizz after awhile like soda when you leave it out. I wish the outcome was different in the end. It left me wondering WHAT? No way! After all that... it ends like this?This book had potential to be better, I wish it were.$LABEL$0
Junk Player. I will never by this brand. I ordered this player month back. After waiting for 20 days, I received the player.When I tried to play a DVD movie, only first ten minutes it played the movie in color, then color changed to pink and finally it displayed only Black and White.I called Cyberhome support, I did all kind of troubleshooting as per cyberhome supports instruction. No luck. Then I called Amazon, they said they will replace the unit.Last week I receive the my replacement unit. I think this unit is comparatively better. The reason is, it displayed the DVD movies in color for 20 to 30 minutes. And it goes to pink and finally Black and White.Today I am returning this unit also.It you check Cyberhome's web site support page, they say it you see pink are Black and White picture adjust the DVD setup. That is not true. It didn't work for the player I got it.This player is not even worth for single star.$LABEL$0
Disapointing. I loved the New Mickey Mouse Club from season 1, even as new episodes were showing while I was still in high school. I was very excited to see that Disney was releasing this, even if it were only a few episodes based around three of the many talented kids on the show. The fond memories I have that revolve around this show...However, the four episodes on this DVD did not highlight the talent of Christina, Britney and Justin or the rest of the cast for that matter. All the musical numbers (except one) were prerecorded from the MMC concert. The skits were not some of the best, but Keri Russel fans will probably get a kick out of seeing her in many of the episodes. I hope people who buy this DVD don't judge the entire show on these four episodes.$LABEL$0
Fabulous, cherish each story!. Miracles happen every day. Yitta Halberstam and Judith Leventhal are angels themselves, bringing these fantastic stories to millions of people.

Absolute worst customer service. We had major problems with our after-market radio. The installers tried a new radio that Sirius sent and a new antenna that they sent. Neither helped. My wife then called customer service and that was a huge mistake. She spent 2 hours being bounced around and hung up on. It was as if they didn't care about our business in any shape or form. Then they would say things like "I don't see any orders on your account so I can't help you." What does that even mean? They wanted to send another of the same model but we had already been through all that.In the end it was easier to cancel the service and eat all the money we'd put into it so far than to deal with them. Customer service/retention/tech support would not do anything for us. The radio service is great if it works, but if it doesn't, may the gods help you because Sirius won't.$LABEL$0
Ransom. This is the worst Lois Duncan Book I have ever read! The plot was well, and the characters were secure, but the way she kept the story going as if it didn't even have an end, made me want to stop reading it. I seriously FORCED myself to read this.Lois Duncan is my favorite author, and I have read fantastic books by her such as: Locked In Time, Stranger With My Face, and Down A Dark Hall. If you love reading suspense and thrillers, read these. But if you enjoy being bored and hate having to finish a book because you started it, read this.$LABEL$0
Second pair and counting.... I bought my first pair and loved them, now on second pair and still love them. Sturdy, forgiving but still rugged. Break in is fairly quick and I only have a little discomfort initially with the upper ankle area. This is due to the stiff rubber/plastic that wraps the ankle. I do not mind the break in period as this same piece offers good ankle support also. Only drawback is the price, ouch. I have never paid $200.00 which is the price at the time of this review as they are usually around 129.00 to 169.00.Overall a good boot and I also prefer them to the Acadia.$LABEL$1

Not for climbers !. Loved this gate until my son .. 17 months.. learned to climb ! He puts his toes in the gate and just climbs up and over it !It is attached to the kitchen counter, so he climbs up the gate on the counter and, well.. you can imagine the rest !So if you have a climber I would recommend one that has the long slats vs one that has "holes" in it for their toes ..$LABEL$0

Well worth the $. I would highly recommend this video for those looking to tone and slim but who don't want to spend too much time working out. Each workout is only 25 minutes and it is broken down into three circuits, plus a warm up and cool down. In each circuit 3 minutes are dedicated to strength training, 2 minutes to cardio, and 1 minute to abdominal work. This format makes it easy for quitters like me to push through a hard work-out since I know whatever I'm having trouble with will be over soon. The three different workouts keep things interesting and pack a punch. The only improvement would be an extended cool down period -- I often need to stretch more afterwards.$LABEL$1
Great sight, great price!. Easy five stars. I used this sight to replace the stock front sight on my Glock 23. I've never been a fan of Glock OEM sights. I blacked out the rear white "goal post" on the stock rear sight with a black marker and mounted the HiViz on the front with a little blue Loctite. Standard 3/16 nut driver ground down to fit in the slide works perfect to tighten the screw. Love this setup. It will be my go to set for all my pistols.$LABEL$1
A book that will appeal to the envy of America. 200 years ago, European nations dominated the world in absolutely every aspect-culturally, economically, militarily, etc. Now, in the 21st Century, the tables have dramatically changed across the Atlantic. The U.S. is now the strongest superpower the world has ever seen. For the first time in history, there is a nation out there with the might and influence greater than Europe COMBINED. If one doesn't believe me, just look the stats up and compare them. One example would be that the US spends more on its military and on technology than the rest of the world COMBINED, let alone old Europe. And people wonder why the most high-tech nation on Earth...$LABEL$0

Does not do well in the wind. My family bought a set (4-5) of these tents in the late 80's. Good looking. Easy to use.... Then the storm hit. The wind mangled these things into pretzels.

Now I have to read all his work!. The interest this book garnered due its nomination for Thw Whitbread Award was well deserved. My only disappointment was that it didn't win.Set during the 80's it charts the rise of Solidarity. Begging the question 'Remind me, so who are the good guys again?'This is a very emtional, personal journey. I laughed all the way through but it has moments of such poignancy I was very mved too. Not in that fake kind of maudlin may, but the real kind of feeling; real people,live,traumas and laughter.Put down everything else and read this now.$LABEL$1

Does not work for MX500 Mice. I bought this pad originally for my Intellimouse explorer mouse.Using the Intellimouse with this pad is a joy for a short while. A week later and my Mx500 arrived..this is where the problem started. I noticed the pointer moves in random directions when you move the mouse slowly. I thought that this was because the mouse had some tiny scratches on it. So i cleaned it and used it again..no luck.Today i went to staples to have it exchanged for a similar mousepad. To my dismay, the pointer still goes awry if you move the mouse slowly if used with a Mx500 mouse. So if you have a logitech mx controller.. proceed with caution.$LABEL$0

not what I hoped for. I loved...LOVED shake off the dust and live @ stubbs. I saw matis twice live and he was more incredible than words can explain. Of course I respect his right as an artist to grow, evolve, and expand. But for me, this album seemed to get away from what made Matty matter to me. i'll keep listening but, have been playing the old album since. It seems he went for a poppier sound, trying to cross over genres and reach more people. his original sound put him in the spolight and now he's gonna switch it up... fine. it's just not there for me.$LABEL$0

Makes me ashamed for the author.... Good grief, why did that little line at the start... "without editorial input' not warn me?Sure the top writers around the world need editors, but this work is so perfect it doesn't?The grammar and spelling mistakes littered through the book are atrocious. Even some of the worst fanfiction writers manage to run spell-check.Then a character arrived with 'violet eyes', a fanfiction favourite that should have sent me running to the hills.I like the idea of bringing fantasy into the grittier parts of Britain, but everything else here has been done to death. Villains laugh hysterically; heroes stand dramatically shouting 'NO!' to the horizon; everyone is extraspeciallysuper beautiful and handsome.$LABEL$0

Elsie's story continues. This is the fifth book in a series, though this and the fourth book didn't have too much to do with the first three books. The first three - 'Fourth Grade Wizards', 'Nothing's Fair in the Fifth Grade', and 'Sixth Grade Can Really Kill You', were set in elementary school, but the last two books focused on Elsie Edwards.Elsie made her first appearance in 'Nothing's Fair in the Fifth Grade' and was in the next book, though with a considerably smaller role. Here, she's seventeen and no longer fat after losing weight in the fifth grade. But she still has plenty of insecurities (as shown in the fourth book) and this book is geared for older readers, but still rather good if you read the rest of this series.$LABEL$1

Good speakers, poor quality user manual. I bought a pair of these to replace the blown woofers in my 30 year old Advent loudspeakers. I needed to enlarge the hole in the speaker boxes slightly to make them fit. (No problem here, Pyle makes no claim they will fit the Advent boxes.) The speakers sound great. The only reason this review is not 5 stars is the user manual, which is full of typos and obviously translated into very fractured English. But this is not a big deal.$LABEL$1
Only use if you are an octopus!. I was so excited to get this wrap. My baby constantly wanted to be held and I thought this would make us both happy. I was very wrong. It arrived and when I opened it I knew we were going to have issues. It came with a very thick instruction manual and the option to watch a video online. Still, I gave it a try. Many tries. The thing is very very long. First you have to fold it in half lengthwise, then you have to drape it this way and that way, pick up and position the baby, then wrap and tie it. Perhaps if I had eight arms or someone to help me, this would have worked. However, after using it a few times, I returned it. I opted for a more traditional type carrier that I could get the baby in and out of myself...with my own TWO arms :)$LABEL$0
Pass the Cheese. Ok yes this is a cheesy love or hate movie, but the one thing that I will mention that I hadnt seen in another review was of the audio commentay track by the director. Listenting to him discuss many of the choices both from a plot standpoint as well as an editorial standpoint was very entertaining. Without it i would say just rent the video to get it out of your system but he commentary actually makes this worth owning and watching more than once.$LABEL$1
The Best Point-n-shoot I have ever used. I love its portability, ease-of-use and picture quality. It has enough options to control exposure, timings, color temp etc for a amateur photographer. (The 5-star ratings are keeping in mind what I expect from a point-n-shoot camera. Obviously the picture quality is not as good as a SLR.) I have used it extensively and loved every bit of it. Except recently, when it died due to lens error. I guess some particles (sands?) got stuck in the lens system. Now it fails to start. The repairing cost is not justified. I would highly recommend this camera unless you are a serious photographer and need something more than point-n-shoot.$LABEL$1

If I could give it a ZERO, I would!!. This is the worst phone I have ever owned...and I've had many. Sure, it's cute and light, but the phone is constantly dropping calls, gets TERRIBLE reception, decides not to ring when it feels like it and the battery life is about 36 hours with no talking and about 24 hours if you talk for about 1-2 hours (in battery save mode). I certainly would NOT recommend this phone to anyone. I had a Motorola before this which was absolutely wonderful, even after I dropped it in my dog's water dish! I thought this phone would be equally as great, but I'm very disappointed!! With my old phone I had perfect reception everywhere in my apartment, now I have to stand by the window and most times this phone won't ring in the apartment at all.The things that I do like over my old phone is the option to have true tones and it takes better pictures. Not worth it though! Think twice before buying this phone!$LABEL$0
Have you heard of tunnel vision?. This book is very disappointing. I was even appalled at the nerve of the author to re-release this book and identify the man he THINKS is the Zodiac killer after the man's death. The author actually demonstrates how an investigation can get botched with tunnel vision. A prime suspect is the sole focus and evidence is distorted any way it can be to "prove" this suspect is the Zodiac killer. There were other possible leads and suspects that were discounted by the author.By the time you reach the middle of the book, you'll see it is already obvious who the author THINKS is the Zodiac killer. The rest of the book discounts other leads and suspects and focuses on "evidence" that "proves" the author has identified the Zodiac Killer. Very disheartening.It should be noted the author is not an investigator and the identity of the Zodiac killer remains a mystery to this day. The author has NOT proven his "identification" of the Zodiac killer. This book is a shame.$LABEL$0

Epson R2400 Print Results. I purchased the R2400 from B&H, NYC. After a brief installation set up, I was ready to print. The images came out streaking from upper right to bottom left. After speaking to Epson tech support I was instructed by them to return the unit because"it should not be streaking diagonally, ecspecially right out of the box". I exchanged the unit with another one and experienced the same problem. Whether I printed from photshop or iphoto the streaks continued on 99% of my prints (with Epson paper). After trading emails w/ Epson tech. support, I ended up returning the 2nd unit as well. Maybe I hit a bad batch but the R2400 was for me, an exercise in frustration.$LABEL$0
THIS IRON IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!. I purchased this flat iron from Amazon EXACTLY 60 days ago and this morning, when I plugged it in the red light turned on.....when I came back to straighten my hair a little while later, the light was off and the iron was cool. After going to work with frizzy hair I returned home to try it again...no luck. I should have listened to the other negative reviews on this site. The iron is not covered by the warranty because it was purchased from Amazon, not an authorized hair salon! I took my chances when ordering the iron because the price was right....Buyer BEWARE, spend a few more dollars and buy it from a hair salon. Ulta Beauty has the iron for a similar price when it's on sale! Like some other reviewers I think this is a cheaper version of the ones that sell in salons. My daughter has the Paul Brown flat iron and it's been great for over a year!$LABEL$0

Kids Enjoy the Content. This was purchased for two little ones, ages 2 and 1. The content features Pim, an animated panda, intermixed with footage of children and parents in everyday situations. Basic objects and actions are introduced then repeated several times before being used in simple phrases and sentences. There is a menu option to see English subtitles. It would be great (for adults) if there was also an option to see the Chinese vocabulary spelled out phonetically in English. However, the kids are obviously the target audience and they seem to really enjoy the videos.$LABEL$1

The mob-busters' point of view. Written by two of the FBI agents who in 1981 bugged the home of mob boss Paul Castellano, head of New York's Gambino famiy, Boss of Bosses is a nail-biter that keeps you on the edge of your seat. We follow them as they place their surveillance equipment and then monitor Castellano's day-to-day activities. Along the way they pick up juicy information about the boss's personal life, particularly his love for the family maid and the lengths he will go to please her. Some readers have complained that the book is more soap opera than true crime, but I think that's a big part of its strength. The authors show the godfather as a real man not just a power on a Mafia throne. The book is also good background on the conditions within the family that led to Castellano's assassination and the ascent of John Gotti.$LABEL$1
The Best Book on the Subject of Spot Metering!. Too many photo "how to" books slide right over the importance of metering, especially spot metering. You wonder why your photos lack the detail and color that your remembered when you shot that picture. This book is wonderful. It is the only book that I have come across that explains in great detail how the camera works and how to determine the exposure you desire using the spot meter. You will be amazed at how much better your photos will be if you turn off that automatic stuff and let your brain decide what your exposure should be. After you have read those books about aperture, shutter speed and depth of field (they all seem to read the same), read this book to learn how to expose/meter correctly. I am so glad that I did!$LABEL$1

Similar ideas are stated in different ways many times in the book. Although stated differently, many times, a sentence states the same idea that was stated previously. This happens many times. Many many ideas are repeated many many times. It gets redundant.$LABEL$0
What the ????. This CD is filled with poor choices from the beginning, but I'm wondering if anyone experienced what I have? My tracklisting is totally off! The CD cover warns one to refer to the booklet inside for correct track listing (which moves song #15 (I Need You) to song #3, thus placing "Lost" in 4th position. So..when you play the CD the song titles do not match the song that's playing. After song #3 you're always going to be off by one song. SO Annoying. You have to go in and manually change the title off each song in your IPOD. Just another dent in an already poor release.$LABEL$0
Too expensive. Like printer ink these little bits of plastic and magnets are total rip-offs. Look that them. $12 each? Give me a break. And then they "recommend" throwing it away after three months. I used my last one for two years. When the handle goes, I will NOT be buying another one of these.$LABEL$0
works poorly. The shuffler flips cards over several times during one shuffle so that we have several cards rightside up when we draw. This is disconcerting when playing. It also jams often and we have to stop and unjam it before we can finish shuffling. The only good things I can say about this shuffler is that it does handle four decks with ease and its easier to deal with these problems than to shuffle four decks by hand.$LABEL$0
You need to work with this for accuracy. I guess this makes sense if you want to look and have a number. Easy to read dial. It is "lightweight" so it is shaky to secured and the bimetal spring is not protected .I have had to move it from the place for where I wanted it to a place that was my 3rd star choice for accuracy. I have to say it is a fluff piece if you work off the temp. I have had it out there for 6 months in New England weather and it has survived it's first winter. So I added a star.$LABEL$0
A great film, but not a masterpiece. The film noir is an interesting genre. Most are crafted in a brilliant manner but the conclusion of the film seems to fall apart, not to mention some of the explanations make no sense. Chinatown has been considered to have one of the greatest endings ever filmed. While it was good, the denouement of Chinatown was definitely rushed and that hindered the film. L.A. Confidential is another noir film, and while it bears similarities to Chinatown, I feel Confidential is the better film. There are many engaging characters with more humor and action. The plot twists are as intriguing as the ones in Chinatown. The performances, especially Russel Crowe, are outstanding. It would be hard to explain this film in a couple of sentences, so I think you should just watch this movie for yourself. Overall, it is a great film, but a rather hard to believe conclusion hurts it.$LABEL$1
Better stuff out there for $300. with regards to sound, this is a very good headsetThe noise cancelling features are very good ---- unfortunately, the 'phones suffer from discomfort and priceI compared these headphones, head to head, on an airplane, against the Sony MDR NC20, and there was no difference in sound - both performed excellently, and equally, within the airplane environment ---- however, the Sony ones were more comfortable and MUCH cheaperDon't even waster your time with the Bose Quite Comfort ---- grab a pair of the Sony's and you'll fall in love!$LABEL$0

Give In and Send Money. The premise of this book seems to be: Your child is a legal adult, so don't tell him/her what to do, just send money. Yes, that's right, I felt that the book seemed to advise doing exactly as the son or daughter would prefer. I had hoped for a guide to ensuring that certain standards are met, in order to justify the flow of money. You know, like decent grades, reasonable plans for finishing on time, no wasting money on luxury purchases while Mom and Dad are sacrificing to pay tuition, etc. Instead, what I found was a guide to feeling OK about giving up those expectations. Not so useful.$LABEL$0
Good reference if you know what you're doing. After having read the first thousand or so pages, I'm finally getting the hang of it. I've read all the good reviews on this one and I'm almost afraid to slam it, but it took me a long time to appreciate this book. It was recommended as the best reference on JavaScript, and now that I know what I'm doing, I would have to say it's a pretty good reference. I guess I was expecting javascript to be as easy to pick up as HTML. Wrong! I didn't realize how much closer javascript is to actual programming.$LABEL$1

Cute and comfortable. Glad I bought them. I own LOTS of shoes so unless there is a great price or a shoe in a color or pattern I don't have then I'm forced to pass. But I found these in a brown alligator print for $20.99 on Amazon. I decided to order them at 8.5 which I can wear in this brand if they are not too narrow.They fit great. A half size larger wouldn't hurt but these fit fine and they are super cute. Add another pair of awesome Bandalinos to my collection.$LABEL$1
Tecno Joe!. That's right- Joe Satriani has gone techno! With that being said though, this CD is chock full of BLISTERING LEAD WORK. If you are looking for the crunchy metal hooks ala "Surfing With the Alien" or "Crystal Planet", you WILL NOT find them here. The old, worn out metal themes have been replaced with dense textured synths, electronic drums, and synth guitars. This is absolutely the most original guitar recording to come out in a LONG time. The lead work is phenomenal (as usual), but this time it takes on an exotic, improvised jazzy feel. Standout tunes include "Devil Slide" with it's machine gun synth guitar rhythms and dueling solos, the atmospheric Rush styled "Flavor Crystals", and "Borg Sex" which digitally builds to an AWESOME solo climax. Joe certainly had his creative engines running full throttle and if you will listen with an OPEN mind, you will see that he has trailblazed a new path for instrumental guitar.$LABEL$1
Not the worst I've read -- but it comes close.... Having met Robert Wise, I had high hopes for this novel when I started it. Unfortunately, after less than one chapter I realized that those hopes were ill-founded. "The Dead Detective" lacks all of the things that make novels readable -- interesting characters, snappy dialogue, believable plotlines. Instead, we are given one-dimensional characters, cliche-driven dialogue and a plot which simply never makes sense.I will quantify all of this by saying that, if you have loved every novel in the "Left Behind" series, you might really like Mr. Wise's novels. If, however, you are looking Christian literature on the level of Frank Peretti, Randy Alcorn or Ted Dekker, you should look elsewhere. In the world of Christian fiction, there are many great choices. This simply isn't one of them.$LABEL$0
Good song selection, great Riddim. I'll start by saying that this cd is loaded with todays top dancehall stars. With stars like Elephant man, Vybz Kartel, Bounty Killer, and Zumjay plus many more. My cd however I think is defective because I can hear little skips but they are hardly noticed. This is a great dancehall riddim that has been used by many stars for good reason it's Great!! From the same guy who made the ever popular Diwali riddim probably the most popular riddim ever made!! So this would be a great choice for someone who likes dancehall. I would also recommend The Diwali riddim cd from Greensleeves, it has many great artists like, Spragga Benz, Elephant Man, T.O.K., Danny English and Egg Nog, Bling Dawg and many more!!!$LABEL$1

pseudo-analytic nonsense. This book is completely useless for a serious web designer. Completely misguided from an aestetics point of view, this book doesn't go further than a pseudo-analysis of design style. Even the "techniques" section is really a couple of "how to copy this" advice, nothing deeper or broader.The novice won't find anything to grasp the essentials or fundamentals of what design really is (or a particular "style" for that matter), the pro will find this useless. Don't even think about usability of cource.There is much more to design than this book suggests and certainly freshness doesn't come from copying a style bound to be trivial in a couple of months but from analysing and deepening in what design for web is.If you come from a design background you are already well equiped so, look for something on usability rather.If you are a novice avoid this copycat approach to design and look for something on the fundamentals.$LABEL$0

Horrible and pervasive chemical odor. It is pretty hard to criticize a fitness ball. I have seen this brand at several gyms and the quality seems durable enough. Unfortunately, the ball has such a pervasive and intense odor that it is impossible to keep in your home. I truly can't emphasize this enough. After putting it in the closet, the smell transferred to all of my clothes. Finally, I put it in the hallway of my building (a small 3 story Victorian). Even after a week, the *entire* building smells like this weird chemical odor. And the halls are wide and airy (with no heat). I cringe at the thought of actually bumping into one of my neighbors. I have held off returning this in the hopes that the ball would air out. But no such luck. Returning these items is always a drag, and it is hard not to be just a little resentful at the lack of quality control.$LABEL$0

The story line is slow very slow. The main character is a manic depressive woman who is very annoyed with life because it is unfair, and she ended up in the wrong side of the table. So she resents everyone that happened to be lucky enough to avoid life traps and despises those who fell on them. Eventhough the book is beautifully written, the dark mood that the author impress on its main character, permeates to the reader and you become up caught in an atmosphere whereby reading is an effort, so each page develops slow, very slow.$LABEL$1

If you buy one book for UltraDev this one should be the one!$LABEL$1
Not worth the time or money. This book repeats a few of the strategies presented in "The E-Myth Revisted", trying to point them at the contractor. Unfortunately, except for a couple of good ideas from that book, there is nothing here but fluff and pep talk. At one point, I think you can actually tell where material was cut-and-pasted from the sister book about medical practices, where they accidentally forgot to change "practice" to "contracting business".If you found some chapters of the "The E-Myth Revisted" to be a bit fluffy for you, you can count on an entire (although short) book of it here. Very dissapointing and not particularly useful.$LABEL$0
Unusual. Brand New is a band that I just do not understand. Lately, I have found myself listening to Deja Entendu frequently on someones itunes playlist on my local network, and I am puzzled. This cd has absolutly no flow at all. Some of the tracks do not even sound like the same band, especially "Play Crack The Sky," which sounds exactly like a Counting Crows song. The good thing about this album is that they aren't doing the exact same thing as every other band in this oversaturated genre. However, much of this seems forced, and that they are trying to hard to be different. I cannot stand the track titles either.$LABEL$0
Great film noir. I'm watching this film for about the 10th time as I write this. It is an interesting study of vengeance by the father of a murdered girl who comes to America to find and kill her murderers. There is an interesting subplot in which an older and unreleased film by Terence Stamp is used to show the backstory when he was a young man and his daughter was a child. This subplot finally explains what has happened in the modern story. It is similar and far superior to a recent film called "Taken." In both cases, the father, who has near superhuman skills, takes off after a man who has kidnapped or ( in the Limey's case) murdered his daughter. This is a better film but both are enjoyable. I can watch this one over and over. I'm not sure about the newer film.$LABEL$1

Nothing personal - just not worth the purchase.Willie$LABEL$0
A GOOD COMPILATION FROM HIS ARISTA YEARS. I happen not to agree with the other only review on this album.This CD is a solid example of Iggy's amazing and hilarious extravaganza during the years 1979, 1980, 1981.Sure it would be better to buy the albums "New Values", "Soldier" and "Party", but if you're unsure of how Iggy sounded in the early 80's, then "Pop Music" is a good place to start.$LABEL$1
Perfect..... CRT has really done the impossible....they have brought the complete table of contents of the book to life, and maintained faithfulness to the stories (it's not really a novel) and to Bradbury's poetic prose, and that is no mean feat. It's spread over 6 discs and runs nearly six hours. Jerry Robbins and the CRT have numerous productions under their belt and are the most prolific of production companies in the genre of "theater of the ear". Give them a try, you won't be sorry.$LABEL$1

Best book ever, a must read for all!. Dark Horses and Black Beauties was a greatly moving book. It can teach not only horse enthusiasts but also people who don't know much about the equine. It was very strong and moving and the author didn't beat around the bush with what she was trying to get across. She adressed many of the major issues that are being dealt with in the equine world. She also went out and persued a personal insite in the horse world and didn't base her book off of strict facts. A GREAT book! Couldn't keep my nose out of it. I definitely recomend for anyone!$LABEL$1

Excellent introduction leaving one wanting more. This slim volume explores the way that music implements the liturgical intent and, to some extent particularly with the antiphons, the way changes in liturgy are reflected by changes in music. Especially interesting is the segment on the relationship between homilectics and music.The music explored ranges from chant to 20th century - the latter more by reference than by analysis. It includes instrumental music and cantatas as well as the classic music of the Mass.One need not be a musician nor a liturgical historian to understand this book. But reading the book will help a liturgist understand the liturgical musician and the historical development of their role.Highly recommended for anyone involved in liturgical planning.$LABEL$1
better than the 1st. I liked this much better than the 1st but I liked the 4th much better than the 2nd. I like this one the 2nd most because I like the part when he kills the teacher. I had to watch it over and over again so i decided to buy it. Its got the best music that would keep you watching it over and over. I think this movie should be watched by all since its a great seqeul to Chucky fans.$LABEL$1

Making the spiritual journey..... ...and that's not a bad thing!! Kristine W has always managed to stay atop the dance charts by making albums that capture the current musical landscape. This album is no exception. I did notice that Kristine seems to be taking a more "spiritual" attitude in her lyrics. As I was listening, I couldn't help but feel like she was having a real moment as she was singing...like every song sung was a small burden lifted from her shoulders. It is really great when an artist can convey such emotion like that, while treating us to an excellent landscape of danceable musical textures. The additional disc, mixed by Chris Cox, is really well done also. Everything is listenable...and enjoyable. It's highly recommended!$LABEL$1

It's all been said. I bought this game from Amazon. It hasn't arrived yet, but when it does I'm not sure if I'll even install it because of the DRM issue, specifically the 3 installs limit.

Going through the motions. I'm a big Joseph Finder fan and I have to say that I was very disappointed in his latest novel. I took this book with me on vacation and I have to say it was a chore to get though. The story could have been written in about 200 pages, not this 500 + behemoth. It appears that Mr. Finder was just going through the motions to satisfy his booking agent. The story was so cookie cutter written. It was like some one gave him a formula to follow. The twists and "surprise" ending was so predictable that you had it figured out 50 pages before it happened. Luckily, I had other books with me on the trip to remind me of the magic of reading. Let's hope that Mr. Finder spends a little more time on his next book or he will soon be on his way to the bargain bin.$LABEL$0

It moves air. My PS3 gets pretty warm in my entertainment center, so I decided to get this to help circulate some air. It does what I intended it to do. I like the fact that it's a USB device. Since I have it plugged into my PS3, it's only on when I have the PS3 turned (I originally plugged it into the powered USB hub that I have hooked up to my PS3, and it stayed on, as there's no power switch.) There is a control knob to adjust the fan speed, which is a nice touch. I noticed several reviews commenting about how quiet this fan is. I suppose it is if you have the power down to 50% or less... When it's cranked up, it makes way more noise than my PS3's fan (which is fairly loud itself!)Over all, it's a nice solid build, and if you're in the market for a USB powered fan, I see no reason why you shouldn't look at this one!$LABEL$1

Outward Bound Pet Gear Bag. This product could have been quite functional except that it had a very strong ruber-tire smell which I think would have permeated anything in it or near it. I just couldn't tolerate the smell. Thus, I didn't use it.

Save your money. I have always wanted to go to Thailand and I bought this DVD in the hope of convincing my husband but I honestly think it had the opposite affect! If you are just planning to go to Bangkok than this DVD may be useful for you as about 2/3rds of the DVD is based on Bangkok. It also shows Chaing Mai but only really covers Thai cooking and massage classes and doesn't really show what there is to do there.I got my hopes up when the DVD moves to the South of Thailand and the islands (the area I am most interested in seeing) but it actually only spent about 7 or 8 minutes on this!I was considering putting my copy back on to sell but I don't think it is very fair to make anyone else suffer through it!I have found the Insight Guides (discovery channel) Thailand book much more interesting and useful and worth the money.$LABEL$0
Well written, but forgot about Clark. Ambrose shows his literary expertise as he chronicles the most famous exploring duo in American history. Using journals and other first person witness accounts, the reader is treated to a detailed description of Lewis and Clark's expedition to the pacific. While the research was extensive, Ambrose does relegate Clark to a minor role as he concentrates more on Lewis and Jefferson which would undoubtedly upset Lewis who consistently emphasized the equality of the two captains. The reader should not be surprised, as the title emphasizes this point about the thesis. Despite this pro-Lewis bias, Undaunted Courage is a great resource for information on the Corps of Discovery.$LABEL$1

I Like It. I love this book. I had to force myself to but it down so I don't read though it all at once. I find that the characters are very real, and other than the initial event (the Rapture) all of the following events sound realistically possible (in a novel). I have read many negative reviews from Christians denouncing that it doesn't exactly follow the Bible. And from others saying that it's nothing but religious evangelicalism. To all of those I say "It's a novel". It's fiction. It doesn't have to follow other sources and the writers can say what they want.To me it is a perfect mix, not too far out there and not too much preaching.I would recommend it to anyone interested. If you don't like the first book then don't read the rest.$LABEL$1

Go with the Shure headphones, you'll be sure glad you did!. These headphones do an excellent job of cancelling out background noise and its nice that they come with a box full of optional earplugs. The headphones came out in 2004, which i'm sure at that time were amazing headphones. But it is 2009 and I believe that Etymotic should redesign their headphones. These headphones are no match for the Shure SE420's. When you wear these headphones you will feel like Frankenstein because they stick out from your ears so awkwardly. I sent mine back and am now using the Shures.$LABEL$0
Not as good as the original, but still kickin' lotsa butt!. Blade is back, and he's more ticked than ever...seeing that he has to team up WITH vampires to fight off a mutant breed that's drinking the blood of both human's AND vampires. Double up the action and the weapons, but take away the level of gore the first one had and you pretty much have Blade II figured out. The DVD once again is sprawling and will eat up whatever time you give to it. A must have if you already own the first one. Those who aren't familiar might want to check out Blade first, and go from there.$LABEL$1
Great Value!. If you hate reading like I do, buy this book. It has killer colorful pages. If you are a beginner and would like to get your feet wet, look no further! If you are advanced user, you might want to think it over. Look at the index first before deciding on buying it.$LABEL$1

Not what is used to be?. I just saw a new one. I have a 30-year-old General No. 36. It was made in the USA, had two round knobs to hold the pivoting arms to the base, and came with two threaded ground-to-a-point pins that went through the base to help hold it in place on rough stock, or which could be reversed to screw into the base from the underside to center the bit on narrow stock. There is absolutely NO runout on the spindle, which fits into precision bushings. I had upgraded the chuck to an LFA to match a professional chuck on the AC-powered drill I usually use with this tool.It sounds like the current production is yet another made-in-China cheapened and downgraded version of what was once a useful tool. [sigh]$LABEL$0

Full of ideas, short on plot, loads of fun!. This book jumps around among multiple characters and multiple times, focusing on crytography during WW2 and the late 1990s. Even so, it is easy to follow. The characters are engaging, the history is interesting, and the book is often hilarious. There is lots of math and computer geekiana, but this doesn't serve as an impediment, even to a reader, like me, with only superficial knowledge of and interest in these things. It's a physically huge book, even in its smallest, mass-market version, but it's still a quick read. At the end, I had trouble summing up the plot, then decided I didn't care. It was a wild ride, and one with a much more satisfying ending than Stephenson's previous novels Snow Crash and The Diamond Age.$LABEL$1
Don't actually have this CD, but i have a reccomendation.... I haven't bought this CD yet, but i'm planning to, he's got a john mayor vibe, and something else...but i wanted to say that if you like Josh Kelly, and a little bit of Dave Mathews, you'd probably like my brother's cd...he's just an ordinary guy, but he's trying to make it in the music world, and he's got a lot of talent and deserves it.

The best. Miracle Rash Repair cream is one of the best products out there, and a lot less expensive than similar products, such as Corium 21.

False Advertising. I'm satisfied with the product, but the customer service or lack thereof is terrible. I believe the overall quality of a product to a certain degree is determined by the conduct of the company. Therefore, however unfortunate this is because the product by itself is excellent, I am rating this item with one star. Neither I nor my family or friends will ever do business with ProSavings. The issue was "free shipping" advertisement which I was drawn to, and gladly ordered two suits. I was confused when the billing came back with a $43.00 shipping cost. After numberous requests for an explanantion, ProSavings simply ignored my emails.$LABEL$0
Miserable.. I am not entirely sure that the individuals who rated this movie with more than one star saw the same movie I just watched.

Josh Groban in a bad evening. First of all, I'm a huge fan of Josh Groban's. Having listened to all his albums and watched all his DVDs, I got disappointed about Live At The Greek. Unlike many reviewers, the flashes, lights and the rock n'roll atmosphere didn't bother me, at all. The main problem, in my opinion, was his strained and nasal voice, which messed up with a lot of beautiful songs. "Mi Mancherai", "Caruso" and "Alla Luce del Sole" were just unrecognizable. It seems that he was congested and couldn't sing that day, but wasn't able to postpone the performance. Luckily, I've borrowed the DVD and haven't bought it. However, I must acknowledge that he sang beautifully in some parts of the concert. "Oceano", "Remember When It Rained", "My December" and "Never Let Go" were great. The setlist was simply the best of all his concerts. Sorry he wasn't able to make it work that evening.$LABEL$0
Don't bother. The reviews I read for this book described it as funny and quirky. It was neither. The book is very short and is made up of essays that average 3 pages long--it doesn't have much meat to it. And I found the essays dense, hard to get through, and most of all, not funny. If you want to read a book of humorous essays, read David Sedaris. If you've already read David Sedaris, read him again. This book is a good one to miss.$LABEL$0
Could be Eastwood's best work to date.... This is not a war film that will be accessible to every viewer, especially those who are only used to soaking up the typical American propaganda war films of the past half century. Of course there are going to be those right winged/ 'wannabe pushovers' who will automatically be persuaded to call out this film as: "rewriting history," when, in reality, they have NO clue/ concept of what actually occurred during this part of history from the POV of the Japanese soldiers, (and still consider any "enemy" to the US as nothing more than "savages.") The fact of the matter is, the film is a true masterpiece of artistic cinema. Many people seem to forget the notion that film = art. "Letters" is NOT a documentary film; it is a filmic portrait of a generally unknown/misunderstood piece of modern history. I would say this subtle masterpiece is Eastwood's best work to date. Though I am sure there are those who would disagree.$LABEL$1

My money could have went a longer ways for me. I have seen parts of every Hellraiser movie, enough to know that Pinhead is a great horror character. I bought this for a few dollars at my local shopette, hoping for good entertainment.

Reducing a horror icon to another sorry teen slasher film character. Don't waste your time.$LABEL$0
blue light special. I had this gift on my wedding registry and we received it shortly after our wedding months after it was purchased in it's original box, etc. With the batteries all in correctly, the item doesn't work at all.

Will write an update on our dealings with the manufacturer.$LABEL$0
Even Robin Hood misses his target once in a while. I'm sad to say that I thought Michael Moore's first stab at fictionalized satire is a far cry from the brilliance of everything else he has produced to date. Perhaps someone who doesn't already share Moore's passion for social and economic justice might find the humor in "Canadian Bacon" less obvious than I, but I saw most of the jokes coming from miles away (or kilometers, in the case of the Canadian segments). If you're looking for political satire that is both dangerous AND funny as hell, check out anything else Moore has done, as well as "Bullworth," "Bob Roberts," and the Citizen Kane of all political satires, "Network."$LABEL$0

Earthbox, 2 plants, 2 tomatoes. I bought one of these. Got advice buying plants from a reputable nursery, followed directions, cared for plants diligently. I planted two tomato plants. Like the other person who scored this a 1, my plants were slow to take off, but grew rather larger. I had two different varieties of tomato. My yield was 1 tomato for each plant and the tomatoes were not very good. Unlike the other 1 rating, I did not have fruit flies. However, I live in a high rise on the 18th floor and box was on the balcony. Box is now in my locker in basement. I had high hopes because the picture on the pamphlet showed many tomatoes and there is nothing like a fresh home-grown tomato.$LABEL$0
Didn't work for long.. I bought a set of these for myself and my husband. Mine lasted about six months before they stopped working.

This is an amazing group with a great new jazz/classical sound. If you are looking for post be-bop and post Bird jazz listen to this group. I heard them live with Lee Konitz a few years ago at the Kennedy Center and they knocked me out - along with the rest of the audience. They have somehow managed to inject classical into jazz in a way that no one else has - maintaining the soulfulness and intimacy of jazz but bringing into jazz some of the beauty of classical structure. You can't dance to their music but you can revel in its originality and beauty. It registers pretty far forward on the frontal lobes. All the musicians in this group are accomplished but listen especially to the minimalist playing style of Florian Weber on piano. I'd like to hear more of this group.$LABEL$1
The ending is an insult to humanity and good taste. FOR SHAME!!!!!!!. Music is great-my favourite modern cycle. Now what in gods name does the end mean. And more than that-it distracts from one of the most glorious musical segments in history with an absurd and meaningless concept that really has no bearing on the rest of the opera(s). It really breaks all rules of good taste and shamefully disctracts the listener and viewer from what they should be feeling as Wagner concludes this epic. I am flabbergasted and appalled that such a crock of sh****T was allowed to ruin this otherwise wonderful production. I recommend the Die Walkure as the best part of this set.The End--a group of people wheel out televisions and sip martinis while a blond boy and girl decide to hold hands.(In this ring--all walsungs have red hair so dont go there) It is even worse than what I have described because I am too upset to go on. FOR SHAME!!!!!!$LABEL$0

The stupid thingy that you can put them in is just retarded and tears and wears(hahah, liked that ryhme did ya?) easily, and it is really stupid. He had trouble doing the kicking and punching actions with this one, benefiting me from not hearing all his noises he makes while playing, but bad for him with the disappointment of such a cruel and posture bad action figure from the 19th century.(or is it the 20th, if you know, i don't aight.)Dragonball Z is kinda stupid anyways.....$LABEL$0

great value. I have tried different kinds of diapers for my baby and these regular Huggies diapers have been the best value for the money of all the diapers out there especially in the bulk cartons. They arrive quickly and shipping is free and it's nice not having to worry about running out of diapers for a while. Other brands do not have the amount of elastic to make them fit snug around baby's bum. The Supreme's do fit much better, but are not as cost effective. The Pampers do keep baby drier, but do not have the elastic to fit snug and therefore leak more than these. These diapers are used day in and day out here and baby rarely has diaper rash. So, overall best value.$LABEL$1
Classic. Phonte? You want more...Nicolay is on the boards and this is the first time I heard him and it was incredible. The beats are so smooth and emotional. It's some real stuff.

Good message, bad instruction. The author has a good message but he doesn't instruct the reader sufficiently to apply his advice. He describes the ideal man but doesn't give enough details on how to become that man.I think the book is decent, but it will be disappointing if you expect instructions on how to be a better man. Instead of instructions on how to be a better man, the author gives you a description of a better man.$LABEL$0

Pure Guitar Pop Gem. CONTEXT: In the middle of the early '90s grunge era, Sweet created 2 of the best pop rock albums of the decade. The production is a bit too squeaky-clean, but the songs are undeniable: they hook you in, and then keep getting better with repeated listens.MUSIC: A surprisingly diverse collection of blues riffs, jangle-pop, psychedelica, and even country sounds. The vocal harmonies are a throwback to the 1960s, but the music never sounds dated or derivative.LYRICS: Beneath the soothing facade are lyrics that express betrayal, heartbreak, and desperation. It's done so subtly that it sometimes gets overlooked.HIGHLIGHTS: I've Been Waiting, Girlfriend, Winona$LABEL$1
An engaging memoir. Elva Trevino Hart has managed an impressive feat with this book. She recounts the depravations of her childhood without making you pity her. She also recounts the small joys she had growing up without giving the impression that these somehow made up for her poverty.It is rare to read a memoir where the author seems like such a real person. Hart's description of her family and history manages to be simultaneously matter-of-fact and deeply personal and emotional. While a northern gringo like me will probably never be able to relate to the experience of a Mexican immigrant family, this book greatly increased my understanding of Mexican-American culture and experience.$LABEL$1
More Lies for ignorant People. Another piece of propaganda disguised as "pro-American." This trash has nothing to do with American values or freedom. It's about silencing and censoring. It's against anyone who questions "Republicans", not people who bash America.

Should be called Baby Wet!. I do not recommend buying these. My son is 15 months and can only wear these about 2-3 hours before the diaper leaks and/or explodes open. The diapers have ripped open multiple times (even when the diaper is not even full) and all the absoprbent gel particles make a huge mess on our carpet. They do not work at night either. My son wakes up every morning drenched. Stay away from these... However, Pampers Cruisers are great!$LABEL$0
He is so much better than this. This is a stand alone novel from Connelly as opposed to his Harry Bosch series.The scenario involves Henry Pierce a computer genius moving into a new apartment and receiving numerous calls from clients of a call girl who previously had this number.From here Henry is dragged into the Los Angeles world of escort services and Internet web sites.The story has some merit but the plotting is ridiculous, which is a shame because Connelly is usually so much better than this.

diappointed. Disappointing movie so I don't know why it won many accolades at the Golden Globes. Russell Crowe is a brilliant actor and his portrayal of a real schizophrenic mathematic genius was good. But Crowe's own seemingly charismatic, virile, and magnetic personality take away some believability. Jennifer Connelley gives a fine performance. Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer play minor characters but nevertheless are pleasure to watch. The guy who plays Nash's roommate "Charles" is entertaining as he did in the "Knights Tale". So I wonder why did this movie fell short of entertaining me? Maybe it took too long to tell a good story.$LABEL$0

A warm pulse for background listening. Neither dubby nor dance-oriented, this release by Dale Lawrence rests comfortably in-between, making for engaging home stereo techno. Theorem knows his production technique, too- this album has clean, rich, and fully developed sounds, a pleasant break from the rougher bedroom programming often heard on solo works.There's the swirling echo of "Debris," the soothing, elongated synth notes of "Embed," countered by a bubbling bassline and popping drums, and the traffic noise with airy beat of "Shift," all enjoyable. "Cinder" and "Fallout" are solid, "Igneous" goes as close to dance sensibility as this album dares, with actual high tones, even. Only "Emerge," the sound of warped bubbles rising to the surface, is a let down.A warm pulse for background listening, an engaging release that doesn't require headphones or a PhD in techno history to appreciate. One of the better techno releases for 1999. B+$LABEL$1

This product stinks! (literally). I decided to try this product because it has a higher DHA & EPA than the other prenatal vitamin I was taking. My doctor said that Omega 3's are the most important since we get so many of the other Omegas in our daily diets. This vitamin seemed like a good choice! Although, I did read some of the other reviews before purchasing and there were others that complained about the same issue.These fish oils reek! I have been taking fish oils for years and have tried many different brands, but these absolutely stink!To my knowledge fish oil supplements should not smell. You think that such an expensive brand as Nordic Naturals would have addressed this problem by now, especially since there have been other complaints!Would NOT recommend!$LABEL$0
More Tedium From Peter Hopkirk. "Reads like a novel" ??? Come on, folks! The yellow pages of any phone book are far more exciting. This text takes a subject of great potential, & reduces it to the dried up dust of a Central Asian desert. I am disgusted with Mr. Hopkirk, because I truely love real History. This author is only one of the sorry crowd who destroy interest in even the most eager seeker. Our schools are full of them.

As a former teacher - & lifelong seeker after the amazing truths of history - I consign Mr. Hopkirk to the dust bin.$LABEL$0

How did this book manage to get in print!. If I could rate this below one star I would. This book covered every stereotype possible: the boozy, trashy, red-headed Irish twins; the big, homely, muscular, Swede; the racist, phony, southern belle; the filthy, rotted-tooth little Frenchman, etc. Of course, the heroine is "chosen" by the most well-respected and good looking brave. The author made sure there was a mate for every one of his characters, there even "happened" to be one Black brave to be paired with the regal, non-conformist, former slave woman.The premise to this novel is original but everything else was so cliche' it was embarrassing.The only part of the book the author seemed to put any effort into were the elaborate, porn-like, sex encounters. I'm no prude but these scenes were thrown in helter-skelter and added nothing to the story line what-so-ever.Don't waste your money or your time on this book.$LABEL$0
Karma ~ Delerium. With this recording the transformation of Delerium was complete. Gone was the heavy sound that was prevelent on recordings such as Stone Tower and in was the easier listening sound of Poem, Chimera and the like. Karma also had the international smash hit silence and I think that it is natural progresion on the part of Delerium. There are so many good tracks on this album and Leeb and Fulber have recorded and produced a true master piece. The book-let is very nice with an amazing cover that fits the mood and style of the album and the vocalists picked to sing the songs are all very accomplished with Sarah McLachlan leading the way with their break through hit Silence.$LABEL$1

A bit of old, and a bit of new. But regardless, Bond is back. This book is a good read. Any fan of James Bond will enjoy Raymond Benson's classic take on 007. He merges the best of Ian Fleming's style, with a bit of John Gardner's plotting, and adding his own take, he creates a good read which is much better both plot-wise and character wise than compared to the last few clunkers from Garnder. Plotting is fairly good, with a few twists and turns along the way. All in all a very good first effort from Benson$LABEL$1

Avoid this book beginner. As an experienced C programmer, I was very disappointed in the lack of attention to detail that the programming examples display. The amount of errors are abundant (out of bounds indexes, case sensitivity, spelling, etc) and MANY of the examples will not compile as written in the book. This book was used in an introductory C# class and I've spent more time debugging the books errors then I could have produced as a complete programming novice. I would pursue an alternative guide to programming in C# if your thinking of purchasing this book, it was definitely rushed for publication with little to no proofreading or editing in my opinion. Details matter in an absolute beginner book.$LABEL$0
Junk, best avoided. The Linksys Wireless-G network looks like a good deal. It isn't. The only value of the thing is to connect you to a wireless network. It doens't do a good job of that.

If you like deep character development, Oscar-winning performances and gripping drama, then look elsewhere.Good Guys Wear Black is an early Chuck Norris as an ex-Special Forces commando left stranded with his unit in Vietnam. About six years later, he's resurfaced in the U.S., but all his comrades are being killed off. It's up to Norris to find out why, before he's next.A little slow for a Norris film, but still a great ton of fun.$LABEL$1

awesome. I read this book in two days. TWO DAYS! Two. Days. I'm a mother of two kids under 4 and babysit an additional baby during the day, and still I stayed up until 2 a.m. the first night reading half the book, and then read the rest between diaper changes, juice boxes, Sesame Street and Harold and the Purple Crayon. It's an awesome book. Wil can write about watching paint dry, and make it sound facinating, but the truth is, the book's plot is impressive on its own. Buy this book, read this book, and for heaven's sake, visit WWdN, where we can all collectively encourage Wil to write book #3.$LABEL$1
A little slow, but then..... The movie takes off and does not let up. I highly recommend this movie to people who enjoy Chinese/martial arts movies. The cinematography is really good and the fight scenes are superb.$LABEL$1

Loved it!. It is a really good book. I love reading Christmas books any way but this one is one that you don't really want to put down. I kept wanting to see what was going to happen next.$LABEL$1
Junk. My kids recieved these for the "family" christmas. Great idea, they had a blast with it, for the day it worked. The things just up and die for no reason. I was there watching my 7yo play with it. No abuse, just quit working. I wouldn't mind paying a few dollars more if the thing just worked longer then a few hours.$LABEL$0
Did not deliver on it's promise. A collection of thoughts about mentoring in the workplace. Mostly common sense, a few "a ha" moments. All in all I wish they backed up the information with more factual data about WHY. They start the book describing how they will distill all of the existing studies and work into this book. While they might have done this they did not get into the WHY or stats as to why this is the right way.An OK skim from the library...not a purchase.$LABEL$0
Great Book!. In a nut shell, this book had everything! It was very detailed, and it was a real page turner. I felt well in tune with the characters, I just couldn't put the book down for one second! I deeply recommend this book to anyone just wanting to get away from everything and enjoy a truly genuine book.$LABEL$1
Don't do it! It's still in beta.... Don't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you, it's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws. Here's what the other reviews (written by Sony employees?) and the literature don't say:* E-marker doesn't seem to work with AOL; you have to not only use another browser, but also set that browser as the default.* When you plug the emarker into your computer, it "automatically" loads your marks into the site...or at least that's what it's supposed to do. On 3 browsers and 2 different computers, I haven't quite gotten this to happen.* Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers' inadequacies, they (over)designed a Flash interface to get your songs that doesn't quite work either. Simple HTML would have been fine, guys....Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0....this is the first time I've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true...$LABEL$0

Tasted strange. The only difference between this Mr. Coffee coffeemaker and the one I bought and returned was mine said 5 cups. It worked perfectly, didn't drip or spill or spit, made 3 1/2 cups of coffee with 5 tbl spoons of coffee to 4 cups water. But it tasted like plastic. I tried 5 times to make coffee that tasted like coffee and never did. Other people had problems with the machine itself, I just couldn't drink the weird tasting stuff that came out of it.$LABEL$0
Highly Recommend It To Anybody. I am now 31, I first had this book read to me in 4th grade, and every several years I re-read it, my copy is so dog-earred. Even though I know it inside and out it still brings me joy, and there are still parts where I cry. I'm planning to buy it for my 9-year-old nephew.$LABEL$1

This book grabs you and DOESN'T LET GO!!!. Once again, another great mystery novel from Mr. Meadows. An engrossing story, with characters that you feel like you know personally.

Nice basic lawn spreader.. This small spreader is perfect for my .27 acre lot. I filled it up once and I was good to go. As with any drop spreader make sure you overlap if anything or you will end up with unfertilized lines in your yard. The large wheels make for an easy push. If you need to fertilize a small yard then get this accurate drop spreader. Make it a point to go organic too, it will prevent a lot of problems with your lawn.$LABEL$1
Movie was a disappointment. I bought an old 2004 used copy of the movie because I love Sophia Myles acting. Based on the director comments comparing it to The Others and Sixth Sense, I was expecting a ghostie or two, but there wasn't even one. I guess the caretaker standing in the yard saying he didn't go to THE WOODS relates to the gardener in The Others, also the little girl saying her stepmother was MAD. Couldn't find anything that reminded me of The Sixth Sense. Too slow moving, too contrived, a lot of the plot didn't really make sense (she had so many opportunities to leave and didn't), none of the acting rang true like you expect in a movie, and of course the ending stinks. I'll donate it to the local library instead of saving it to watch again.$LABEL$0
Bad bad bad .... Wooden acting ... even for Star Trek, CG that would have looked impressive five years ago, awful physics, a miserable targeting system (you're flying fighters btw, not capital ships), and having to do the same "gnat against an armada" mission over and over again without appreciable support from any of the AI ships on your side makes this frustrating at best. Barely even worth renting. I can see why this didn't come out until after christmas. There would have been an awful lot of geeks disappointed at this in their stockings.$LABEL$0
Andrew's Review. I gave the book one star because the book was really boring. It almost put me to sleep. The book takes place in Southern Illinois and it's about a boy named Jethro who wants to go to war during the Civil War. The Jethro's family got tired of hearing about the war and people on horses threatened them. There was very little bloodshed about the war and it got really boring as you got farther into the book. I think it was the worst book I have ever read. There was nothing I liked or great about the book. There was no point and that's why I gave it one star.$LABEL$0
This movie absolutaly sucked. crude and disgusting. It has no redeeming qualities what so ever. If I could give it a negative 5 stars, I would.$LABEL$0
A MUSICAL LADDER TO PEACE AND TRANQUILITY. A wonderful gift of peace and tranquility. I purchased at the time my husband was very ill as I worried he may have a time to linger before leaving for HOME. He enjoyed the music so much however, he didn't "linger" but went straight to the arms of God!$LABEL$1
Great Coffee. I like this coffee maker a lot! I spent a great deal of time searching the reviews and a variety of machines. While I have only used this one machine, I can say I made the right choice! The trick to using a thermal carafe is to pre heat it! Fill it with hot water while you load the coffee grounds basket and pour in the water. Just a minute or two of pre-heating makes a big difference. I find the carafe keeps the coffee warm a good hour or longer. Enjoy!!$LABEL$1

About 1 minute of humor. As hinted in the description and some other reviews, this book is really just about 100 jokes: 1 line questions followed by 1 line answers. To be sold as a book, I had really expected it to have some additional explanation or insight to expand the thought, although the jokes are really easy enough to figure that out on our own. The time to read it is about as fast as you can turn the pages.Granted, some of the jokes are amusing. This book is best used as a gag gift for someone retiring. I like another reviewer's suggestion to use it as a sign-in book. Having purchased as a Kindle book, I can't even use it for that.$LABEL$0
Why did I buy this book?. Weiss is a gloom-and-doom prophet, constantly hissing about why the world and its money is coming to an end.

It just works, but don't use with Panasonic HDAVI. Cable works just fine without the "Monstrous" price tag. I think 6ft. is about as short as you want to go to be able to reach the video source.I found out the hard way that this cable will not work with the ez-sync feature (HDAVI) on the new Panasonic TV's and DVD recorders. I thought all cables followed the same spec, but apparently Panasonic does something different to their cables. You have to go with the RP-CDHG30 or RP-CDHG50 cable in this case.$LABEL$1

Ehn. As another person stated this is a romance novel disguised as a suspense thriller. For that kind of book it's ok, a quick read. I've read much worse of this type. At least I finished it. I just wished they would stop making books like this seem one thing when they are another. But I did really like Pete and Susie, the dolphins. Two stars for the actual two stars.$LABEL$0

Flaws in the script. I really do like Jeremy Renner and wanted to see his early work. However, the story left me asking a lot of questions. Especially concerning Gabrielle Union's character. I won't go into detail because I do not want to give away the plot.All in all it was a good low budget movie.$LABEL$1
No cigar.... The premise was OK, but still it was a downer. It would have been more interesting as a regular science fiction movie. Anyway, you may fall asleep watching this thing.$LABEL$0
outrageous?.. yes..vulgar?.. yes..Absurd?..yes..Entertaining?.. yes... Borat will surely divide its viewers.. it is not intended to be a pc film exploring cultural differences.. it is rather a complete violation of everything pc and brings out the worst in our international relations.. But it is endearing, very funny, and its explorations of the american psyche are spot on.. I found myself more often than not laughing at the American's who confront something different than themselves and bring out the worst stereotypes of Americana.. Borat is one of the most outrageous and totally relevant portrayals of international relations in the history of cinema.. Sacha baron cohen is hilarious in his absurd yet sympathetic portrayal of Borat.. a man completely out of place who always says the wrong things according to the other culture.. I found myself thinking as much as i was laughing..$LABEL$1
National Geographic should be ashamed.. This slap dash compilation of short descriptions was probably put together as a quick way to make a few bucks. The authors are indeed esteemed but I bet each one wrote their part from memory on a Sunday afternoon. The battle descriptions are dry and confusing--most of the maps are useless in determining the sequence of events. Geography seems to be sort of thrown in as a catchy way to snare amateur buffs like myself. I usually read reviews before I buy a book and this time I just "assumed" good quality due to the National Geographic Society imprimatur. Stay away!$LABEL$0

Money thrown down the drain!!!. I received the camera for Christmas and used it twice. After I changed the batteries in it, the camera stopped working. I called Kodak and they said I would have to send it in for repair. After wating for a while without a reply, I called Kodak again to find out what was going on with my camera. They told me that water or some liquid got into it and corroded it and because of that, it would not be covered by the warantee. The camera was never near any water as I only had the opportunity to use it twice. Their customer service is awful and they want $130 to fix the camera. I would rather buy a new one than give them anymore of my money. Stay away from this camera!$LABEL$0
Very Good!. This is one helluva novel. The prologue is the best I think I've ever read anywhere, as far as getting the reader ready for the ride. Everybody loves haunted house stories. This one is a very good one. I liked The Haunting-I know a lot of people like it as well. This is The Haunting with teeth. In this novel, the reader is shown the terrors. Perhaps the bogies might rival Lovecraft. One thing for sure, this writer has not shortchanged anyone in creating this book. I won't be surprised to see a movie made from The Infinite. As for that, I think I'll be surprised if a movie isn't made. What can I say?$LABEL$1

El libro del millón de dólares. Decir que este es el libro del "millón de dólares" puede sonar un poco exagerado, pero es la verdad. Por supuesto que no me refiero al costo del mismo y tampoco a su alto contenido y excelencia literaria, sino a la campaña publicitaria que fue montada al momento de su lanzamiento... La editorial ofreció la cifra de seis ceros a quien sea capaz de demostrar un problema de mas de 250 años: "La Conjetura de Goldbach".El Libro nos embarca junto al "Tío Petros" (un matemático brillante), en la búsqueda desesperada, obstinada y hasta psicótica de la solución del histórico problema.No puedo decir que vayamos a encontrar grandes sorpresas y reveses en la trama, pero es recomendable para el que gusta de las matemáticas, su historia y el enredo psicológico en que se puede caer al enfrentarse a desafíos inalcanzables.$LABEL$1
Some great techniques helped me labor drug-free.... I'm grateful to this book for giving me a couple of excellent relaxation techniques we were able to use during my labor, and for the positive outlook it lends to our increasingly tech-dependent birth system. It's not quite as helpful, thorough or organized as the hypnobabies.com home-study course, but as an introduction to self-hypnosis in birthing, it's valuable. I should stress that your support in the birthing room is the most important thing... everyone attending needs to be in agreement w/ your decision to go natural because a little negativity or doubt can really affect a birthing mother and stall labor.$LABEL$1

The Best Bit was the END. All of the participants in this nonsense are capable of making me split my sides, but none of them did in this movie. By far the best bit was the ending. Unless your brain has been pierced with a tongue stud, you will get much more satisfaction by giving your $$ to a worthy charity, than by spending it on this!By the way although I live in Singapore, I originated from elsewhere, so don't blame Singaporeans for lacking a sense of humour if you disagree with my comments.$LABEL$0
Good Information but lots of out of date "science". I thought some of the information in this book was useful but when I hit page 42 "Clearing Up the Cholesterol Confusion" I was really disappointed. The author is about 20 years out of date as far as research goes and sticks to the AMA party line like glue. There are several completely unsubstantiated claims, such as page 51 "Combined with exercise, calorie intake that matches energy nees and not smoking the G.I. will help you live a long and healthy life". Really? How much longer? The actual GI chart contains a symbol meant to represent food that is "bad" for the heart. I was in agreement through the cakes and cookies but when it appeared in the meat and dairy I knew the author had either not done her homework or did it with a completely closed mind.$LABEL$0
Discontinued. This AT440ML cartridge has been discontinued and is no longer available. The replacement is AT440MLa.

ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS!!!. Nothing but disappointment...1. You can't take stem with blades off - you have to clean it right on the mixer.2. Blades are flat - I can't imagine flat blade to be able to aerate something.2. Very unpowerful - it was fighting soft ice cream and blueberries for 10 min. and still I had pieces in my cocktail.3. After all my cocktail looked like milk with floating blueberries in it, not frothy whatsoever.My KitchenAid food processor did a much better job on these cocktails. I will probably get just a blender for this purpose.$LABEL$0

Only the Grinch would not love this movie!!. The best Christmas tale ever - evident by Ted Turner running it for 24 hours straight the last two Christmases.But don't let that stop you. To see the real story of the Christmas story you need to see this on DVD and all its Red Rider Beebee gun glory.The cast is superb, the tale one all babyboomers will feel is a lot like their childhood. It is fond remembrances, without the overly cutsie pie touches. The kids are real, the emotions are real and funny and the late Jean Sheppard's wit ( and narration) shine in this perfect tale of a boy and his desire for a Red Rider Beebee gun and the lengths he will go to to 'help' Santa remember.I love books, and often when one is made into a movie, I prefer the book. To Kill a Mockingbird is one that I loved in both book form and movie form, and this is the other. Based on several of Sheppard's books, this is a true gem.Every family should have this.$LABEL$1
completly useless!. i'm sorry to say that neither of my two cats have given this product more than a cursory once over since we got it around 10 days ago, nevemind use it for its intended purpose. they are both horizontal scratchers. basically, if its on the floor, its fair game. but not this thing! i tried placing it in their favorate scratching places, rubbed it with regular catnip + even tried Catit Liquid Catnip (see my review for that!) once, my older cat laid down on it + fell asleep like it was a floor level window sill but no action whatsoever since that thrilling performance. what a waste of money!$LABEL$0

The Greatest Live Album Ever!!. This is the loudest, rawest, most savage kick a$$ rock and roll record ever recorded! It never gets the respect it deserves. The only other live album that comes even close is Live at Leeds or maybe No Sleep Till Hammersmith. Before morphing into a radio friendly pop band (The Locomotion), Funk were the heaviest thing going. Nobody could touch them...Zep, Purple, nope. What's really cool is Mel's bass is high in the mix ala Entwistle and it really drives the band. And Mark has a guitar sound like no other mainly due to the Messenger axe going into the West amps. This generation needs to hear this album if they think Green Day is heavy!! Absolutely Essential. My favorite album of all time.$LABEL$1

i waste my money. because I thought it would be much better. It was disappointing, really. I don't understand the good reviews here. 5 o 6 tracks are good enough, including La bamba y Come on Let's go, plus some traditional Mexican tunes, as Carabina 30 30 and Volver, but all the rest is far from been interesting, they bore and ask for skip. My impression is that they could be much more than they really achieve. They've got something (that something that made me buy the album) but they fail and never get to a great thing. I guess the fans will enjoy this collection, but casual listeners: be aware. Prometen más de lo que cumplen$LABEL$0
Great if you don't want to pay for Bose. I've had these for over 5 years and have never had a problem with them. I use them on a daily basis at work to drown out loud co-workers, and also when flying. They don't drown out 100% of background noise, but I can't complain considering the price. Only issue is that the little rubber ear bud covers tend to come off easily and if you happen to lose one and don't have an extra with you, then there's really no fix.$LABEL$1

Everything seems to be missing.. I purchased this power pack for my HP Camera. The first thing I noticed was the lack of instructions in the box. There was NO paperwork included with the product. It also contained to adapter fittings, niether of which listed my camera on thier description - althoug, according to the ... Page, and the Unity Digital page, this is the exact model to use with my camera. (I did try it out after assumiing the battery would need to be charged for 12 hours like most, and tried the fitting that fit the camera. It worked right the first time, and since then it has not been able to take a picture - reads dead battery on the camera.... perhaps if I had instructions on how long to charge it.....) Overall, neat idea. I WILL try another one, but frankly, I was sadly disappointed with what I got.$LABEL$0
EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENTS AND SONGS- good singing!. Superb songs. Linda's singing is good and very emotional enough but it is obvious that she is new to this material. She does not have the interpretive skills of Streisand, Fitzgerald or Holliday.Nelson sounds as good as ever and there is no question that even Frank's ghost is evident in these recordings.$LABEL$1
Not Accurate. I was very disappointed in the movie and stopped watching it midway. This is not an accurate account of St. Rita's life, I would recommend reading on her.At one point in the movie, I thought it was going to get trashy because on her wedding night, there was lots of kissing, sensuality, and then finally they walk off in the other part of the bedroom. This could have been left out of the movie, it did not need to show this, or all the times Paolo has to take his shirt off, and they could have left out the word [...]. This is suppose to be a movie on a saints life.It's already hard finding good family and catholic movies to watch but I'm not going to let me child watch False information that proclaims to be TRUTH. This includes other religious movies.$LABEL$0

This one deserves a minus rating.. I have read all of Kellerman's Peter Decker books and have enjoyed most of them enormously. When I saw this one at the library I immediately checked it out. After plowing through half of it, trying to keep the characters straight and finding them so unpleasant I decided to come and read the reviews and wish I had done so earlier. Thank you to those reviewers who recommend utilizing my reading time on something that would be more enjoyable. I shall not be finishing this book. It will be back in the book drop this P.M. And yes, I agree that Amazon should have a zero stars rating, this one deserves it.$LABEL$0

defective heating element. Some of the reviews on this product are several years old, which may explain why there is so much difference in the ratings of buyers. We have had various waffle makers for 40 years, the last a toastmaster, for about 20 years. Since toastmaster was bought by B&D we thought the quality of a new B&D might be a good choice. Wrong. It has very light plates and the bottom element did not heat evenly. The back half of the bottom waffle was raw dough on three attempts we made to make waffles. I am returning the product and would not purchase another B&D item.$LABEL$0

Pricey, but if you are looking to learn calculus, this is A+. After taking differential calculus, integral calculus, and elementary differential equations, I took a year off of college. Then when I came back, I had forgotten alot of things concerning those courses. Well, I bought this book because it had the most pages and seemed to cover the most information. Well, it was a good buy! It covered ALL of the material that I had covered in those 3 previous courses. It was a great book for refreshing my memory. This would also be a great book for learning calc for the first time also.$LABEL$1
A must see!. Harry Chapin's finest work was writing the songs for this rollicking musical introduction to the modern day gospel of Luke, telling of the birth of Jesus in the great state of Georgia.Tom Key changes from one delightful character to another with ease. The quartet of musicians supporting him were brilliant on their instruments as well as fine actors, often comedic. "Spitball Me, Lord, Over the Home Plate of Life" is one funny song!)You will laugh, cry, and gasp as you see the Gospel through new eyes. Enjoy! Share it with everyone who will sit and listen.$LABEL$1
Not bad at all.... I was not really sure how this movie was going to play, but it is a thriller and it did keep me on the edge of my seat --- I would probably even watch it a second time --- that's saying a lot for me.BUT, do yourself a favor and buy it used on amazon marketplace or rent it...$LABEL$1

A Nearly Perfect Album From A Nearly Perfect Songwriter. Neil Finn comes closer to perfection in his craft then nearly anyone writing music today. When he is on, he is DEAD ON. Penning lovely melodies with lyrical content to match. This, his first solo effort, is a collection of his latest gems and with it he reminds us of why his fans love him. It also, however, nudges some to wonder what he does with all the rocking stuff he writes, as this album only comes close to moving your feet once (My Loose Tongue). As far as I'm concerned, that's more than enough as this is close enough to perfection for me. Keep 'em coming Neil.$LABEL$1
High pitched whine, defective design. Don't buy one of these until they fix what must be a design flaw. As others have noted, there is a high pitched whine audible whenever the box is switched on. It's there regardless of whether any music is playing or not. This is almost certainly a design flaw. It could be aliasing noise, a leaky carrier tone, etc.XM is an interesting concept, but this boombox is poorly implemented.$LABEL$0
The Wolf Master. Well being that I'm from a rather rough part of Wisconsin. My gang resides in the grimiest trailer park eva. Before heaven sent us the amazing tshirt. My gang was the 11th most rowdy gang in the trailer park. Since then we jumped straight up to number 2. Being that the number one gang actually has real wolfs named Kito and Keloy that they raised since baby wolfs. Tshirts is second best.Be aware of knock offs. To ensure authenticity the shirt should fade to grey in just 1 wash! I don't know why they just didn't make the shirt in grey like wolfs colors. To get maximum dudage I recommend cutting off the sleeves, don't worry the value of the shirt will not go down by doing this, but is will increase your Poon level. [...] I even had this one 11 year olds father give me and his daughter tickets to a Miley Sirus concert in trade to wear my 3 wolfs t shirt for the night. [...] Oh well, I got to see Miley!$LABEL$1
The worst book I have ever read. Having a Minor in Lit, I have read lots of books. Having purchased many, many books, I have never felt the desire to write a scathing review of a book. I HATED this book.If you HATE animals or get some weird enjoyment over the gross abuse of animals this is the book for you. Once that part of the book began to develop, I really could care less about why this woman killed herself. I could go on and on but this book is not worth the effort.$LABEL$0
OLD KINGDOM PROVINCIAL EGYPT ANALYSED. If you are lucky to find this title and you are not a beginner in Egyptologial matters, this is a very attractive essay on the provincial administration and possible causes for the fall of the Old Kingdom. Very thought-provking issues are put forward all along the book, and it must be regarded as an important contribution to the understanding of the historical period it covers.$LABEL$1
Jim Morrison ....buried again...by Bruce Botnick. I am wondering who let John Densmore mix these tracks? Morrison's vocals are almost left off...they are so reduced in this new mix...just horrible..and the drums are now the lead instrument...just awful. A wonderful selection of tracks...reMASTERING would be great but reMixed? WHY? and if so..why didn't anybody mention that Jim's voice was the defining instrument of the band...when he died...so did the band. Don't get me wrong I admire Robby and Ray...but without Jim they didn't go anywhere and why he is diminished in these new mixes is just a crime.$LABEL$0
A bit unrealistic but good. Very quick reading, I was 3/4 of the way through and felt I had just started reading it. Tim LaHaye always does a great job of developing characters and situations. This story was based on actual heart breaking events that take place today. I mention unrealistic because of how it all works out but realize that God is able to do all things. I loved the twist at the end of the book. Overall, good Christian fictional reading.$LABEL$1

cute but poorly made. Aesthetically, this umbrella is just fine, and still looks good after 3 months of use so far. My problems with it: 1) The picture makes it look like a base comes with it. Nope- you have to purchase one separately, and there's no guidance on which type to get. Don't get the Verdi Gras cast iron stand, this umbrella is too thin to fit properly into it. So it leans a bit to the left. Not a huge deal.2) Whenever I crank it closed, it somehow manages to pinch and cut my hand, even if I'm trying to be careful3) If you're dumb enough, like me, to leave it open on a windy day, it blows over, taking your table and umbrella stand with it.$LABEL$0
If you love being bored to death.... ...then this book is for you. I can't believe I wasted hours of my life on a book where nothing happens.

Who believes this stuff? The ones who want to.... What I find more frightening than someone who says what she says is that how much publicity is made from it.I mean, sure people can believe what she says but she goes ahead and condemns the First Amendment? Uhm...isn't that kinda going against the right for her to say what she...uhm..thinks?And going up against the 911 widows? Poor taste. But it sells.Basically she is the Maryln Manson of the Conservative nutjobs. Saying just enough to cause a frenzy to get her book bought and for her to become rich without changing a damned thing.Any Carney would be proud$LABEL$0
Spot on Promise. Everett does an outstanding job in providing both sound biblical and financial truths. In today's (literally this very day - 10/24/08) chaotic financial arena, it's great to have a perspective of God's unchanging financial principles.

Wrong Impression. When the uncut version was shown on television a few months ago,they advertised the video would be the same as the uncut version shown on television. I played the first video and it is the same as the original movie without the uncut scenes. This is truly one of my favorite movies and when I saw it on television with the never before scenes, I couldnt wait to get that version on video. If I had known this, I wouldnt have bought the Anniversary Edition.$LABEL$0
Best Rush Album Yet. This is my second review. My first one was over 8 months ago. I just want to say that Vapor Trails has become my favorite Rush album (which by default makes it my favorite album). It would have been inconceivable to me that Rush could do better than Moving Pictures, Hemispheres or Fairwell to Kings. Hold Your Fire was the the last really great Rush album for me (although I do like all the ones that followed except maybe Presto). Vapor Trails has turned it all around again. I just hope they keep releasing albums. Anyone that can't hear the genius in this album just hasn't given it a chance. Play the full album 10 times and then decide.$LABEL$1
Poor quality and cut by about 7 minutes. This release is most likely mastered from VHS, it looks washed out and is not very sharp. Also the film runs 86:26 NTSC. The british DVD, issued under the title "Dragon Warrior" by Pegasus runs 93.42 PAL. The picture quality on the british release is also not perfect though.$LABEL$0
this is a great book. I am buying this book after lending out my original copy to new dog owners so many times that I finally lost it. This is a very clear, concise dog training book. It's one of the best you can get, especially if you don't have the patience to read an entire long book. I love Carol Lea Benjamin's other training books also (How to Survive Your Dog's Adolescence is amazing), but this one is great, too, and a little more of a quick read.$LABEL$1
Worth the Read, for Beginners Too. Although Joan won an Olympic medal and I've only run two 5k races, I found this book to be very useful and informative. Some of the training drills are new to me, most actually, and I plan on using them. She also has a training schedule for everything from your first 10k to your first marathon. The book even touches on 5k races and the mile. I don't know that I'll ever want to train for a marathon, but the book was interesting and inspiring, with Joan's personal experiences mixed in with experts's advice on everything from stretching to buying the right bra.$LABEL$1
Not worth it. I originally bought this because I have an older ipod which had poor battery life, however this player was not worth the money. I bought it because it was one of the few smaller players that was compatible with mac, but many times when I transfer the songs from my computer to the player they do not transfer. This can be very frustrating, and takes up a lot of unnecessary time.$LABEL$0

PHENOMENAL!. The Who, my personal favorite band, in one of their greatest albums. Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend are currently touring this album (as of Jan. 2013) and I highly suggest seeing it! But there's nothing like listening to the talents of Moon and Entwistle, who are unfortunately no longer with us. This album is a perfect example of why everyone should listen to The Who!"Is it me, for a moment?"$LABEL$1
ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!. As a fan of the original series, I never once planned to see this film. Not for the poor casting (the only one who resembled anyone from the original was the General Lee), the rehashed plot, or the fact that Hollywood has taken a once good and decent show and added alot of sex and profanity to it, but for the simple fact that Jessica Simpson should never be allowed in front of a movie camera. Joe Simpson, if you're reading this review, please stop bombarding your idiot daughter upon our society!!!$LABEL$0
Bought 2, both are broken within a week. My dog's barking seemed to decrease within a few uses of this product, that's why after the first one broke after only a week I ordered a replacement. The first one sprayed the Citronella as soon as it was refilled, even when on the off button, and the second one we used for one day, I went to refill it, and nothing happened when I blew on it to test it. I exchanged the battery just in case, used a different refill bottle, and nothing! One week for the first, 1 day for the second!!!!! Our dog is a 2.5 lb Maltese kept inside, so it's not excessive wear or water damage. Poor quality! Great potential!$LABEL$0

Great for this Breastfeeding Mother. I love this sterilizer. I am a breastfeeding mother and use the Avent Isis to pump milk from time to time. This sterilizer fits the Isis perfectly along with a few bottles, nipples and sealing discs. I wash my bottles out after I use them and put them away. When I'm ready to pump, I load this up and 7 minutes later I'm good to go. You don't need to dry the bottles or pump before using, if you use them right away. When I'm done, I wash my pump and store it back in here to dry. It stays there until I'm ready to use it again. I've never tried sterilizing any other bottles but the instructions specify how to place others in here so they fit well. It is very time saving, rinses easily, and works very well. I'm glad I've never had to resort to the boiled water on the stove.$LABEL$1
Carol is that great singer, we have been looking for. Carol Sloane really knows how to sing JAZZ. She seems to be a natural at this venue. Her voice is really smooth and nice to listen to.For this project Carol used Bill Charlap as pianist and arranger. I must say Bill did a good job wearing both hats. Also Carol has a lot of fine sidemen that contributed to this cd. I think we need to give the musicians for this project a hand of applause.The down side to this cd was that some of the arrangements I didn't like and feel that they worked very well. All and all I would say this was a worth while cd.Recommendation: I would like to recommend this cd.$LABEL$0
I've been guzzling this stuff for years, excellent tasting shakes with good blend of essentials. Does it taste like a great milkshake? No, but it is very good. I usually mix it with 8oz milk, about 3oz water and 3oz ice. It makes a more liquidy shake that is much easier to drink. I think the recommended mixture makes it a bit too thick. Taste is a good vanilla flavor and there is very little aftertaste other than the sweetener used. Its definitely filling and works well post workout.$LABEL$1
Be careful of hardware conflict. I have bought this product 6 months back. But I found it really difficult to install it on my PC. Picture freezes after 5 minutes. That's it!

Picture quality is really great!.$LABEL$0
The Last Fairy Tale of Fantasy from the Vietnam War. This well written, but poorly researched fantasy piece should have been labeled as a novel in my opinion. Ten POWS died of starvation, mistreatment, and torture in Garwood's camp; none of them crossed over to the enemy. To know the real Bobby Garwood, read Frank Anton's "Why Didn't You Get Me Out?" or Zalin Grant's "Survivors," plus several more POW narratives that are out of print but still may be found at major libraries. If you are still inclined to believe the best in Garwood, look up his name or "Garwood Papers" on the POW/MIA Database on the Library of Congress's website, and you'll discover a ton of material that will change your mind$LABEL$0
Spyros bad. I dont recommend this game at all, the graphics are nice at first but get boring, the game flat out sucks, the only reason i even gave it two stars is because i know how long it takes to make a game, and i of 14 couldnt even figure the damnb this out, its confusing as hell, and i didnt even want to play it because nothing drew me to it.$LABEL$0
Scratch and Sniff. One of the only enlighting things I found out about this Manga was it has a 'scratch and sniff' cover, which smells like Strawberry Shortcake (which smells so yummy!) but the overall story and art is it's downfall. I read about 20 pages and got bored, so I'm selling it online. There is no depth to the characters and no real engaging plot. There is only some Slash and Shonen Ai parts for fans, but it won't satisfy a Yaoi Fan. I suggest looking out for Cafe Kichijouji.$LABEL$0
Refreshingly different.. I'm not a big romance reader. But this book caught my eye and something told me to give it a chance.I'm glad I did. It truly was a memorable story. The most striking part of it all to me was the starkly poignant way the author tackled the issue of human-reliance. She showed how dangerous it is to rely on a mere person for your happiness. People always fail people. We were made to love each other, not to hang on each other. No one is strong enough to carry both their issues and your issues on their shoulders, no matter how sure they may be of the otherwise.Yup... a pretty neat story... and a potentially life-saving lesson.$LABEL$1
A Mystery Buffs Dream Weekend. This is a tribute to Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler, all rolled into one neat murder mystery. Bernie and Carolyn spend the weekend in a New England guesthouse, which attempts to replicate an authentic old English manor. When guests begin showing up murdered, it's Bernie who plays the part of Hercule Poirot or, if you like, Philip Marlowe, as he gathers the clues, which will hopefully lead him to the murderer before too many more guests are knocked off. Being a guesthouse, there are suspects aplenty delivering us ample opportunity to figure out the mystery ourselves. If mystery fans will be delighted by this book, then fans of the British crime story will be even more so. Combining the wit and humour of Lawrence Block with the traditional murder mystery creates a deadly weekend, though presented in a light and breezy manner.$LABEL$1
YET ANOTHER GREAT METAL BAND GONE SOFT. Ok don't get me wrong i love SEVENDUST and there is nothing wrong with mellow metal BUT!!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot wait until a group will come out and not change their music style. i'm so sick of these bands drawing fans in with one type of music then going soft hmm hmm(creed,staind) just to name a couple others. I guess not all bands can be like OVERKILL who will never change their style for anything. I call it going from great to mediocre but then again the world is ruled by mediocracy uh? But anyway if you are a big SEVENDUST fan pick it up. If your a "rock" fan pick it up. If your a true to life metal fan (OVERKILL, TESTAMENT, SLAYER, JUDAS PRIEST) stay clear!!!!!!!!$LABEL$0
Superficial attempt at wit. Excited to read a book from an under-represented member of the "Beat Generation", I plowed into The Dud Avacado with relish.... and was sorely disappointed. Unlike contemporary Kerouac's On the Road, The Dud Avocado sadly lacks spiritual, moral, or intellectual development. The primary character starts out as superficial, vain, and unbelievably gullible. Unfortunately, though she miraculously scrapes through disasters of her own creation, she never grows as a person.I too was twenty once and I too did many stupid things. But, I'm really not interested in reading about somebody else's ignorance. Stupid is as stupid does.$LABEL$0
Couldn't finish it. I read every day, so does my 8 year old, and we often read to each other. 10 pages into me reading this one, and we looked each other in the eye and made faces. I can't remember the last time we didn't finish a book. Too many long streams of colors matched with birds we hadn't heard of (and we have almost memorized David Attenborough's Life of Birds, and my son does a couple dozen bird calls from those videos). The illustrations were nice drawings, but honestly, the rain forest is best taught with a visual component. Or perhaps with much better writing.$LABEL$0
DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! WASTE OF MONEY!. This book was the biggest waste of money! It was all about poor Gerry Starrett and her poor psycho son, who kidnapped and raped several girls, even murdering one. And oh how horrible his life in prison was. Not one word about the victims and their families. This book is very one-sided. I can't believe a family would even have the gall to write a book in defense of a murderous son.$LABEL$0

Bad, very very bad. This book is terrible. Don't waste you money. Never having seen such a poorly written, self promoting text, I took it upon myself to look further into the matter.Basically, the book is a pitch for the authors so called patented FQPSK. Upon further investigation, I discovered that an entity called "digcom" licenses fqpsk. The web site, ..., list a cartel of sorts that leads one to believe that many major companies are embracing fqpsk as a standard. I contacted a couple of the companies listed and talked to the VP's of engineering. They all had nothing good to say, and were suprised that digcom still listed them as part of the fqpsk consortium. Basically, they had given up on fqpsk and pulled out of the consortium.$LABEL$0
Great stand, strong enough for our windy days. This is a very heavy, durable umbrella stand. However, reading the reviews, I was prepared that it wouldn't exactly fit our smaller umbrella. It did not. We had to "fatten" our umbrella handle up a bit to make a tight fit, and after we did, it's great. We have very windy days here and the porch it is on is in direct line of the high winds. So far, it's really holding up. We've had it all summer. I'm pleased with the fact that when we move it, there is no rust spot under it. I recommend this base especially if you use a larger umbrella.

A Gimmick. This book is completely devoid of any substance.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!. Like most of you I'm an avid movie fan. This is not a movie so much as it's a 2 hour nap put on film. For the love of God watch anything, and I do mean anything, other that this garbage. Primate looses girl to evil other primative, primate rescues girl. CAN YOU JUST FEEL THE EXCITEMENT!Forget the fact that this film has all the historical accuracy of the Flintstones, (or Kansas public schools), the movie leaves you asking the question, "I spent 2 hours doing what?!"Honestly, save your time and your money. Just take a nap, same effect but you save some money and your dreams will almost certainly be FAR more entertaining.$LABEL$0
wasted potential. The beginning of the book was quite engrossing, but the plot kept wandering all over the place. When the story suddenly, and unexpectedly, started talking about some super-intelligent squid, I quit. Any interest I had in continuing the book was gone.$LABEL$0
Good story overcomes perceived flaws. For sheer escapist adventure of the romantic variety, this book is a winner. There's quite a bit of anachronism in dialogue and character behavior, and those who are familiar with Spanish may be put off by abysmal usage of that language (misspellings like "buenas dias" and "bandeleros" stand out -- repeatedly). Horsey terms, too, take an occasional hit ("gruello"?). Some of the plot points require extreme suspension of disbelief. The story is so delightfully told, though, that I was more than willing to suspend my internal editor and just read for the fun of it.$LABEL$1

Preaching to the Choir: Anti-Mormonism for Evangelicals. I downloaded this because it was free. From the title, I knew it was an expose of Mormonism. It is, but only as contrasted to the author's original Christian faith. As a secularist, I found nothing shocking about the mainstream Mormon church--just some weird Masonic-like stuff and self-important old men. The author seems to have joined for the social aspects and then quit when it turned out to be hard. I slogged through the first half. The second half, which describes the author's ministry, I skimmed. This book obviously appeals to those who share Ms. Robertson's beliefs, but just seemed like propaganda to me.$LABEL$0
Complete scam. Zero stars. Out of the box I set this on a six foot range and walked around with the collar in hand. Nothing. Walked closer. Nothing. I had to literally sit the collar down next to the unit to get it to beep. Whether I had it set on 2 feet or 12, same results. I even made sure it was not sitting next to any large metal objects. Shame on you Amazon for selling something that is a complete ripoff.$LABEL$0

Kidz Bop ALWAYS [0 stars]. not worth any price, if you want to buy this cause you like the music, then BUY it from the person who actaully sang the song in the first place, and that would probably sound SO much better than some nine year old kids singing it instead. i don't wanna hear kids singing it? do you? it's so annoying. dont buy this, please just don't buy it, anything else is BETTER than this. it really is just a big kick in the face to the music world. appreciate the people who did it in the first place, instead of some young kids, who have no idea what any of lyrics mean.$LABEL$0

i want to tell you my feelings about this book.... This book is really good reading! I think almost everyone can relate to the feeling of wanting to express your emotions and feeling like the person you are speaking to either doesn't understnad or doesn't care.

Great for destressing students. I am a guidance counselor in a middle school and have a number of "toys" to distract the children when they come to my office and help them unwind a bit. Some enjoy this puzzle by just building their own creations and others enjoy the challenge of completing one of the puzzles on the cards. This is easily one of their favorites and has stayed on my table the longest as there are so many possibilities and it lends itself well to their creativity as each of the pieces is completely different from the rest. The students really enjoy it and it makes their visits more enjoyable.$LABEL$1

Although, I could definitely see how a motor would simplify matters, we still went through it in less than an hour (which includes cleaning it up post-grinding, and taking care of our cranky children). I would recommend this to others. This one hasn't been as impressive as some motored ones I have been around, but it did the job efficiently, was easy to clean, and didn't get my kitchen messy with "goo" everywhere. You will want a workbench or something similar to bolt it down on.- One complaint, the packaging we received the grinder in was horrible. I am almost surprised we even got it because of the box being in such bad shape. Also, no manual included and the handle didn't survive the transit, so my husband had to make one. These aren't devastating factors, but are annoying.$LABEL$1
Could be a good book... just don't try to do the practice problems.. Why the $%&* would you list a homework problem under section 4.4 when you wouldn't know how to do it without reading section 4.5? This has thrown off my whole study strategy that has served me extremely well in every science class (physics, math, chemistry) I've taken up to this point, college or high school. Basically, you read a section, and then do the practice problems for that section BEFORE moving onto the next. I just wasted 2 hours of valuable finals study time reading sections 1.1 through 4.4 looking for the solution, only to turn 2 pages ahead after giving up to find the necessary information right there... words cannot express how enraged I was after discovering this and I hope this review will save some others from lighting their book on fire and throwing it out the window like I almost just did.$LABEL$0
Great Conversation Piece. This book is a great way to pass the time and a must for any aviation nut. Obviously it can't go into great depth on every power flying vehicle ever produced, but it does an outstanding job of hitting all the high points.$LABEL$1

call of the wild. I had always heard of this book since I was only a kid, but never read it until last month, and to be totally honest, the only reason I read it was because it was a free book. But I gotta say within the first few pages I really got into it, and absolutely loved it. It was a very good book to read as I went to bed each night.The Call of the Wild$LABEL$1
Not OK. For the price; not worth it. The product is great accept that I can't find replacement bulbs for it so it makes it a one time use and thats not worth it.$LABEL$0
In flight confusion. This is by far the worst language-related product I have ever purchased. This CD assumes that you can learn a language by memorizing long, complicated phrases by rote with no foundation whatsoever in vocabulary or grammar. It is just not possible to remember long setences relating to travel without first learning anything about the basic grammar of a language. The phrases aren't even repeated or broken down. This CD might be useful if you have already taken some modern Greek and want to brush up on travel phrases. Otherwise save your money -- most Greeks who work in airports and hotels speak English and this CD won't help you have much of a conversation with anyone who doesn't.$LABEL$0
enjoy ... while they last. I can't argue with the sound quality (although you definitely hear contact with the wire -- probably unavoidable with a light-weight wire).More troubling is that they simply don't survive normal use. The wire is too light-weight & didn't last even a year before one ear starting cutting out. I nearly always placed the headphones back in their carrying case after use. They're simply too delicate to be this expensive.$LABEL$0

Very disappointed in KS. I am halfway through this book and not enjoying it as I have all of her others I have read. I decided to look on Amazon to see what any other comments were about this book. I looked, and have decided to give up on this one and continue on to another one of hers. I just found this one very hard to follow and I don't like having to work that hard trying to keep up with a story line. My sister-in-law, who is also an avid reader, once told me that if you're not "into" a book by page 100, it may not be worth the effort to continue.$LABEL$0
Foam roller is amazing!. Bought this for my dad for christmas! He has back issues and loves to use this to work out. It also works well for yoga and Pilates. It is very durable, I would recommend this product to anyone.$LABEL$1
A knife is of no use if...... I will just echo much of what "The Shepard" said about the knife. It's almost impossible to remove it from the sheath without playing tug of war with yourself. And to make a strange situation even more strange, the belt/boot clip that is an integral part of the sheath is so weak that it is useless for holding the knife in any location.....which is why I no longer own this knife. Rideing my motorcycle today, the knife fell away somewhere on I40. I don't miss it....Lynn Stubblefield$LABEL$0
Cyber Acoustics... Stereo Headphones. It is good one, but I confused with the one that may have a bit louder sound than this one. Anyway, for moderate use its OK...$LABEL$1

This season is the worst one so far.. I have watched this show since the beginning and this is by far the worst one so far. If they wanted to kill Jim off they should have just killed him and let him cross over. I have not watched anymore of this season since he took over that guys body.$LABEL$0
No mention of Wicca in product description - why?. Why doesn't Amazon mention that this video talks about Wicca in their reviewor in their product description? I also looked at the video in a store, and there was no mention of Wicca on the case. That's important information to leave out. If it were there, consumers could decide for themselves whether or not it was an appropriate video to show their children.$LABEL$0

EXCEPTIONAL SCENT!!!!!. OH MY GOD THIS STUFF IS AWSOME!!!!! IT SMELLS LIKE COCO. WHEN I LOOK ON THE REVIEWS, I LOOK FOR WHAT SOMEONE SAYS IT SMELLS LIKE BECAUSE ALOT OF THE TIME I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IM BUYING. IM SUCH A PERFUME JUNKIE THAT I BUY TONS OF IT A YEAR. SO THANK YOU TO THOSE WHO TAKE THE TIME TO TELL ME WHAT SOMETHING SMELLS LIKE! I JUST RECIEVED MY SCENT TODAY AND ALREADY HAVE RECIEVED A COMPLIMENT ON THE SCENT. THIS STUFF IS WONDERFUL!!! EVERY WOMAN WILL LOVE THIS AND ITS CHEAP TOO. HAPPY SCENT TRAIL TO YOU ALL.$LABEL$1
A resource to be treasured. If we're lucky enough not to have a chronic disease with difficult symptoms, P.S. Julia is an interesting, moving, humorous read, and a resource to share with those who are struggling with such a condition. If one has been challenged by such a condition, the book is way beyond an interesting intellectual read, as it has the power to produce or strengthen commitment, hope, belief in taking a more positive and ultimately healing way of addressing what has happened to ones body.$LABEL$1
**Yawn**. Rented this on CD as a part of a long road trip. While giving SOME new insight, this is more like a summary of boxscores turned into a book. I was expecting MUCH more from this...instead, I got hours dedicated to 2 games and minutes dedicated to the other 98 years mentioned in the title.$LABEL$0
I didn't want an apple taco.... I generally love these Sunbelt products. They are tasty and healthy and that is a wonderful combination. Sadly, these bars have a distinct taste that is off-putting and really makes them less than wonderful in my eyes. The outer shell smells and tastes like a wheat tortilla. I'm not joking. The center is wonderfully apple like and the cinnamon flavor is apparent, but the initial taste one has when placing this in their mouth is not pleasant.$LABEL$0
Very disappointed!!! ;(. I'm very disappointed because I NEVER got my movie that I bought like 5 months ago, so what is up with that? Paid for it, but....oh well!!!$LABEL$0
Errors, Errors, Errors.... This book has too many errors. There is nothing more frustrating than to follow the steps outlined and find out it does not work because they did not Q&A; the examples.ie. They ask you to select a field from the table, but the field does not exist. The stored procedure does not include it.You would have to know how to write SQL to correct this.$LABEL$0
stopped working. Had this thing for a month and noticed it started turning my appliance on and off at different times after three weeks. I attempted to reset it but the display is missing elements in and i cannot see the days of the week i want to set. I have contacted the company for a return because no return info came with the unit.$LABEL$0
It sounded so good on the back cover.... I first read this book over three years ago and didn't like it. But then, a few weeks ago, I decided to see how much my taste in books had matured and gave it another chance. Big mistake! I hate this book! They took a wonderful concept and blew it to smithereens by ruining Giles and Xander. I would have felt better if they'd somehow discovered that the real Giles and Xander had been locked in a warehouse for the duration of this novel and had been replaced by cyborgs because only that could explain why the heck they were saying such stupid stuff!Not only were they horrible, but the supposed climax of the novel - the zombie diner fight scene - was over waaay too fast and easily. It completely and irreparably damaged my spirit. The books only saving grace was some fun quips from the Buffster and a sweet (albeit, paranormal) kiss between Willow and Xander at the very end. I would recommend Coyote Moon and Halloween Rain in a heartbeat over this book.$LABEL$0
Lives up to all the hype.. This DVD is the not only the best JM dvd it's the best exercise dvd I have over all, and I have them all. Insanity, p90x etc. Jillian's is just as challenging, less repetitive, more explanatory, offers the meal plan as well. For $12 you can't beat the value. It's all been said in previous reviews, but this workout is amazing. If you purchase it you won't be sorry.$LABEL$1
Buy, Capitalist!. With most bands, you only get one version of a specific song. Occasionally, extended mixes, remixes, live or demos show up. The reason I mention this, as is readily apparent if you've read anything on this...is that these are re-recorded studio versions. Excellent...and now we have two studio versions of these tunes. Considering the price, well worth it!$LABEL$1
This is Manson's best album yet!. This is Manson's best album yet. Unlike Antichrist Superstar he sings about things that affect all of us. He constantly is reminding us that drugs do run our society. "The Dope Show" is the best song on the album. But the others are not far behind. In his past albums Manson constantly screamed his lyrics. This happens only a few times in "Mechanical Animals". I particulary like the song that has a 70's sound and backup singers. If you are looking for variety from one artist, Marilyn Manson is your man? woman? mannequin? Who knows and who cares!$LABEL$1
Very Poor Quality. When we took the rails, etc., out of the box, the rails were split from top to bottom; not structurally sound at all. When I called the manufacturer about this, he told me that it was "the nature of the wood" to crack and split. Give me a break. Save yourself some time and trouble and look elsewhere for a swing.$LABEL$0
too vague. This book lead to more questions than answers, and the author comes across as very "superior". There is a much better book out "The Donkey Companion" by Sue Weaver that also includes information about miniatures. If you can only afford one book, get the Donkey Companion. This is so vague and leaves you guessing or assumes you know equine basics, barely touches on husbandry, care, training or temperment, and then there are the capitalized words "yelling" as if you were a fourth grader. Wasted my time. and money.$LABEL$0
A decent anime series...but the real gem is the soundtrack. Brain Powered is an okay animated series with some strange turns of plot (it seems a matter of course that mecha appear in the series - though it doesn't make too much sense :P). It certianly isn't a Marcoss or Gundam ripoff, but it isn't entirly successful in shaking off the giant robots wars so common in anime.The soundtrack is really good, its been done none other than the famed, Yoko Kanno. Kanno really hits another one out of the park with this one.$LABEL$1
rating update. Ordered them on July 19th they were in stock and on sale.I was supposed to recieve them in mid August.Then on August 29th I got an email saying the shipping was delayed and I had to confirm that I still wanted them.I did and the new shipping date is November 9th.Seems like a long time to ship an in stock item.REVIEW UPDATE:Item still shows in stock .They cancelled my order saying it is unavailable from their source.I believe it has something to do with the sale price I ordered it at has now tripled and they didn't want to honor the old price.I,ve bought a lot of things from amazon with good luck but this has left a very sour taste in my mouth about doing further buisiness wiyh them.$LABEL$0
A wall of sound to knock you to your knees. Cop Shoot Cop's second release on Big Cat records yields more of the same style as Consumer Revolt. Rythmic and driving arrangements that swell into blistering choruses. The songs on this album are even arranged in such a dramatic way that it is hard to stop the album once you start it. Each song becomes a prelude to the next in a fashion that almost plots out a twisted and spiraling story of loss, contempt and despairity with a smart and cynically sharp hatred toward just about everything. Imagine Tom Waits crossed with Einsturzende Neubauten.It will leave you unsatisfied, you just can't get enough.$LABEL$1
Super Sexy. Let's be honest here. You buy this product for one reason only; to see your baby in it for 5 minutes before you strip it from her and have some fun.This product worked, it looks fabulous on her body, it really frames her buns perfectly and her DDs look fantastic in it as well. She managed to keep it on her body for 30 minutes...I was tied up!You will love this body stocking.$LABEL$1
A dazzling debut. The short stories in this impressive debut collection are populated with characters who will stay with you long after you've finished reading. From the comic book artist obsessed with a lost love in "Have You Seen Her" to the title character in "Mr. Lillicrop's Shining Moment" -- the most dignified drunk you'll ever meet -- the people of Kulpa's fiction find hope while dancing on the edge of hopelessness. My favorite story in the collection, "The Night Copernicus Died," is a surreal, lyrical meditation on redemption.$LABEL$1
Lugubrious..... A very unsatisfying book with a very interesting setting. The portrait of the immediate aftermath of WW2 in Berlin is excellent but the story is drawn out much longer than necessary. The writing is OK but the characters are unappealing, especially the main character, whose joylessness is monotonic in the extreme. You don't expect a story set in war-devastated Berlin to be a boffo laff riot but you can expect some spirit, some elan and energy.$LABEL$0
A dull primer on nonduality. If you've seen "What the [bleep]" and found it revelatory, you might find this book moderately useful/interesting.Otherwise, particularly if you've ever read any book about Eastern philosophy/spirituality, you're liable to find this a painfully dull, repetitive, dry, and uninformative read.I can sum it up as follows: "Aristotle - bad! Nagarjuna - good! Non-duality, token reference to Buddha/Jesus/Eastern mystic, unintentionally reductionistic reference to quantum physics or psychic research, blah blah blah, endnote."The authors are presumably quite nice people and I hope my viewpoint doesn't cause them any unnecessary suffering...but they should really stick to academia rather than mainstream publication.$LABEL$0
profound and powerful--don't miss it!. A SIDEWAYS LOOK AT TIME is a gem of a book. Jay Griffiths combines the wisdom and humility of Ivan Illich, the anger at social injustice and word magic of Eduardo Galeano, the senstivity and compassion of Terry Tempest Williams and the sense of wonder of John Muir into a text that challenges the time and productivity obsessed world of consumer society. Take time to read this book; its depth, and Griffiths' erudition, sharp wit and incisive social critism can't be fully appreciated by skimming it. As the book makes clear, the road to (social and ecological) hell is paved with "time-saving" devices and the worldview that "time is money." Perhaps this book will eventually be seen as a manifesto for the growing "slow life movement" now taking root around the world. Even when I disagreed with Griffiths, which wasn't often, the power of her prose and her arguments forced me to think hard about my own views. You can't ask for more from a book.$LABEL$1
awesome!!!!. What a hit on Christmas morning.y Grandsons loved it! They are BIG Thomas fans. It will fit with all of their tracks. What'seven better ...it was $10 cheaper than at Toys R Us!!!!$LABEL$1
Comprehensive View. As in her book on Instinctual Subtypes, Ms. Chernick-Fauvre, has provided the reader with the added visceral dimension of learning beyond a dry portrait of each subtype. The use of colored pictorials, matrix charts and anecdotal evidence provide the reader the opportunity to get a real sense of how each sub-type represents him or herself in the world both visually and verbally; not just what they will do but how they do it.$LABEL$1
Great read!. I loved the book. I loved the easy access to purchase the item and had the ability to read it from both my ipad and iphone anywhere I was without having to carry a bulky book. Can't wait to purchase other books :)$LABEL$1
An experienced look. I tried not to be overly objective and I also attempted to be open to the contents of this book, I still found some things very hard to swallow. I have not yet fully completed my reading, but I will tell you this...Satanism is not a mental disease. The mental disease area belongs to those who think as this book reads. I have been a Satanist my entire adult life. But to tell me that I have a mental disease not a relgion is just the same as saying that all Christians and Catholics are diseased. If you do read this book, just remember...those who write about what they do not know spead a sead of misinformation and seads of the brain if used unwisley can be very distructive. I will give you a full editorial when I am finished from cove to cover.$LABEL$0
Legend of the Monk and the Merchant. This book was an easy read with 12 principles discussed in a storytelling manner. I received this book from BookSneeze and finished the book within 2 days. I would recommend this book to teens or those in their early 20's, who are just starting out in the real world. Financial gain seems to be the biggest goal of our youth, and this is a great reminder that hard work pays off in more ways than material posession.$LABEL$1
worked for about 2 hours. Like others here, my speakers worked for about 2 hours then died. As I was past Amazon's return policy I contacted AR, which was purchased by Thompson Electronics.

A charming cookbook. This is a softcover Slavic cookbook that I bought used, the last one available at the time in the summer of 2012. I looked for the cookbook after Lydia Kalaida passed away recently. I studied with her at the University of Wisconsin. I have made one recipe from the book so far, the egg white cake, and it was very nice. The contributors to this cookbook all write knowledgeably. I was glad to find this book.$LABEL$1
Works with reservation. This pump is a step backwards from the previous two battery version (this one has three batteries). The additional battery make it too heavy on the top so it doesn't sit well in the pot. It has a tendency to tip over, or at least shift from the position you set it at.I would agree with some of the other reviews that it seems to loose power after the first use. The thicker the oil, the harder a time it has. If you heat the oil before filtering, it works much better. Note that you don't want to get the oil too hot - perhaps nothing hotter than 100 degrees. I cracked the clear tube in my old two-battery one by running boiling water through it (requiring the purchase of this model).If you can find the older version, I highly recommend it, but the three battery version is definately a step backwards.$LABEL$0

This is a great violin for both beginners and advanced players. I took a chance on this violin, and I am really glad I did. The sound quality of this violin is truly excellent. The finishing job is good, but not super. The strength of this violin is its beatiful sound quality. My opinion is that the finishing quality is pretty much worth what you are paying for, but the sound quality is at least worth 3 to 4 times the price of this unit.$LABEL$1

Nothing Original. I own every domestic Esbjorn Svensson Trio album and this is the first one to disappoint me. With each of their other albums there are songs that are truly unique in composition, sounds and performance. However, this album is missing that innovation. To me, this album sounds like it was made by taking a handful of older, mediocre EST songs, dropping them in a blender and mastering what comes out. It sounds rehashed. The songs also aren't differentiated from each other, so it's not very noticeable when one song ends and another begins.$LABEL$0

Extremely BAD Product. Turtle Wax advertises that this is safe for all wheels. This produced a white milky haze all over my wheels that was incredibly hard to remove.

Fascinating book. Easily one of my favorite books, has to be read to be appreciated. Below my review, reviewer Zack brings some interesting points to the table, some of which I agree with. But overall I find this book has great depth and provides a broad yet detailed description of the culture in which Sayuri develops. I know I will read this book again. Just like Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevski. You always find something that you missed on the first read of a great book! And it always moves you, no matter how many times you read it.$LABEL$1
The Best 90s Metal Album, period.. That's right, kiddies, you read correctly. This album, Devy's second endeavour unattached to Vai's apron strings into the big bad world of extreme metal, is a masterpiece on every level. Nine tracks of sheer neck-breaking metal. I still have not heard another album as heavy - and when I say heavy, I don't mean I haven't heard much metal. I HAVE heard Origin. I HAVE heard the Berzerker. They are heavy - VERY heavy: City is heavier, and I'll tell you why.This album has dynamics without ever losing the pace, intensity or insane yet calculated aura that most metal cannot replicate. This album sounds crazy when it's not and has a sound that not even black metal, death metal or a thousand blastbeats can imitate. A song like All Hail the New Flesh only comes along once in a metal half-life (something like 15 years, maybe). You don't have to concur. Listen for yourself. Redefine metal. City did.$LABEL$1

Bargincell is not a bargin. Bought this product from Bargincell. Was very disappointed. This was our 1st purchase from Amazon when so many people have been telling us to order from Amazon for various products. Was very cautious and now I see why. The ethernet cable we ordered was sub standard. We had to play with it, jiggle it several times to eventually get it to work. It is smaller than a regular sized ethernet. If someone is selling a product please sell legitimately so people will feel comfortable using you again. Their credibilty is shot b/c I know they knew what and why they were selling that irregular cable. We agreeed it was not worth the hassle to return the cable.$LABEL$0

Absolute genius!. Without a doubt this is a "must have" to anyone who collects moviesor who enjoys Shakespeare. Kenneth Branagh's interpretation of this classic work is brillant. He is true to the original. The acting is outstanding. He makes it come alive. And if for no other reason, buy this movie just to have the Saint Crispin's day speech (Act 4, Scene 3).$LABEL$1
A Must Read !. This book is experiencing a rebirth among readers these days. I think that our growing concerns about America's current political and economic course are motivating many of us to learn more about our country's roots. And George is a great place to start.The last I heard much about George Washington was in elementary school. I remember the cherry tree story, but my knowledge of this gentleman was pretty sketchy beyond that. I had the impression that he was a good and honorable man, but again, I had few specifics.This book took care of that. This amazing man makes all of our contemporary Presidents pale in comparison. His interests were in strengthening our country and helping it to grow, PERIOD. He lead our country honorably and with little self-interest, or so it seems.This book should be required reading for every US Presidential candidate.$LABEL$1

Get her off the Nitrous Oxide!!!. Being a teenager in the Eighties I had enough of "Hey Micky" it was bad then and it's bad now. Avril was nothing but throw away pop on her first record, but her second record was like an entire other person and it was very good. This, This, This??This is terrible. Not just a let down, but a bad, bad record. The lyrics are strung-together cliches that required no effort, the music sounds programed and the style is pure, unadulterated, pop garbage. She stepped right in to fill the void left by Britany Spears, that's what she did. Also, it appears she is suffering from Fergie worship.Please, please, someone get her some Tori Amos, Alanis, Sarah McLachlan! Anything to stop her from recording this bland, boring tripe! Why waste the talent shown on the second record, why waste my time and money on this disk. I won't, I downloaded, I deleted. Bad, bad record by any standards.My teeth where rotting from listening to it, it's that sugary.$LABEL$0

This company has serious adventure potential. In one of the best tributes to old-school fantasy adventure games in many years, Wicked studios has made a labour of love in the articulate rendering of their gigantic magical school.

Get the Bravado instead. I don't write a lot of reviews, but just have to say it: It DOES itch in the back. I'm keeping it as a backup; the rest of the bra is comfortable enough.

Same old same old.... I've been a fan of BLACK 47 from their first release. And I'm just obsessive-compulsive enough to have all of their CDs. After listening to "New York Town", I must say that I've heard it all before. Does Mr. Kirwin EVER change his singing style? I found his voice modulation and practice of forcing way-too-many words into just about every song irritating. Before the first song was over this thought went through my mind: Could I be playing ANY of the other BLACK 47 CDs?I've given considerable thought to this review. I've regarded the progression of other musical artists through their careers and how the evolutionary process either added to or detracted from their quality and attraction. In brief: change is good. BLACK 47 (aka Larry Kirwin) cannot or will not change. Therefore, my collection of BLACK 47 music must now, as of this latest offering, be considered complete.$LABEL$0
Changed my mind about HP products. After 2 months of use the printhead unit failed. Very very frustrating. After reading all the reviews on this product, I guess, there is no need to reiterate that it's a lousy printer and a total waste of money. DO NOT BUY IT! I am now on the market to buy a new color laser printer but I will definitely shy away from HP products from now on, even if the reviews are good.$LABEL$0
Fun and Learn. With my eight year old son and infant daughter, I reviewed "Mandarin Chinese Beginning Level 1" presented by Language Tree. What amazes me the most is they make the language learning process entertaining, rather than the traditional way of "pain".Several songs throughout the video make the whole process fun! Literally, you can dance with the songs while you and your children are learning - that's what I did with my kids. The short sentences are easy to follow, and for every scene you get a quick review on what you just learned. The multiple story sessions are situations you bump into daily. It is amazing that all of the above is packed in just 30 minutes! I am waiting for Language Tree's next video to be produced.Martin LiuActivity Director (School Years 2003 - 2005)Board of San Diego Chinese AcademyLa Jolla, California$LABEL$1
My thoughts on this package. I was given this book/cd as a Christmas present from an ex-lover. While I generally agree with all of the reviews that are posted here, I will tell you that the song makes me really sad and I've stopped playing it. Please don't let that discourage you from purchasing this item, because it is nicely done.$LABEL$1
An Unusal Story for Preschoolers and Aspiring Scientists. In 1992, a crate of 29,000 rubber bathtub toys washed overboard off a ship bound from Hong Kong to Washington, USA. Hundreds of toys have since been found in coastlands around the world, shedding light on our understanding of how currents, winds and tides interact. This book traces the story of one bathtub toy from the time its crate boards the ship until it is found by a boy in Alaska. The story draws young readers in by personifying the toy as if it is experiencing its journey as a sentient creature. Caldecott Medal Winner David Wisniewski illustrates the story in cut-paper collage, skillfully rendering the dramatic power of the ocean without being too frightening. This is an unusual story that may not appeal to every reader, but for those who prefer "real" stories or who are interested in science, it's a sure winner. It's best suited for preschoolers and early elementary readers.$LABEL$1
great scanner, highly portable. Great device for cutting down on paper clutter. Main uses for me are receipts (I create a PDF of all receipts from a single trip and zip it with the expense report), for business cards which I sync with Outlook and for general notes -- I never have to worry about having the right paper folder along on a trip.Outlook sync for business cards is great but could map more fields or allow user to adjust the maping. For example, would like to map attachments and back of card (particularly Chinese cards) into Outlook.$LABEL$1

Don't step in the Bleep, strictly for culties. What the Bleep Do We Know is like shoveling copious amounts of kitty litter down your throat, you may temporarily alleviate hunger, but at what cost? Can you possibly consume enough of that stuff to mask the giant turd, that was once your brain?For some people, keeping an open mind involves closing your eyes and following any appeal to your ego. The Universe does not, with baited breath, wait to see if you will rubberstamp it's continued existence, nor does it deal in polls to see where mankind's intention as a whole lay and adjust itself accordingly.This DVD will make jabbering chimpanzees out of many otherwise well intentioned individuals. Taking seriously the musings of Dr. Michel Ledwith, ( Pedarest ) and a she-male god(dess?) named Ramtha, in conjunction with discourse about quantum mechanics from a " Life Coach, " the good, " Dr " Joe Dispenza, will leave you staggering out the other end of the rabbit hole deaf, dumb, and blind.$LABEL$0

Great tool...but beware if you are a traveling engineer. I purchased the Cybertool because I am a traveling engineer and find that I need to open computer and networking equipment a lot when I'm on the road. The tool is great and very handy. I have only one complaint about the Cybertool...since I travel every week, I will not check bags (playing the odds by checking bags every week will definitely result in lost luggage many times a year) and the Cybertool will not pass through TSA security checkpoints. This makes the Cybertool useless for me. It would be nice if the Cybertool and all other Swiss Army knife models were listed in a matrix that showed which ones can be checked according to TSA security rules. This seems like it would be an easy task...perhaps that is a project I can work on sometime unless it already exists out there.$LABEL$1
A variety of good & bad. If you can overlook some of the lamer episodes and just focus on the more plot-hole oriented episodes, you should find it interesting.Yes, one of the episodes is 'darker' in nature. Ponies are captured by dragons and turned into dragons by a centaur who keeps a throbbing 'dark' rainbow in a bag around his neck. Seeing the ponies in chains is sad, but not scary. My nieces & nephew (4, 6, & 8) LOVED this episode most of all and even began singing along with the seaponies halfway through the song!The rest of the episodes are all about friendship, helping one another, and saving the day. Sure, Crunch the Rockdog turned bushwoolies into stone, but they came back to life after he was cured of his stone-headedness. :D$LABEL$1
Nice music - POOR SOUND !!!. There is not much I can say about Mike Rowland music. Simple melodic piano tunes with synthesizer strings. I like it and it's the reason I bought it.I originally had bought the "Fairy Ring" on tape, and quite recently I decided to buy it on CD too, to enjoy it on my just bought, multi $$$ thousand stereo system. The man who remastered the recording however (if anyone did at all), must have been deaf. The CD sounds as bad as(if not worse than) my worn-out tape cassete. I was thinking of buying "Titania" too on CD, but I probably won't after that. That's too bad for the music cause I honestly think it's worth it. I hope the "Fairy Ring Suite" sounds better.$LABEL$0
DON'T BUY!. I should have read the reviews before buying. What a waste of time and money! I ordered the quees size, but doubt if they would even fit a twin size bed! They are so thin too. DON'T BUY!$LABEL$0

Patterson simply stinks these days. I don't know why I bought this book; I've been less and less happy with Patterson's work. It's getting repetitive, the 8-million-chapters thing is just laziness for actually developing a story and/or characters, and his skills appear to have deteriorated beyond hope.But I bought it anyway, read the whole thing, and then did something I almost NEVER do. I chucked it straight into the trash.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. If you've liked his stuff in the past, you will almost certainly be disappointed.$LABEL$0
Great book!. Star Light, Star Bright is a mix of intrigue and mystery with some passionate romance intermixed. Connor Phillips is beautiful, highly intelligent and challenges Franklin Hayes at every step during their encounters-be it business or desire. Connor wants to prove to Franklin that she only wants his trust and his love. Franklin believes that Connor is trying to sabotage his company. That is, until she is kidnapped and he sees his world coming to an end. For deep in his heart, he knows that Connor only wants the best for him and his company. After all, she wished for it upon a star.$LABEL$1

I also bought Make Every Man Want You, and 101 Ways to Get and Keep His Attention, both of which were dwarfed by this astounding book.Happy reading!$LABEL$1
I am dissapointed with the design. This device concept is excellent. However, the designers could have made it easier to clean when mold began to grow!

a great present for Father's Day. My husband made a comment about this watch while he was looking for another watch, and I just saved it in the cart until I was able to purchase it. He wears it when we go out together. It's not an everyday watch. It looks very expensive, and it stands out for people to see you own nice things. If he was to buy a watch he would have spent more money, but he was very pleased when I gave him this watch as a gift. Plus he didn't know that I got it at a great price.$LABEL$1

Interresting. Like I'm 51 and not much into gothic/death metal. I recently met Christopher and because of that I bought the CD. These guys can play music! The female vocalist is very nice and the ballad, "Harlot" is very good. Chris does a nice job on the keyboards. My only complaint is the 'demon' voice that pops up in every song. I do think they could do an interresting cover of "Eleanor Rigby" though. I mentioned this to him and he said, "Wow! We have a list and that is one of the songs on it." So, maybe the next album will feature that famous Beatle tune. So, give this one a try. Curl up in front of the fire, but don't get scared when the demon sings.$LABEL$1
Kindle edition is simply unusable. The ebook has no formatting at all. There are so many chapters packed with potentially good information and no way to get to them easily. A table of contents is included but doesn't include any links to jump to the relevant chapters. You just have to guess the location repeatedly to try and get to the point you want. There are no page numbers either which isn't unusual for an ebook but would help since the TOC is not linked.The book has too much potential information in it and it's simply not accessable in an ebook format unless you just love location guessing or endlessly flipping pages forward/backward. I don't know how good the content of the whole book is but the book is impossible to navigate. If the TOC became linked it would probably be great as an ebook but sadly it's not the case. Whoever put this out clearly just dumped a text file into the Amazon system without any thoughts to making it a reader friendly experience. I returned it for a refund.$LABEL$0
Not his best. I don't understand how the same author can write really good books (likeThe Shawshanke Redemption and The Green Mile) and then some really awful ones like Dreamcatchers and Kingdom Hospital, to name a couple. This book isn't one of the absolute worst he has written but it is a far cry from being good. I was able to listen to the unabridged CD version which I got at the library. I hadn't read a good book in a long time, so it was passable to listen to this one. If I had just read a good book, I am sure I would not have been able to get past disc one. My advice is to get this at the library if you think you want to read it. it isn't worth buying.$LABEL$0
Excellent Product. I purchased this product for my grandmother, as she is in recovery after surgery for a perforated ulcer. Her physician prescribed a program of some low impact exercise and recommended a staionary pedal device. I came onto Amazon's site so that I could research these products and choose the best one. After reading the posted reviews and taking all that was written into consideration, this is the pedal exercise which I chose.The product is sturdy, yet light weight. My grandmother has been able to use it without any problem and she enjoys it. Highly recommended!!!$LABEL$1

More like Prince of Sadness.... Ok, the first 2 CD's are good. Demos, live songs, etc... What else can you ask for? then you start listening to CD #3. Ummm, duets with rappers??? what the $#$@% was that??? come on, is true Ozzy is not out to please loyal fans but to make new ones. I agree with most reviewers, the price of the boxset is a bargain, but if I want to pay money to listen to Ozzy stuff, it BETTER be Ozzy stuff, not collaboration with others that is just crap. What's next? Maiden doing duets with Gwen Stefani? Oh please no...I'm a huge METAL fan...lets keep it that way...Bottom line, buy at your own risk. If you are an loyal Ozzy fan, you may not like it. If you are a newbie that listens to today's mainstream music, maybe you'll find this pleasent to your ears.$LABEL$0
A good start. This book is great for anyone looking for a starting point for historical and geographical information on the railroads of northern New England. Maps of each railroad (as well as certain regions) featured in this book make it easy to locate where a railroad was located, what cities it connected, among other things. I highly recommend this book for model railroaders and railfans, as well as anybody just interested in general history of the New England region.$LABEL$1
Great workout!. I was looking for a toning workout to use along with my regular cardio routine. I really like this workout because it is broken up into 4 targeted sections, abs, arms, legs, and buns. I can work all of the areas or pick just one depending on my area of focus and time available. I also like that I can change up the order of the workout so I don't get bored by doing the same workout every time. This DVD was a great find. It was just what I was looking for in a toning workout.$LABEL$1

Effects, effects, effects. Jimi Hendrix! The guitar god! What a sham. Yes,Jimi Hendrix was one of the greatest guitarest that ever lived, but he wasn't a guitar revolutionary he was an effects revolutionary. He made the guitar sound weird with a wah-wah and fuzz, what's the big deal. To me this whole album is a jam using new "techniques" to ad an edge and that's it an edge. I'll admit many numbers get me going, but this album is no different from any other Moby Grape or Stepenwolf (not to say these bands are bad). By far though, the worst thing on this album are the lyrics, they're senseless readings of psychelic words and discriptions of drug trips. In fact I think the most revolutionary thing about this album is Mitch Mitchel's druming. I'm not saying the album is bad it's actually very good it's just one of the most over-rated albums ever.$LABEL$0

Worthless piece of trash. Length:: 3:10 MinsThis is my first ever video review of a product on Amazon. I was inspired to do a video review because this product is so appallingly awful. I'm stunned by the positive reviews - they're either reviewing some other product, or their shills, or, well, I don't really know what would cause someone to give this product a positive review. Hopefully this video demonstrating how flimsy and downright tiny this so-called splatter guard is will save others the trouble and cost of buying one.$LABEL$0

I hated this game!. I have always enjoyed the other games, but this one suck. In the other games you visited other worlds, and had really great challenges. But this was only in one little world, and hardly any levels or challenges. I would suggest you not get this game. It was really bad. The only thing that was good was the change in the quality of the graphics compared to the other games, and the extra special powers that Spyro gets. But to be honost, it's not worth having. I mean I beat this game in half a day and I like games that are challenging and take some time to accomplish. Not something that you can beat in half a day. Don't waist your time or money on this game. It isn't worth it.$LABEL$0
Waste of Time and Money. This book is little more than a long list of things to take with you to the bunker when the end is nigh.

A Good Fit for My Purpose. One of the frustrating things with a study bible is the lack of margin space. This bible was specifically referred to me by a friend because they knew my frustration. You see, I "mark" my study bibles such that when I refer to my index that I place in the front of the bible listing subjects, and linking an initial text, the wide margins make it very easy to mark the next text to which I should refer on the same subject. With the additional space I can still make notes in the margin. This enables me to use my study bible for giving bible studies even when I don't have a "lesson" with me.$LABEL$1

a gift for my inner nerd.. This was definiately an Impulse buy. I could have got the movies seperately for cheaper, but i have always wanted a puzzle box in one form or another and then I seen this.It came well protected in its retail packaging, but the box leaves something to be desired. Made of a cheap lightweight plastic it is noticably lighter than it looks. It gives off the impression that you can rotate the halves of the boxes and in essence "play" with the box, but that is not the case, as the halves only fit together in one way. When put together, the fingers of the box halves have nothing to be supported against at the tip and will flex inward.The movie quality is as others described it, and makes for an enjoyable experience.In all i'm still happy with the purchase, although I'll probably put the discs into a binder and add some weights to the box and glue it shut, to use as a paperweight of sorts.$LABEL$1

More exceptional work from Rob Zombie. Start to finish, this CD was amazing. If nothing else, the way that the songs differ. Some have hard, driving, banger-music written all over it, while others are just as great a song but is presented in a completely different way. I was also struck by how unsimilar this was to La Sexorcisto, not to put it down but i enjoyed this just as much if not more than La Sexorcisto. Overall this is just quality music that will bring hours upon hours of listening pleasure.$LABEL$1
No sturdier than your average break-away cat collar. I bought this for my cat who needs to wear a tag to activate our cat door. We had already lost 2 collars that I bought at PetCo and I had hoped that these would be better- still "break-away" but maybe not as easily? Not the case, it's 2 months later and my cat has lost both of these collars as well. They are cute, but expensive and no more durable than the $2 version at your local pet store.$LABEL$0

un-insightful. This book is a waste of time and money. I purchased it to get an alternative perspective from my own "conservative" world view. This book comes off as a far-left, baseless slash at the right, which was intended to exploit the political hype of the day and show up on Google searches because of the term "lies" in the title..Unfortunately, it was a waste of my money and the time I took to begin reading it. Despite my desire to find an insightful look into the other world view by purchasing this book, I've decided to go ahead and invest my time in that other book I previously refused to purchase because the same terms in the title imply that it's irrational and un-objective, ... a fair and balanced look at the right...$LABEL$0
Jessica Biel -- ANNOYING. My previous review of this horrible film failed to address the Jessica Biel factor -- a factor which so many of you have pointed out.I nominate this Jessica Biel character for most annoying actor of the year, along with Lisa Kudrow in WONDERLAND.The only reason I kept watching this film was to see Leatherface hang Biel from a meat hook. My bad judgement! Jessica Biel is the one responsible for all the problems. Smoke some weed? She can't! Leave a rotting corpse behind? She can't! Put the guy hanging from a meat hook out of his misery? She can't! Act?? SHE CAN'T!!Suffice to say that in the middle of a Texas chainsaw massakree Biel goes on an anti-marijuana crusade.$LABEL$0
Entertaining, but completely shallow. Hot chicks with bio-mod razor nails? Shallow characters, shallow world. None of the humor, quirkiness, and philosophical insights as authors like Philip K. Dick, Lem, or Alfred Bester. Mostly style, very little substance. If Cyberpunk were a type of Rock & Roll it'd be 80's glam, lipstick & hair bands. Oodles of D&D; Nerd 'Cool Factor'with hardly the philosophical intrigue of the highly derivative Matrix trilogy. While I'm sure this is blasphemy to the cyberpunk fans everywhere, the chip on my shoulder left by books like Neuromancer and Snow Crash is taking Geek Chic at face value, and realizing there's nothing behind the curtain--nothing beneath the sunken eyes of drug addicts and biotech junkies.More deserving of a comic book than a novel! Then again, I can see why this would have had more impact in the 1980s when it was originally published.$LABEL$0

These Component Cables provide a high quality picture. These cables look and feel high quality and give a high quality picture. You will need to adjust your contrast/brightness settings once you use these cables to get the best picture.For some reason when I hook up the Ps3 to my tv via HDMI I get terrible color banding.So I was forced to buy these for a fix. I was expecting a big picture downgrade, but you dont lose much. HDMI however is better, crisper and sharper picture. I've seen some tvs hooked up with cheap component cables where the color looks washed out and theres picture problems. Thats not the case with these cables, you get the feeling that these component cables deliver the absolute best component picture possible.$LABEL$1

Shiba Owner. This book is a ton of value for your money. A book like this was needed because of the growing popularity of this breed. It gives a good description of the breed as a pet, what to expect and what would be expected of you - the prospective owner.

Ghost Story. This film is in my opinion, one of the best horror films I have seen.

I think that Alice Krige looks very beautiful, & the makeup is great also.$LABEL$1
good insight into the cert. process. Perry uses extensive interviews with former clerks and Justices to gather his data on the cert. process in the United States Supreme Court. He presents the information in a very readable format that provides brings to light why some cases get heard and others don't. Ultimately he presents a decision making model that takes into consideration both the individual justices, the factors influencing cert., and the purpose of the Court. This book gives the reader a good look at the cert. process from the inside and from a non-legal perspective. It is a must read for any attorney thinking of writing a cert. petition. This book would be interesting for anyone interested in how the Supreme Court functions in our system of government.$LABEL$1

Exceptional. Even though I am an long-time Kirk Whalum fan, in this CD, he has out done even himself. This is undoubtly one of the best CDs out today, and one of his best.

The Bible of Baseball Cards. If you collect baseball cards you absolutely must have this book. It catalogs virtually every baseball card ever made, including variations and errors.Why only four stars and not five? Subtle reasons, mostly. The main reason is that this book, despite being released recently, does not do a very good job of covering the professionally graded baseball card market. This is even more surprising as Beckett does have a grading service of their own. As such, the sections covering the history of baseball cards and how to grade cards is lacking and is pretty much a reprint of what's been appearing in Beckett books like this one for over fifteen years. They really could have done a better job of modernizing those sections.However, as a reference book to help identity cards and give approximate values, this book cannot be beat. Buy it now!$LABEL$1
Good value for the price. I bought this tassel when some of my sword tassels started fray and to fall apart from age. It would be nice if more colors than just yellow were offered.This tassel is long enough and well enough made. It's far from the worst I've seen, but not as good as the best (Kung Fu Instruments). On the other hand, it's very convenient to get without having to do wire transfers to China.The only complaint I have, a minor one, is that the tassel is slightly on the heavy side. That means that it is less likely to wrap around your wrist if your hand gets too busy. That may be good for form competitions, but form competition isn't the reason I study.One piece of advice, the shipping cost for single pieces is outrageous. It just about doubles the price. The solution is to get together with your Jian class or practice partners and do a group buy. My study group just bought 15.$LABEL$1
A useful book for the historian (military or pilot).. This book is more than just a manual in that it starts with a brief history of the P-61, then goes to the actual manual which emcompasses an introduction to aircraft systems, then basic operations from walk around check to flight characteristics to release of external stores. In this age of poorly written manuals I was surprised at how clear this manual is. It will add a dimension to your understanding of the P-61 unavailable in (but complimentary to) other sources. It will be appreciated by military historians and pilots (who could compare aircraft operations with their modern "twins"). Very "large scale" modelers might also find the detailed cockpit photos useful. If you are very interested in the Black Widow you should own this book.$LABEL$1

Great Gift for Graduates!. This wonderful Dr. Seuss book is our favorite gift for graduates from High School. It is simple in its language, but very thoughtful in its message. It discusses successes as well as bumps in the road, which is a true picture of life. It is encouraging, and fun, the artwork is delightful. Read it from cover to cover, enjoy it, and think.$LABEL$1
An Incredible Duet. No Crusaders CD can be rated less than 4 stars, but this album has an incredible duet entitled No Matter how high I Get with Bill Withers and Randy Crawford. It's one of the best songs I've ever heard and worth the CD price on it's own. The rest of the CD is typical Crusaders.$LABEL$1
PATHETIC. I never knew it was possible to despise a kitchen appliance as much as I do this toaster. Take for example the frozen waffles I just pulled out of this thing and am now eating ~ one is nearly black on one side, nice and golden brown on the other. The second waffle is crisp but not brown at all on one side, and the other side is soggy...it's no longer frozen, just wet.Now maybe if this were a trend in how this thing "toasts", and if I really thought it was worth it, I could rotate the items being toasted when the cycle was half way done. BUT, it's never the same from day-to-day...except that this thing consistently fails at the one simple task it is designed to do: toast. Give me a break.This toaster in combination with the problems I've had with my matching blender (bought at the same time) leads me to one simple conclusion: "KitchenAid" simply does not mean what it used to. 0 stars.$LABEL$0
wrong age group. I think this video is aimed more for 3 - 4 year olds. My youngest is a little over 2 1/2 and loves Elmo. He's showing signs for potty learning (and has used his little potty a few times) so I thought this video and a bright new RED potty would be fun this Christmas, but we didn't even get through this video. It *talks* about using the potty but doesn't really show anything... unless it's all near the end (don't know cuz we put on Curious George).I guess we'll try it again in a few days or weeks but it's pretty lame for Elmo. Nothing like how informative Elmo's World episodes are. Just a lot of talking and some silly songs. I recommend making this video like Elmo's World. It would be a lot more entertaining and helpful for younger "potty-ing" children. A lot more FUN.$LABEL$0
Good book for a beginner. Books that I would recommend over this one: "I Am That", "Pointers From Nisargadatta", "Be As You Are", Talks with Ramana Maharshi, The Spiritual Teachings of Ramana Maharshi, The Bhagavad Gita, The Ashtavakra Gita, Advaita Bodha Deepika, No Mind - I Am the Self , and The Yoga Vasishta.$LABEL$0
Great for Connecting a Video Game Console to the Net. I play my Xbox 360 online all the time. I personally didn't want to connect it to a wireless network.

Good Primer For Anyone Looking At Oil & Gas Opportunities. Mr. Orban has penned a very useful guide to the oil business. He covers all the important aspects of the industry and packages it especially for the investor. After reading this book, you'll know most everything you'll need to know in order to enter an intelligent, informed discussion with most anyone on the subject of oil & gas. The book is particularly helpful in directing you to ask the right questions of the right people to evaluate any deal or project. If you're new to oil & gas investing, this book is a must.$LABEL$1
Magical.... What a cool book! I can't wait to see the movie now.

Read The Book Little Man Instead. This film is well cast but this movie fails in doing what it was supposed to do which was be the life story of Meyer Lansky.

I love this phone!. Ahhhhh I love this phone! I'm super organized and this phone allowed me to be that organized with all my contacts, schedules, text messageing, etc. I accidentally dropped mine in the toilet though and it stopped working, because it has massive water damage.

Never thought a washcloth could be so great!. I have pregnancy spots from my three pregnancies and was even considering getting expensive facials. I heard about using these and decided to give it a try, all I can say is I am so glad I tried these! What a huge difference! My complexion is more even tone and my face is much softer. I use on my body as well and I could tell a HUGE difference just after the first use. I continue to see my skin feeling better with each use. I will never use anything else again!$LABEL$1

Written with humor and encouragement. Written with humor and encouragement, The Girls' Guide To AD/HD is a compendium of explanatory facts and practical advice on how to life a full and successful life while dealing with peers, teachers, friends and family despite AD/HD. Three girls (Maddy, Helen, and Bo) each have unique personalities and combinations of AD/HD traits enabling the reader to learn all about what AD/HD is like for girls; how the AD/HD brain functions; how adolescence impacts AD/HD symptoms; how counseling, coaching, and medications can help; how to deal with emotions that range from anxiety and anger, to forgetfulness and depression; the advantages that having AD/HD can have; how to cope with school and homework; and how to get along with others. To put it simply, The Girls' Guide To AD/HD is "must" reading for girls having to cope with this increasingly widespread condition and should be available in every school and community library.$LABEL$1
Latoya 1. This album is one of the Hottest underground albums that I've heard in a long time.

Child Rock Star Headset. DO NOT buy this product. It is too small, even for my two year old's head (it was intended for my five year old's b-day party favors). The headset doesn't bend or stretch to fit on a head. The company I bought it from is giving me a hard time returning it (says it will take a 15% restocking fee). I will NEVER purchase from Totally Costumes again. Save your money!$LABEL$0
The Classic Detective. Anyone not familiar with all of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is truly missing out. I first read The Complete Sherlock Holmes when I was 8 (not difficult reading and very enjoyable) and have been an afficionado ever since. Holmes is, without a doubt, THE detective (see Irene Adler in "A Scandal in Bohemia"). This is the work that gave detectives a place in literature. All other mystery fiction stems from this. A must-read.$LABEL$1
What a waste of time and money. Like just about everyone else on planet earth, I loved the first three Indiana Jones movies. So, like just about everyone else on the planet, I was seriously jazzed for the new one. MY LORD, IT SUCKED. Ford is walking through his scenes, there's no thrill, no adrenaline, lame CG, unbelievable nuclear blast scenes, unbelievable scenes where multiple Russians are spraying full auto fire at our heroes and no one's ever hit, etc etc. It's just not exciting--period. Unforgiveable...Spielberg, you signed off on this? People, be warned--it's BAD. And it's a damn shame.$LABEL$0
OUR SON WAS ALMOST KILLED!!!. Please beware of this product!! We have two other swings and thought that this would be GREAT to take in the van with us.. Was I wrong!! Although our son loved the lights, I ran after our 1 1/5 year old, was out of the room LESS than 5 minutes.. our 4 month old was strapped in correctly (you should be able to leave a 4 month old in a swing..this is our 3rd in 3 years) when we returned, he was PURPLE, hanging by his neck, his head was jammed between the seat and the bar.. this is EXTREMELY unsafe.. I agree with several of the other parents.. nice idea but the seat just pops up. A 4 month old cannot even sit up by themselves (which is when you are supposed to take them out so they don't flip forward)$LABEL$0

What kind of Mother will I be?. I received this book from my Grandmother when I found out I was pregnant with my son. Reading through the pages was such a comfort for me; for you see, I am married to a sailor, and the birth of our son was very close to my husband going to sea and being gone 6 months. I had all the questions, concerning "can I do it alone?" and "do I really want a baby right now?" This book and a whole lot of prayer got us through. My son is now 20 years old. I am so glad the book is still in print, for I am now going to pass on the wisdom to a new generations of "Moms".$LABEL$1

Reiterates dilemmas, but doesn't provide insightful answers. Very disappointing, no substance, mostly full of quotes from individuals who are not very illuminating either. If you just want to know that you are in good company with your indecision, this book if fine.

Good movie... not great, but still good.. I liked the movie. And I'm not just saying that because I'm a huge Star Wars fan... I seriously liked the movie. The only reason why so many people didn't like it was because everyone was expecting such a great movie and the movie just turned out to be good.Oh, and another thing. Everyone is complaining about George Lucas not releasing it on DVD... Well he said in an interview that he was planning something special for DVD. So, wait a while and see what he has planned.$LABEL$1
This is a great Thermometer! A must have for the meart smoker!. I purchased this thermometer October 8, 2007 at the sale price of $40.35, shipped. After receiving the thermometer the first thing I did was test its accuracy by doing the boiling water test. The second the water went into a boil it hit 212 (water boils at 212). My smoker is just outside the back door and I carry the remote thermometer everywhere I go--even in the front yard. I have used it repeatedly and have never had a problem. I am waiting for it to go back on sale to order another for the multiple smoke. This is certainly a must have for the beginner or avid meat smoker. Please hurry up and go back on sale!$LABEL$1

This audio book is NOT unabridged. Not only is this audio book abridged, it's an ADAPTATION. It opens with dialogue between Gollum and his torturer in Mordor (did I miss a chapter?), where it sounds to me like they are torturing him with a stapler. Ian Holm and the rest of the cast give good performances but if you've read the books, even they won't be able to save this "adaptation" for you. I read and loved The Lord of the Rings and was looking for a nice audio version to keep me company on my long commute - well this ISN'T it.$LABEL$0
Outstanding Episodes!!!. SailFish Media did a great job to send an excellent set of the old series, "Adventures In Paradise"!

Thank you SailFish Media for providing DVD sets for this series!$LABEL$1

14-month old loves this book. My son loves this book! Unfortunately, it's a bit short, so he keeps asking us to read it over and over and over again. As with all the other 'Olie' books, Joyce's illustrations are excellent. A great book to read to an infant/toddler.$LABEL$1
Tale of Terror. This was one of several books in my pile of 'books to read.' I grabbed it just before I went on a two-week cruise to Hawaii mainly because of what has been in the news for the past several months and the picture of the aircraft carrier on the cover. I couldn't put it down and it all-but-predicted the terrorist attacks in September. I gave it only four stars because it was pretty long (500+ pages) but I was riveted for the ride. This one has it all!$LABEL$1

Ordered wrong item. I wanted to order the latest Mac version of iLife. Upon receiving your Email solicitation, I automaticaqlly selected the first iLife item that appeared on Amazon's page. Unfortunately, it was for iLife '05, rather than iLife '06. Since I already had iLife'05, I had to send it back and reorder iLife '06. To Amazon, I recommend you feature the latest version of the product and list the discounted older version thereafter. To us Buyers, i've learned to be more aware and detailed in my ordering. It saves everyone a lot of pain and suffering.$LABEL$0
A mouse for a Superman. The mouse works well. A mere click turns it on, without a complex and confusing setup process. In that respect I cannot complain. You start working with it and get excited that it works so well, without any problems, that you cannot believe. But you quickly notice that it is heavy, and in less than five minutes your hand drops dead. Oh boy! It feels like you are moving a ton of bricks. I went back to my corded mouse, a cheap Ativa, which, even if it is not as good, I can move with ease. I gave the Philips mouse two stars because it works very well, but you need superpowers to move it after a while.$LABEL$0

For shame... all a marketing ploy. I still have a visceral negative feeling about this manipulative piece of tripe. I'm sure I'm not the only person who went into the theater under the impression that this was real footage of a real event; shame on me for falling for the marketing of this complete sham! Not only that, within three minutes of sitting there watching it, I began to get motion sickness because of the completely unnecessary jiggling of the camera. They couldn't even hold the camera still when they were interviewing the supposed "townfolk" on the streets of Burkittsville. And then there's the language. I don't know if they thought it would be "cool" to say the "F" word in every sentence, but I just found it thoroughly disgusting; I started to hope for the characters to meet their end. Congratulations must go to the folks who pulled in millions by tricking their audience. Worthy of zero stars.$LABEL$0
dissapointing!!. Andrew Greeley has lost his sense of identity as a priest, otherwise he would not have published something so close to romance (code word for print-a-porn). As an alledged catholic, he is a heretic (at least in that novel). As for the rest of the book, it is a lot of sentimentalistic Irish-American superstition and drivel; taking place in an Ireland which the real Irish cannot recognize. terribly dissapointing!$LABEL$0
Buyer Beware. Is a copier expected to last more than a year or two? Purchased in spring 06 - In Oct 06 I had problems with thick black lines in my scans & copies. The fix was to remove ink cartridges, disconnect machine from surge protector, powercycle three or four times, wipe copper connects, put them back in, reconnect to computer, start it all again. It worked. Problem recurred now 5/07 only this time 2 big black lines. Got out my copy of troubleshoot, tried it again to no avail, Warranty is expired and I'm told it is a hardware problem. I feel ripped off. Stay away from this HP product.$LABEL$0
A Trucker's Wife - Wonder Woman Would've Been Served Well By Such a Mentor. Very engaging memoir of the challenges of being an OTR trucker's wife. The emotions, conflicts, and rewards (though the rewards seem quite limited),as well as her means of dealing with these challenges are well expressed through the real-life experiences of the author. The issues relevant to the relationship described here, I've no doubt, would be empathetic to any relationship where significant separation time is a factor. A good read!$LABEL$1
Exterior pockets lack security. You have to be careful with the exterior pockets because i used the side pocket to store my cel phone (i beleive its the designed cell phone pocket) and i was at a crowded event and my cel phone was stolen from this pocket which was secured only by a magnet and i didnt notice until i needed the phone which was minutes after the robbery. I recomend to use the inside pockets to store valuables, dont risk exterior pockets for anything that is not for your babys needs. I have a new baby and i hoped this bag would fit both my baby's and my 3 year old needs and it's not feasable. I just purchased a DadGear Backpack Diaper Bag and we'll see how that works out.$LABEL$0
expensive. This was designed to fit the nail head but often slips and damages the floor. I ended up using my finishing nail setting tool instead and surprisingly that worked better. The finishing nail setting tool has tiny round tip with groove instead of this flat screw driver looking tip. That groove helped to prevent slipping when I apply with a hammer. I initially thought the round tip could ruin the nail head or puncture or leave round impression on the hardwood material but this wasn't the case. I paid three dollars for the set of finishing nail setting tools (3 total in different size) at local store.$LABEL$0
Not the greatest program. I am a native German, but don't speak a lot of it at with my kids. I was looking for something that is a fun and easy way for my son to learn German, so I liked the concept of this "fun" DVD. He was 7 at the time. This DVD was very boring to him. The dialogue leaves a bit to be desired and is not very realistic - I don't know many young kids that would be excited to receive a pair of pants as their(apparently only) birthday present from his parents as the boy in the video. It's been a while since we watched this, but I seem to remember that most of the people on the DVD did not sound like native Germans. At least one of them was clearly an American with a strong American accent, and another one (I think the grandfather) sounded like he was from Switzerland and hard to understand. I am just glad I only borrowed this from our library, rather than wasting money on it.$LABEL$0
Passionate and insightful work. Rennie's work is technical and hard-going in places, but he is passionate and insightful not just on bringing out the ideas of Prof. Eliade, but also on describing the character and role of religion in the modern world. The book deserves careful and thoughtful reading and study. His defense of Eliade's early political involvements seems reasonable and fair. His defense and explanation of an inclusive definition of religion are compelling and helpful. We still have much to learn from Eliade.$LABEL$1
We love this book!. A beautifully written book that captures my children's attention, yet doesn't underestimate their capacity to grasp new words like "weathervane" or "clutch (of eggs)." I read this to my daughter at 18 months and she wanted me to read it again and again. Within a month she was reciting it. After reading it so much I memorized it and started using the story to lull my newborn son to sleep. He is now nearly a year old, my daughter is 2-1/2 and they both still love the book. I have yet to tire of it. This is my favorite Margaret Wise Brown book, including Goodnight Moon and Runaway Bunny. Another MWB book that's a big hit for our family is My World.$LABEL$1
This is a poor quality album Do Not Buy!. I don't know why in the hell everybody thinks this album is so great. As you know X raided is locked up in prison for murder so there is no way he can get to a studio to make a record right? So he raps his songs over the prison telephone and records them and yep you guessed it folks this whole album was recorded over the telephone and you get poor telephone sounding quality music for the whole album. Don't waste your money on this one folks! But don't get me wrong I think X-raided is the the only true real life original gangster rapper out there and he does deserve much respect and he does have a excellent album called Psyco Active (wich is NOT recorded on the phone either). So if you love sick perverse violent rap artits as much as I do you should get Psyco Active by X Raided but not Xorcist.$LABEL$0

Good deal just for the price... way too artificial scent. I purchased this set with Pearlessence Spa Mist Air Therapy Fountain Mister.I thought it's too good to be true if I got 6 oils for that price.Actually, it was fair enough for the price.Though I love the concept, and I really like how the humidifier works.the oil pack didn't work for me.Each oil smells too artificial. It almost smells like car freshener dangling from back mirror ...If you are expecting aromatherapy, I recommend to pay little bit morefor pure botanical essential oils.$LABEL$0
Fun, but small and easily scraped (And now broken). I saw all these reviews about how this isn't for kids that are young. My son is 6 and rides this thing with no problem, its actually a little small for him. His legs are all cramped up. Makes me wonder if the other people here have very small children, or possibly I'm raising a giant. The brake is getting scraped up and bent all the time since it sits close to the ground, its a pain to bend back and fix. The entire bottom of the cart is scraped up, but it doesn't seem to affect the drivability.The battery life on this thing is amazing. My son drove this almost two miles on a single charge. Lots of fun, adults don't fit well on it though.So, here's an edit: Its now broken and refuses to move. Kinda sucks, I guess we'll see how the warranty works.$LABEL$0
I wouldn't trust my life with it.

Luckily the threat was averted and it was not needed, but this is not what you want to worry about when your life is on the line.I would not purchase this item. Hopefully they read this review and make it with a strong ABS plastic and stronger fastening, because they sure didn't respond to my emails.Shame really, I truly wanted to believe in this product.

Mara Rocks!. I absolutely love this book. I love Egypt and the ancient culture is especially intruiging. The story of slave girl Mara who has to play double spy captured me in the delicate web of this story line. This brave girl who falls in love with one of her masters is wonderful and excellently written. I got it just because it had Egypt on it, but I instantly and unexpectedly fell in love with the characters and the tangled web of a story Mara gets herself caught in. This is a book I believe everyoneshould read. An excellent book!$LABEL$1

Think twice about buying this DVD. Nothing wrong with the film, it's the UltraViolet Digital copy you need to avoid.

I will never buy another Blu-ray/DVD/digital copy that has the Ultraviolet method.$LABEL$0
ouch!. This book hurt. I usually can tolerate some silliness in pulp horror, but this book was awful. Moore makes Bentley Little look like James Joyce. A series of drawn out fight scenes makes up the plot. The main character took so many beatings and stayed alive that I thought we were heading towards an Unbreakable finale where he ends up being a superhero. Oh, and they also hit the lottery. This is not early Stephen King, this is more like early Don King.Skip this one.$LABEL$0

My SONY Camcorder quit for no reason. I had the same thing happen with my SONY DCR-TRV19 after exactly one year. So I called the Sony support number. After holding for 45 minutes they told me my warrenty was 12 months parts, 90 days labor. They were nice enought to wave the parts seeing it is a few days past a year but they want $219 for labor!!!!!If you search the web this is a common problem with the SONY DCR-TVR19 / DCR-TRV22 / DCR-TRV33.I realy wish I'd bought a JVC. They are rated beter and less expensive. I do know that's the last Sony product I'm going to buy. 90 day warrenty for $500 dollar product is terrible.Mine doesn't have a single scratch and has NEVER been dropped.This years models are:DCR-HC20 / DCR-HC30 GARBAGE DCR-HC65 / DCR-HC85 CHEAPJUNKIt appears the first to use the same 680k CCD.

Very good techniques, but not the flavor I expected. The book is very well written and it teaches very good techniques for cooking wich gives more flavor to the food. I have tried several of the recipes following the instructions as exactly as I could, but I am a bit dissapointed because they did not seem to me very tasty. I expected to obtain results similar or equal to the dishes you have at Italian restaurants, but there are only, perhaps,a few of them. However, the flavor is not bad either, and I love the techniques given, is just that I expected more.$LABEL$1
List of reasons I love this book: Fun,Creative,Analytical.... This is a book which you fill in pages that have a title for each page/list. The Titles are for things you list. Example: List all of the people who love you for who you really are. Another example: List the things you would change if you could change history. Or: List the things you hide when friends come to visit.Some of the List headings are serious and some are silly, some delve into the past, others look to the future. They explore home, family, work , the world , your inner thoughts and so much more.This is a delightful book for anyone who loves to make lists, who loves psychology, or who wants to understand themselves a little better. It is a whole lot of FUN!$LABEL$1
Very Poor, and Confusing. Even though this book gives decent information about French pronunciation, which is a very useful way to not only learn how to speak the language, but have a grasp on how to say new vocabulary as well, it starts getting confusing once it just randomly jumps into passages, expecting the reader to all of a sudden know how to comprehend the written language without grasping grammar first. Maybe it would have been useful with the aid of an audio CD, but unfortunately it doesnt have it. And another problem with this book is the way it randomly presents new vocab when it has nothing to do with the context of the passages. Possibly a beginner can get through this book, but it would unfortunately be a long and tedious chore that will eventually bore one out of their mind! There are so many great french learning books out there, and this is NOT one of them!$LABEL$0
Gifted MC. Jeru definetly has microphone skills and he proves it on this imressive debut. The beats are also really unique and different, maybe a little to unique is the only problem. Best tracks: Come Clean, Mental Stamina$LABEL$1
Main theme : Economics?. My wife and I first saw the series online, the title images we had seen (not this one) made this look a bit... risque to say the least.We were pleasantly surprised to find no real focus on nudity beyond 'doll-esque' levels.Really the main focus is the economies of medieval times, how travelling merchants made money etc. Its fascinating in a weird way; interspersed with supernatural mythos like harvest gods and the like. Its very interesting. Hopefully a third season is on the way somewhere...As for this particular box set, the bluray titlescreen seemed a bit off, but the video itself was great. Nothing to complain about really and it played perfectly on the PS3 as well.$LABEL$1
Manfrotto Monopod. Product was shipped promptly and the quality, as well as the usability is super. It is lightweight, study and easy to use. As described in the specs, it only collapses to about a two feet length so portability is not perfect. Overall, I'm well satisfied with the product and the purchase. This is a really welcomed addition to my new 7D camera outfitting.$LABEL$1
Processor Blade. This was a new purchase, was in top notch condition and has been used frequently with excellent results.$LABEL$1
GREAT...So far so good!. I purchased this shampoo for my husband and it has been magical! He doesn't mind the smell and uses regularly. I recommend!$LABEL$1
Disappointed. I received this for Christmas from my mother and it worked only once. The motor burned out and the company would not honor the warranty. Both the company and the fountain were a HUGE diappointment. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!$LABEL$0
Cobraaaa!. As a G.I. Joe fan and collector since 1986 I even enjoy watching the original series today. As a native German I liked both Joe and Cobras alike. Both factions owned a number of great characters! Some good guys some bad guys but all of them were unique!Though I generally like Manga-Style movies and especilly the female characters look cuter than ever, I don't consider G.I. Joe Sigma 6 a worthy heir to the classic series. Sure, it contains action from the start to the end, but the character of the figures was all but neglected...Afterall I don't think Sigma 6 has much in common with the originals since only the names and the history... so it could well be name in a completly different way and is just an other Anime among others!$LABEL$0
Very fragile. Dissapointed with this product! Our daughter can not even play with it without it falling apart! Small pieces that disconnect from swing not a good idea for childrens toys!$LABEL$0
Shocking and Disturbing. Until this book I was a fan of romace novels and Connie Mason in particular. The blatant abuse and racism in this book was shocking! Our "Hero" rapes two wives, beats his slaves, and still ends up with the girl at the end. Our "Heroine" sleeps with anybody who befriends her or for whom she has pity. I wanted to see them both dead at the end. Unless you want to be disillusioned forever, DON'T read this book!$LABEL$0
Very timely. My product came just as they said it would. The shipped the product the next day. Definetely a good buy!$LABEL$1
Rubbish. I attempted to read this book several years ago and found it to be utter rubbish!! This book is worthy of the "National Enquirer" as opposed to a serious biography of Heinrich Himmler. Himmler is a subject worthy of a biography for his infamous career but Padfield's work is so full of inaccuracies on so many levels I tossed the book in the trash after the first few chapters it was so bad.A better but not nearly as lengthy biography can be found in Heinz Hoehne's "The Order of the Deaths Head." This book however is nonsense.$LABEL$0
GREAT SOUND. Johnny Smith was first known for his gorgeous guitar sound when he made one of his first albums called "Moonlight in Vermont" which I heard on mono Lp 50 years ago. His gorgeous technique was the envy of all jazz guitarists. We studied his books, but couldn't make head or tail of them.There are 20 tunes on this CD, & you'll probably recognize most of them. He is a jazz guitarist, but one who is very easy to listen to....I loved his ballad style as well as the tunes he does at breakneck speed.I particularly liked his rendition of the Duke Ellington compositions, namely "I got it bad;" "Prelude to a kiss;" & Monk's "Round Midnight."Get this album, & you won't regret it. If you're new to jazz, this is a great place to start.$LABEL$1
Is there any page without an error?????. The book is good, but like I said before is there any page without an error????? There is no published errata for the book too!!!$LABEL$0
Mike and Mister Ray Know~!. If you are here, you are looking to buy. Do it. I wish Icould give you a copy of this album and countless other songs by thisband, but I also wish you would support a band that ranks above thousands in my musical retinue. Buy, buy, buy- what is $15 for joy?$LABEL$1
Returned it. The quality of this product was very poor. The pictures shown on the various websites show a nice sandy beach and nice true color, however, this was not the case. The product does not have near the same quality of the LCD Televisions out on the market. As long as you stand about 6 feet back, you may not notice the pixels of your favorite picture.$LABEL$0
Great reading. I read this book three years ago, and someone who borrowed it never returned it. I had to buy it again, and read it to make sure I don't miss anything. Deep, but explained in a way that makes it very easy to understand.$LABEL$1
ANDREA BOCELLI (THERE ARE NO WORDS FOR HIM THE MAN IS A GOD). His words and his voice melt right through you everytime you listen to him. I'm going to actually dance to one of his songs at my wedding in about 3 months. Amazing cd.$LABEL$1
Worthless. This book's title is analogous to having scantily clad women on book covers to lure adolescent boys into buying. There is no hacking of Windows. No information that you would not already know if you were an experienced user or can obtain for free using a web search. Do not waste even a penny on this book. It is truly junk.$LABEL$0
Scratchy and Irritating. I don't understand the positive reviews on this silly wrist strap. It is VERY uncomfortable and scratchy. Even if I did were it longer than 5 minutes, it is impossible to figure out if you have it on the right spot to be effective.$LABEL$0
Hearty Soup. Wolfgang's Organic Classic Minestrone Soup is very good, filling, and tastes especially great when you add some grated cheese. This soup also has the added benefit of high fiber due to the different beans. Try it, you will like it!$LABEL$1
Good first book in a series. I must say I have bee a fan of the Breed Series for years. But that was the only stories I had read. This book was very different than that, but I really liked it, the ending was pretty obvious, but again a good story with a lot of steam!$LABEL$1
Mozart Violin Sonatas by Mutter. A beautiful rendition of the Mozart violin sonatas by two excellent performers! It is a total shame and extremely disturbing to view the poor choice of camera angles with rapid shift of images. It's a total waste of money. I could enjoy the same performance on CD and do away with the dizziness.$LABEL$0
Not for everyday people. This book is incredible in ways that are not going to be understood by the average joe. I do not know how anyone who is not a practicing Kriya Yogi could ever begin to make any sense out of this book. To the average person on the street this book is going to be complete and indecipherable non-sense.This book speaks directly to those of us who are practicing Kriya Yoga and corroborates the inner experiences one has while practicing. This book is for the sincere Kriya Yoga practitioner it offers insight into what you are experiencing.Several times while reading this book I found myself saying ah yes of course so that is what that was or is.This is a book for all Kriya yogis that trace their lineage to Lahiri Mahsaya. Now for those who are not initiated and are practicing what various writers and schools call kriya Yoga do not be surprised if you do not get it.$LABEL$1
Doesn't work. So far usuless, didn't work on any eletronic I have. Tested on dvds, blu-rays, receivers, tv, nothing... maybe I got a defective item.$LABEL$0
Sickenlingly awesome! Horrorshow good fun!. Amazingly I've seen these for sale on the shelves of Borders in the past. Thought "Special Interest" literature wasn't available unless you knew what you were ordering in advance somehow.Still this is a good and dark and disturbing collection of bizarre fringe opinions. Beware this book. It's totally work safe and family friendly, if the workplace is undergoing a post office style job complaint and the family is like that famous "Fifth Beatle" who ruined the song "Helter Skelter".$LABEL$1
Ambient Dub at its Finest. Damn this is a good CD! This is one of the first and best of the "ambient dub" sub-genre of electronic music -- a beautiful, bass-heavy, laid-back set of electronic soundscapes that sound great when you're chilling at home or too stoned to move.Ambient dub is an offshoot of electronic music that never really dominated the charts anywhere as far as I can tell, but it's a tasty, organic-sounding, and highly agreeable approach to digital music nonetheless. Higher Intelligence Agency piles colourful bloops and bleeps on top of mesmerizing basslines and relaxed beats to excellent effect. This CD is tough to track down, but well worth the effort.$LABEL$1
Very poor quality pumpkin seeds. Prior to purchasing this brand of seeds, I had always used the NOW Foods brand (which has generally been a very consistently good quality seed from my own exprience). This being my first try at using a different brand turned out to be a very big mistake. I usually purchase seeds in bulk, so I purchased 4 bags of these seeds. To my surprise, every one of the bags contained small, brown or discolored seeds, all of which are not the healthful green full flavored seeds that I was used to with the NOW Foods brand. Hey, I'm not a spokesperson for one brand or another which is why I wanted to try a different brand to compare. However, in this case, I blame myself for thinking the proverbial grass was greener on the other side....I couldn't have been more wrong in this case!.... I will never buy this brand again!$LABEL$0
Not based on fact. I stopped watching this as soon as they claimed the chicken we buy are genetically modified. This is absolutely untrue, as they are "created" by cross-breeding two varieties of chicken. If they are blatantly stating misinformation as fact in this case, I have to assume they do elsewhere in the video as well. I am tired of "foodies" labeling everything they disagree with as a GMO.$LABEL$0
Bought the Pixter instead of a Game Boy, but really no fun. I kept resisting getting my 6 year old son a Game Boy, because kids get so addicted to them and I have not been able to find educational software. So I bought this instead. This is boring and hard to use. I wish someone would just start making Reader Rabbit for the Game Boy.$LABEL$0
Even Better Than Hybrid Theory. Yes, it is no lie. Meteora is even better than Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was simply incredible. I'm so happy that Linkin Park didn't sell out and make all of their songs sound like "In the End" since they had such a success with that song. Instead, Meteora is much heavier than their first effort, Hybrid Theory. The music is better, the lyrics are more mature, and the vocals by both Chester Benington and Mike Shinoda have improved greatly. I definently recommend this album. It's what every rock fan has been waiting for.$LABEL$1
Fun with Totally Gross. We've enjoyed this game. It's great for laughs! Our only complaint is that the goo which came with the game didn't really stretch.$LABEL$1
ugh. Well folks, I grew up on comics and still love them, although I am not a frequent reader any more. I was excited to hear about this book and eagerly read it, but ....ugh. If you want some quick reading trashy sci-fi type junk, then go ahead and read it. If you are looking for an intelligent treatment of some comic-like themes, then you'd better keep waiting. This is the first novel I have read that has inspired me to pan it here, that's how bad it was.$LABEL$0
Be aware of the delay on delivery. Same experience as the last reviewer...I ordered on June 20th and haven't received the item yet. I kept receiving the emails from Amazon which asked for approval the updated shipping date.On the product URL site, Amazon still claims that this item is in stock and can be shipped in 24 hours. It is all BS. I called the customer service number many times and got told their fullfillment center has difficulty to ship the item out.This is a good product...however 1 star review for Amazon.$LABEL$0
This thing SUCKS. Pulls on hair, and makes it impossible to trim anything. You wanna scream in pain and agony. I noticed blades are all crooked after 5 times using it! The rotating head snaps off as soon as you put slight pressure on it.Horrible product basically and I hate it!DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!$LABEL$0
The Whistleblower. I thought the subject matter was very intense and dramatic, but well done. I would recommend this movie to adult audiences, but definitely not a family film.$LABEL$1
Encyclopidia for heath. this is an excelent book for type 2 Diabetes patiend or anybody who want to maintain enjoy a healthy life stile.$LABEL$1
not worth the money. I bought the cream hoping to get rid of, or at least lighten stretch marks from pregnancy. I have used it three times a day for 3 months and have seen no results. It smells horrible and having to apply 3 times a day is really a pain in the hind parts. I was very optimistic after reading some of the other reviews. I'm now very disappointed. If something sounds too good to be true, it is.$LABEL$0
good book. helped me realize how stupid things were that we were getting angry about in the relationship, also helps you look at the BIG PICTURE.$LABEL$1
A great peek inside "the bubble". I have worked on political campaigns professionally for many years and always wondered what it would be like to work for the President. This book opened my eyes beyond the glamour of the West Wing and let me ride along motorcades, helicopters and of course Air Force One. If you are interested in what goes into moving the President and his staff this is the book for you. A great read for any political junkie.$LABEL$1
Addicting!. I figured I would try this after seeing the infomercial a million times. I thought Chalene would be annoying but I was very wrong. The music is great and she is very motivating. I like how the backround people are the same in each video.You have to do the Learn and Burn and get the moves down in order to get the full effect. There are other tapes on the website in addition to these. I plan on getting those as well.Great workout overall. Very fun and never boring!$LABEL$1
2 thumbs up (& not there). This CD kicks butt. Lately I've been getting into rock bands doing covers i.e. Rick Springfield "Day After Yesterday", Styx "Big Bang Theory", etc.This does justice to the bands covered and is a definite good addition to your CD collection. Tommy Shaw & Jack Blades prove they have the chops to do these tunes justice.$LABEL$1

DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK. Don't miss this book. I loved every page of this beautifully written story about wartime in colonial america. Talk about braving the wilderness! I had no idea how tough it was for settlers in upstate New York. Great story$LABEL$1
His Best Salsa Album. Great songs, great voice. I don't think I'll will ever hear Marc make a full salsa album, without any of the pop or ballads. The style of music that in his albums are ideally not danceable, basically because the louder and more aggressive arrangements will take away from his voice. That is one major difference between him and other salseros like Victor Manuelle, Tito Rojas, etc.; they don't necessarily have the same range as Marc, but the orchestra doesn't become as a distant background. His records are to be listened to relax.$LABEL$1
Great Book! Interesting, Informative, Thanks Frank!. This was a very informative book for a beginner like me, and I'm sure pro's would find valuable inf. too. I had been using the Martingale System for a while and didn't realize it. Only I use a twist to it, letting me win every spin, except for the '0','00'. No Joke! I haven't lost yet at a wheel! This book also opened my eyes to other option that are available. Some things I really wondered about, and wouldn't ask. Read this book is a must if you like winning!$LABEL$1
Ouch, my fingers!. This is a great toy in theory, however not only have I slammed my fingers in the turning wheel, but so has my son, daughter, husband, and brother. It hurts too! I really think this toy should be recalled. It's not fun to see your babies cry when they get hurt from a senseless design on a child's toy.$LABEL$0
I'd laugh, but it's not worth the effort.. You should note the reviews on this site that praise this despicable waste of money are all from the US. It hasn't actually been released in the US.That should be your clue.(HINT : Don't waste your money.)$LABEL$0
Clancy's lost it. Underwhelming. That's really the only word to describe this book. I can't say that I'm tingling with excitement to delve into the world of John Patrick Ryan, Jr, especially when the story seems to have been thrown together in a few days. Three out of the last four Clancy books have been clunkers...hopefully the trend will reverse, but I won't be holding my breath.$LABEL$0
Disappointed. Been reading Bucklands books for a while. Very disappointed when I got to this one. I had pegged this writer as someone of authority in the issues of Paganism. Instead I find Christian rituals. Didn't they do enough damage when our ancestors were drowned, burned and tortured? I disliked references to providing them with anything in the same book as the supposed Pagan spells. By the way. Anyone can make up spells and Pagans do so by way of rituals and beliefs but most of us do NOT sell them for money.$LABEL$0
Love. I buy this on amazon when I can't find it in the store. I love that it's more natural than other conditioners, it provides great slip for detangling and a nice hit of protein for your hair. The bottle lasts me a while too.$LABEL$1
Very poor reading.. All I can say is I'm glad I borrowed the book and didn't buy it to keep. I felt Jaffe's characters lacked believability and couldn't make myself like them or want them to get together. They were very one dimensional throughout the book and they never seemed to learn anything about themselves or each other as the book progressed right up to the last chapter practically when everything resolved itself. This was totally unbelievable. I could barely make myself finish the book. As for the setting, I have no desire to read any other books placed in that time/location based on this book.$LABEL$0
Guidelines that work!. I bought Robert Hastings wonderful book in 1979 when I was launching my (what has proved to be very successful) writing career. Hastings' practical guidelines are just what every beginning writer needs; a great many "experienced" writers could use them as well. A real classic!$LABEL$1
Fell in love @ first sight!. WHEN I FIRST READ THIS BOOK, THIS WAS MY FIRST READ OF A BI-RACIAL FAMILY. I SEE MYSELF WITH A FAMILY SUCH AS THIS ONE SOMEDAY, AND I LOVED THE POETIC VERSES SO MUCH THAT I KEPT IT ON MY COFFEE TABLE FOR A LONG TIME. I ALSO HAVE A HAND DRAWN PIC OF WHEN THE FAMILY WAS OUT WALKING IN THE WOODS ON A FALL DAY. IT IS HANGING IN MY KITCHEN. I DREW IT ON A PAPER PLATE, SPUR OF THE MOMENT THING. I WAS ALSO SURPRISE TO KNOW THAT THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM THAT MADE THIS BOOK POSSIBLE,(i think they are a couple, i could be wrong)PUBLISHED IT THE SAME YR I WAS BORN. SO THEIR KIDS ARE ADULTS NOW, HOW WONDERFUL IT MUST BE TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO READ TO THEIR GRANDKIDS.KUDOS, MUCH LOVE TO THE AUTHORS!$LABEL$1
Kidde Carbon Monoxide Alarm. My old one went past its life of 5 years and I wanted to replace it with the same model which I could not find anywhere else. It is a very efficient product and I did not have to make a new place for it to fit on my wall.$LABEL$1
An Easy Read. I recently bought and read this book and thought the book was alright. It was easy to read and did not require any deep thought. I found that it WAS quite predictable. You were able to guess exactly what was going to happen and you KNEW that there was going to be a happy ending no matter what.I think that a little more conflict or more to the plot would have made this book a bit more of a challenge and a little bit more entertaining. I enjoy books where the main characters have more spunk. However, it was a fairly decent book that managed to keep my attention.$LABEL$0
Thanks CBS. We love to laugh and we like variety.. I enjoyed this reunion special as I enjoyed the other a few years ago. Thanks to CBS for allowing the most daring and adult outtakes and bloopers to be shown. It was so much fun to see Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, Tim Conway and Harvey Korman back together again and able to laugh at themselves as we laughed with them at home. Check out the blooper where Carol flashes the boobs she is wearing in front of Tim Conway. Buy the VHS video or DVD today.$LABEL$1
Were Are They All????????????????????. Why is everything I want (this prouduct included)at Amazon.com out of stock. You would think that a site that sells so much would not be able to sell so much without keeping the items in stock(could sell much more and make much more if they did; hint hint) My rating of the game is not accurated because I don't have it because it is out of stock!!! HINT HINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!$LABEL$1
What a gifted & lyrical writer!!!!. Dave Kindred ranks among America's finest sportswriters. He and the late Shirley Povich were the best sports columnists The Washington Post ever had (present sports columnists included). The stories in Kindred's book are a joy to read. He's got a Ring Lardner touch. At his best, no one is funnier than Kindred. A few of his tales feel like a Frank Capra movie, sentimental and heart-warming. Baseball captures the essence of America with love of family, country and seventh inning rallies. Kindred makes it come all come alive. His stories on Mark McGwire and Jackie Robinson must be savored. You'll finish this book and feel like playing catch with your kid.$LABEL$1
WOO HOO!! ;)- HUBBY IN A TUX.... This was such a fun purchase because my husband and I learned how to tie a bow-tie! Okay...I lied, HE learned how on youtube while I watched, This really looked sharp with his 007 style tuxedo he wore on our cruise. It fit his large neck -with no room left to spare (4XLT at the time). It was inexpensive and the bit of texture added a nice touch.$LABEL$1
Broken upon arrival. I ordered this dartboard thinking wow, looks like some great technology. Only I never got to experience the joy of throwing, because it was broken when I opened the package. There was a dent in the wooden cabinet, a seem on the cabinet was splitting apart, and the dartboard itself had a broken plastic piece. Overall not pleased, but can't speak for the play of the dartboard itself. When bought from Amazon, the package comes in its original box, thus not protecting the item whatsoever while being shipped.$LABEL$0
Keep it clean. I do alot of the string changes and maintenence for my band. We all use this poduct every time after we play. When our string eventually go dead and it is time to change them out they still feel like brand new. The strings continue to sound new much longer and never have the feel of a gritty coroded surface when this product is used regulary. The bottle seems to last forever even though I use it all of the time. I just bought a second bottle even though I am only about half way through the first because I dont want to run out. Rub a little on with the aplicator tip, let it set for a few momments, wipe clean with a lint free rag. Dont play dirty. BUY and USE this prodoct.$LABEL$1
Excellent Product. Excellent product within affordable price. I had used before various types of rice cooker such as Sanyo, Krups and Moulinex but I have find Zojirushi is the best because of light weight and super non-stick cooking pot. I am using it almost three times a day but found no dusturbance while I am new user but in my experience and Asian ethnicity I think it is one of the best product available in the USA market.$LABEL$1
A major let down. This game is a serious let down for all Rainbow Six fans, it's main highlights include poor storylines and plots, edgy cinematics and re-inforced by terrible graphics. This is a major dissapointment, and really I wreckon this game should never have been dreamt up, let alone released, it's terrible and should never see the light of day.$LABEL$0
drawing table. The table has a nice large surface which is nice. However one side of it was damaged in shipping. I used it for the bottom. The folding aspect of the table is great and really easy to use. It adjusted perfectly to fit our daughter. Overall really nice product.$LABEL$1
Iron Man Combo Pack rules!. My son could not decide between the Iron Man 2 Movie on Blue Ray or DVD. I came across the combo pack at Amazon and was so excited. It also comes with a Digital copy.

Defective BRAND NEW. Bought from Lowe's for $329. Followed all the start-up procedures, ran it for 5 minutes and the tank pressure gauge would not go beyond zero.

I'll be returning this tomorrow and request replacement otherwise I go for another brand.$LABEL$0
Predictable, popular, pleasant. This scent is becoming more and more popular. Almost ever guy I know has owned this once before which takes away the prestige.it's almost immediately noticeable. Overall the ladies still love it even though someone else will most likely have it on everywhere you go. lol$LABEL$1
A great book about maya art and culture. This book is well worth the price and a must for anyone interested in maya art and culture. Aside from the full color photographs of maya figurines from museums in both Mexico and the US, I also like the layout of the text which is divided into 10 chapters categorizing the figurines pictured and describing each one with extra explanations when needed. Definetely one of of the best books on the subject, highly recommendable.$LABEL$1
It was so bad, it's sad that it will be taking up space in landfill. Got it and immediately checked it out using the regular plug. No problems in the 5 minute trial. Got in the car and it did not work with the plug for the lighter. We bought a new plug. It took 4-5 tries loading a disk before it would stop telling us that there was "no disk". This included two brand new, out of the box DVD's. The "ok" button didn't work on the unit so we had to use the remote. The cables weren't really tight, so sometimes they would unplug. Not a huge deal, but the unit had to be turned on again every time and our kids aren't old enough to do this themselves.At this point, we were almost ready to try to trade it. An hour later my son kept saying his screen was turning off. Then, it turned off completely and it never went back on.Not a good deal for all the aggravation. If you've got kids, you have better ways to spend your time.$LABEL$0

Illegal Drugs Save The Earth!.... One of the better SCREAM offshoots, THE FACULTY succeeds at being an excellent 90s high school version of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS w/ enough paranoia, terror, and humour to keep things interesting. The cast is unbelievable, including Clea Duvall (HOW TO MAKE A MONSTER, THE KILLING ROOM), Josh Hartnett (HALLOWEEN H2O, 30 DAYS OF NIGHT), Framke Janssen (LORD OF ILLUSION), Elijah Wood (THE ICE STORM, LOTR, SIN CITY), Robert Patrick (TERMINATOR 2, EYE SEE YOU), Piper Laurie (RUBY, CARRIE), and Salma Hayek (FROM DUSK TILL DAWN) as the school nurse! This movie proves what we've always suspected, that our teachers are human hosts for alien parasites! This explains a lot! We also learn that illegal drugs are the salvation of mankind. The alien invaders just can't handle them! Whew! THE FACULTY is fun-tastic! Cheers...$LABEL$1
Call it what it is - their big breakthrough.. If "selling out" and "abandoning the grassroots" is how highly talented, immensely listenable bands like Vertical Horzion hit the big time, well, I just wish it'd happen more often. This is, quite simply, beautiful music. There's been so much baggage hung on the whole alternative music, it's refreshing to see a return to the basics of harmonious composition and great singing. There isn't a bad moment anywhere, not one bit of sappiness, annoyance, boredom, insufferability, or any other of the failings that have doomed countless promising albums. In a nutshell, if you love music, this album quite literally has everything you want.$LABEL$1
The Clash of Cultures. This is an extraordinary account of the Mhong culture with its beliefs and mores. Being uprooted and immigrating to the USA at the end of the Vietnam conflict truly changes these gentle agrarian people. Without the courtesy of interpreters the life of one Mhong child is direly affected when the beliefs of the Mhong conflict with Western medicine. A true tragedy in peaceful times!$LABEL$1
Not a fan of Oates. I have tried to read the work of this amazing writer and more often than not find myself closing the book completely uninterested in the characters and/or the story. Technically, I can appreciate and even admit to the awe she inspires. But for some reason her writing leaves me cold.This was only the second of her books which I managed to finish and I genuinely enjoyed this novel very much. The narrator is flawed and vulnerable, tough and offensive, and I wanted to know what would happen to her and to her gang.I like this book. I will continue to try to read Oates whenever the impulse presents itself. But I will also forgive myself if I am unwilling to finish what I start.$LABEL$1
I ordered the hardcopy and I received a useless audio disk which is waste of my money. I order only hard copies of books and with my order I received 3 books and instead of this book I received an audio disk.Its a waste of my money for shipment, VAT tax 20% which I pay for import, etc. I would never pay for an audio disk of a book!!! I will never shop from Amazon.com again!Maybe this book is good, but I will never know.$LABEL$0
The Last Hurah. These episodes are original, thought provoking, and well told. They both would have made exelent live-action shows, though Koo-Koo-Khan would have been quite expensive to produce. It is truly a shame that NBC decided to cancel the series after these two episodes aired. Since it was shown early on Saturday mornings, young children were the prominant viewer, and they just didn't "get" the show.

Stories. This is not a book on haunted locations in California. Instead it is a collection of stories that occurred to people in California. You won't find the Queen Mary in here or Alcatraz or the Hotel Del Coronado or any other location that you can physically visit. Instead you will find stories that happened to real Californians in their homes, businesses, etc.If you're looking for interesting real ghost stories, this is a book for you. It is an interesting read, and the stories are entertaining. If you're looking for detailed information on specific visitable concrete locations within California this is not the book for you.$LABEL$0

I miss my old fit n fresh. I had the old fit n fresh for years and loved it every single time that I used it. After wear and tear, I decided it was time for a new one. Bad decision. The salad dressing compartment leaks defeating the purpose of even having a special compartment!! I'm so disappointed. I will definitely be looking into returning this. I know it's only $10, but it's the principle of buying something that doesn't work that irks me.$LABEL$0
Must-have for silent era fans. This collection is an absolute must-have for fans. I have another collection, the Slapstick Encyclopedia, but this collection is much better. The features are high-speed and show the best snippets from silent reels instead of the whole thing, and the background music, sound effects, and narration are superb. Two thumbs up!$LABEL$1

A fun introduction for kids. This set rocks! The child (over 6 years old), with parent's guidance, can immediately follow a starter project to do a simple hookup and get immediate results (lighting, sound, etc). I can see the big smiles from my kids, and that brings a great deal of satisfaction as a parent.My kids would try more than 15 projects in the next few days, before their interests move on to something else. The AM radio is the absolute favorite. The tuner, however, can't really get few stations.But it's a great introduction to basic electronic components nonetheless. They learned the wiring, flow of current, switches, resisters, capacitors, speakers, etc.$LABEL$1
I thought this book was O.K. but nothing special.... To be honest this book really didn't do much for me. It was a bit boring. Nothing was really going on in the book & the couple didn't even start a relationship until the last 10 pages of the book & then all of a sudden they were wed. Rachel came to Springwater to be the first teacher & upon her arrival she meets Trey & soon finds out that he is part-owner of the Saloon across the street from her school. She despises the Saloon but they soon find that they care for one another. Not much more then that. The book was just lacking something. It needed some adventure or something. I sure hope the rest of this series gets better. This is book #2 in the Springwater series.$LABEL$0
Amazing. This is not your typical John Grisham book. When I started reading it, I didn't know anything about it. By the end, I was crying because it so moved me. I truly enjoyed this book. It's written from the perspective of a young boy who doesn't completely understand everything that's going on around him. I really enjoyed that aspect of the story because it's so different from so many other books out there, expecially other John Grisham books. If you just read Grisham for the lawyers and courtroom antics, you won't want to read this book, but if you want to read an excellent book, I truly recommend this one.$LABEL$1

Awful. This is just an awful edition, full of errors. There are clef signs missing, misplaced accidentals galore. Some of the errors I can correct, because there are two choices and one doesn't sound right. But this is extremely complex music -- all of Iberia is -- and in some cases, it's difficult to know what Albeniz actually wrote. I bought this because I was frustrated by the difficulty these days of obtaining piano scores (Patelson's in New York and Yesterday Service in Cambridge, MA, two of my favorites, are now closed). A mistake. Now I will try a little harder and get myself a real edition. It makes no sense to devote the time and effort to learning music as difficult as this from a (very) substandard edition.$LABEL$0

why do they all have to go "commercial". Unfortunately with this album Beenie Man shows us that his work is evolving in the wrong direction. Whereas his earliest albums still have the wicked Kingston, Jamaica sound and rhytm, this album has moved to the ranks of a computer generated song, with all of the beats that seem so out of place in this song. This might attract a bigger audience (and thus more sales), he'd be wise to stick to his roots$LABEL$0
Will giving a review of a non-existent item help it exist?. I hope so! I loved this show, and I would buy this DVD set in a heartbeat, and I have never purchased a tv series on DVD. DVD's are so cheap to make, why wouldn't they take a shot, and make some money off this show?$LABEL$1
An Important First Step. This is an important study of the responses of Assyrian immigrants and their children to their newfound land of freedom and its lure for assimilation. The vibrant Assyrian community of Chicago has maintained its strong cultural identity, as the author asserts through a superb pictorial essay, by slowly shedding the social distinctions brought from homeland.While the author ignores the tumulus years following the great exodus of 1980's due to the Iran-Iraq War & the Islamic Revolution in Iran, his study of the cultural activities between 1930's and 1960's would be interesting to most readers - particularly those with ties to Chicago.Since the politics of the "Chicagoland" continue to affect Assyrian-American politics in general, Mr. Shoumanov's book is an important first step in the contextualization of the Assyrian experience in America.$LABEL$1

An eye openning account about the war on drugs.. Let me say that this book was read before I had a chance to see a video titled the Clinton chronicles.

I recommend this book, and I recommend getting your hands on the video. You'll be amazed.$LABEL$1
A look into first-time motherhood through int'l adoption. This book is one single woman's story of international adoption and her journey from singledom to motherhood.

I found this to be an interesting, easy read.$LABEL$1
Doesn't quite cut it. "Coyote" was an impulse buy, and the "steal a starship" set-up was so contrived and preposterous that I almost gave up on the book - Amazon reviewers suggested I hold on for the Coyote part, which WAS a lot better, and I finally enjoyed the book enough to try this sequel.Although these stories are well crafted and generally connected to the rebellion plot in a "life on the hard frontier" context, they often felt more like writing exercises to me, especially the one about a bio-engineered bat/man vampire dude who arrives on Coyote leading his religious cult (as if someone said "I challenge you to write a Coyote story involving a vampire" - this is hard SF?!?). This book seems more like a Wild West story set on another planet, with rugged freedom-loving rebels fighting the oppressive, power-hungry socialist overlords. But there are weird animals and plants, and some strangely selective advanced technology thrown in for good measure. And a vampire. Oy.$LABEL$0
NOTHING LIKE THIS BOOK OUT THERE. A brilliant collection of prose and poetry on the mystery of art and art-making, this book is not only moving but also powerful and engaging. The selections are beautifully varied from what were originally reviews in art magazines to poetic musings by acclaimed poets, diary-like entrees and studio interviews with artists wrestling with pictorial problems. Sitting down with this book is like an aesthetic journey, and rising up again one feels strangely refreshed and revitalized. It is a wonderful book and a treasure trove of insights and revelations on art and creative living. William J. Havlicelk PhD$LABEL$1
Great printer. Great buy.. Did a lot of research before I bought this printer. Even called Canon for a definition of some of the features I didn't understand and received quick, friendly help. Then I searched the Internet for best price. This was it. Printer arrived in 3 days. Easy to install. Weighs about half what my old one did. Works like a champ. If most of your printing/copying/faxing is black and white, get this printer with a cheap color printer for the occasional item you need in color. Much cheaper way to operate.$LABEL$1
Hypnotic. I began reading with WWI and continued to the end, and now I look forward to starting again with the Greeks. The most astonishing conjunction is the torture of Eric Lomax and his mates, followed immediately by Bill Laurence's account of the Nagasaki bombing. Whatever pity you might otherwise have felt for the Japanese on the ground has been utterly extinguished by the cruelty of the Japanese army in action. A superlative collection. The dustjacket photo alone speaks eloquently of vulnerability of men at war.$LABEL$1

Ditto. Sadly, I must support the opinions of the reviewer who preceded me here. If you want to get into this material, you need to go with the recordings by the original ensemble prior to their break-up in the mid-30s. There are two or three tracks of interest here, but unfortunately the disc overall is a pale, limp imitation of past glory. I'm still looking around for a desirable first choice, but while I can't offer a positive recommendation at this point I can definitely second the notion that this is one to avoid.$LABEL$0
I know how to Cook Non-allergenic food like Speghetti & Grits - Nothing amazing at all about the recipes.

Just a pretty face. I bought this stroller because I couldn't afford a Bugaboo and because it looks really cool. The fabrics are really hip and the overall look is stylish. But it was not worth it! I have been disappointed by this stroller again and again. It is bulky, not travel-friendly. I was excited about the flipping handle, but it doesn't push well at all in that position because the wheels rub against the basket. It's really cumbersome to lift over curbs and is rather difficult to maneuver in general.Even with those drawbacks I figured I would keep it and just get a cheap umbrella stroller for travel, but today i was out with it and a bolt fell out of the frame, making it impossible to push up over curbs! I had to carry my 17 pounder 8 blocks home dragging the worthless thing behind me. I'm getting a Graco and hope I am never taken in by looks again!$LABEL$0

Period piece from a bad period. This film was silly and dumb the day it came out, and it remains so today, even given the nostalgic smirk that it will conjure up from most of its viewers. The eighties was a time of teen dance movies, and this one cashes in as best it can. A reviewer below is right to point out that the premise of a town that outlaws dancing is utterly ridiculous. (Perhaps had the film been set in the late 1600s it would have been believable, but then they wouldn't have been able to sell the cheesy pop soundtrack.) Along comes the inevitable good-looking rebel to shake things up with his slinky moves. As a period piece, this formulaic eighties film might be good for a few warm guffaws. Otherwise it's pretty insipid, and holds up even less well than many Elvis movies from the sixties.$LABEL$0
should have listened to the other reviews :-(. by far the worst purchase I have ever made! now you CAN make it eat some putty, the problem is it will also eat the wood. it is meant to act as a "bearing bit" that follows along the wood. BUT the surface you are bearing against is the putty it self. Therefore you have to "free hand" into the putty to create a bearing surface on the wood, of course you will most likely nic or even destroy the side of the wood in so doing. and once you do get to the wood the ... oh never mind I hope you get the point by now.$LABEL$0
Wow.. This is one incredible album. The progress silverchair has made in 4 years is astonishing. It's hard to believe these guys are only 19. It's so obvious how much these songs mean to them, especially Daniel- you can hear the emotion in his voice and in the very personal lyrics. There is an incredible amount of diversity here, something which is getting harder to find. And all the songs are just as powerful live. If an album this good can come from silverchair at 19, imagine what's coming in the future.$LABEL$1

Nothing's Perfect, but this is close.... I am a fan of all types of music...I saw the Video of "Daddy Won't Sell The Farm" on TV and knew I had to have the CD...Their clear, true voices can bring you to tears (Tattoos & Scars) and their harmonies and band are superb...You can pump it up on all of the tracks or turn it soft to get a different feeling on all the songs...most "hard-core" Country fans probably think it is "too rock"...just the combination I like...Favorites are "Tattoos & Scars" (thoughtful); "Hillbilly Shoes" and "Daddy Won't Sell The Farm" (good pump up the sound and stomp yer shoes)!$LABEL$1

A wonderful documentary:. If you are a fan of Hunter S. Thompson you will love this movie.The archival footage is extraordinary,and the interviews are great. Johnny Depp does top notch narration as Hunter.By the end of this movie, you really get a feel for the man that was Hunter S. Thompson. This was a very deep and moving experience.Even the soundtrack is flawless!(CCR, Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, etc...)The special features are also superb, with commentary, a music video,audio excerpts,extended interviews,deleted scenes, all the "gonzo" art,and even a photo gallery, plus more.If you like Hunter, then this is a no-brainer purchase.I plan to also buy the soundtrack,audio tapes,and books.Happy "Gonzo" watching.$LABEL$1
Not Worthy. This deserves DVD treatment? First of all, I object to the term "pimp" being used as a verb. It's just not right. Some of what they do with the cars is amazing...but I wonder why they don't just get better cars to work with. If you rebuild an old piece of junk, you could get problems down the road. For all it must cost to redo the cars, they may as well just buy new ones (I suspect they do anyway, as some of the "improvements" are too hard to believe).I miss the days when MTV played music videos.$LABEL$0
Michael Phelps inside story. This is an amazing video. If you watched just one of his races, you must see this DVD. His story is great AND they show every race he did.

Beautifully disturbing. This album is a bit of a contrast on Mer de Noms, but it is a very good thing. The musics' complexity and depth makes this a great album without Maynard.

Will not charge anymore in my Nikon charger!. I purchased one of these batteries so that I could have an extra for my Nikon Coolpix 4300. I charged it successfully a few times and it seemed to be working fine at first. Now when I try to charge it with my Nikon charger, the light blinks rapidly. The Nikon instruction manual suggests that when this happens, it indicates there's a problem (as in - the battery may be unable to charge). My original Nikon battery still charges normally with no problems and everything works as it should. I don't know if I just got a bad battery or whether this is a very common problem. Just be aware that this could happen to you!$LABEL$0
Works Great. Very pleased with this one. I was a bit apprehensive over using a hard metal cuticle pusher, but the Tweezerman pusher worked great. It even gets the tough cuticle underneath.

Big Disappointment. I have been a HUGE fan of Godsmack since the very beginning. They are a truly talented band, and one of my top 5 favorite bands. However, I sure am glad that I only paid the special Amazon price of $8.96, instead of a normal CD price. 'IV' is a classic example of a popular band that has a magical musical formula for success, and that formula has worked for them on all of their past CD's, and then they decide, "Hey, let's experiment and try something different since we are famous and everyone will buy it, even if they don't care for it, we'll still make millions." Of course, Sully's voice is awesome as always, and the musicianship is top notch. 'Speak' is classic killer Godsmack, and 'Temptation' runs a close second. However, they need 9 new tracks to complete the CD. I'll save 'Speak' and 'Temptation' to my computer and MP3 player, but the CD will get buried in some cabinet, and I will anxiously await their next release, which hopefully will revert back to the magic formula!$LABEL$0
Profiling and Finding a Wife. The author in this second book of the Millionaire series offers up some new interesting insights about wealthy people and thier ways. Unfortunately he maintains his bias against working folks read "economic dropouts" and this time there is a lamentable self-congratulatory tone. I would like to see a book that looks at wealthy people from every segment of society and every economic background. This book is written for middle to upper middle class white college educated people who perhaps have money problems. I strongly suspect the author has little use for any other kind of people hence the pejorative "economic dropout". If the potential reader fits the above described profile and wants to get married then this book might be a good read. This time I was smart and checked it out from the library.$LABEL$0
Ridiculous. Ok people.. there are actually two bolts that hold your rack together. Why would this lock make your rack secure? Any idiot could just unscrew the other bolt and get anything you had on your rack plus most of the rack itself. This product is completely ridiculous. The design of this bike rack is very lacking. They should design the rack with security in mind and not charge extra for it. Seriously.. isnt that part of their job? Who would want to buy a rack that is easy to steal? If you bought this rack then you are much better off just using a chain and a decent lock to chain it all together and chain it down to your hitch.$LABEL$0
Great First Safety Razor. Compared to my old Mach 3, this is easily a five star product.Cons:- However, compared to other safety razors, it lacks an adjustable angle. This wasn't a problem for me just starting out, but I'm now considering branching out into more adaptable razors.Pros:- It delivers on the longer handle, though it turns out I grip it pretty close to the blade anyway.- I've had mine for 2 years without the breaks described in other reviews. *fingers crossed*All in all, it's been a transformative shaving experience. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to switch to safety razors that has large hands.$LABEL$1
Cliche's Made Palatable for Middle America. I have an idea. Let's take as many gay cliche's as we can possibly put together in 3 amazingly short segments. Oh wait, we don't have to, it's all here in "Common Ground". In the 3rd, 30 minute sement alone we have veterens protesting a gay wedding ceremony, the military dad who doesn't approve, one of the groom-to-be about to run away cause he's unsure, two lesbian caterers, the straight supportive female friend, the gay florist, a third lesbian who is getting sperm from the other groom-to-be to inseminate her on his wedding day and a priest who is rethinking the church's stance on homosexuality. I haven't met all of these citizens of the gay world in my 26 years as an out gay male much less in 30 minutes.I'm all for gay representation in any form, but this is not a flick for the gay community. It is clearly intended for middle american to gain an (unrealistic) glimpse into "those crazy gays and their antics".$LABEL$0
The Epic Poem of the English Language. John Milton's "Paradise Lost" is one of the all-time classics of English literature. The epic poem begins with Satan just having been expelled from Heaven. Adam and Eve are tempted in the Garden of Eden, and fall. Before the two are expelled from Eden, Adam has revealed to him some of the major events of the Old and New Testaments, culminating in the Second Coming of Christ. The epic has enthralled readers for well over three centuries.One thing that must be borne in mind when reading this work is that Milton's theology was not orthodox Christian theology, but Arianism, as he denied the Trinity and believed that Christ was not eternal, but created by God the Father. Also, the seventeenth century English is difficult to plow through. However, by forcing the reader to reflect on the origin of evil and to consider what they believe about the concept of original sin, "Paradise Lost" proves to be worth the effort one must make in reading it.$LABEL$1

Title is the only thing interesting about this book. Regionalism across the North South Divide is not for the novice reader. This book is a compilation of case studies from several authors and is very difficult to read. This book is nothing but fact after fact on several different countries. The writers present an entire idea in one sentence and move to the next idea, without allowing the reader to digest the information already presented. It is a shame this book is so poor because I am interested in the subject but don't feel I gained anything from this book. I would have given it one star but made it two because it does contain a lot of facts in relation to globalization in lesser-developed countries. The editors condensed way too much information into this book and lost the free-flow of thoughts and ease of comprehension. I would not recommend this book to anyone.$LABEL$0

Well, I'll try not to make this a biased comment, only because I'm a huge HIM fan, and their music is probably the most down to earth stuff my ears get to catch.The acoustic version of "The Funeral of Hearts" is incredible, along with "Buried Alive by Love." You can really hear Vallo giving his all to both of those, and not to mention the Apocalyptica hauntings in "Gone With the Sin." Definitely worth buying, and a must-have for anyone who liked even one song of His Infernal Majesty.$LABEL$1
sorry to disagree. I'm sorry to disagree with all the positive reviews, but even though I usually like wild juxtapositions like this, I don't find this pairing at all successful. The whole CD reeks of the editing room, with the music of Bach being performed throughout in a stiff, stilted manner in order to synchronize with the African rhythms. All I could think about was the singers with headphones on in a recording studio trying to cram Bach's fluid phrases into the rhythmic straitjacket of the drum tracks. The 3-part invention is played on (or rather programmed into) an electronic keyboard with an ugly fake organ sound - why not have a real organist play it on a real organ? And the clapping overlaid on Bach's sublime "Ruht wohl" is just lame! I can't speak to the authenticity of the African element of this CD, but as a classical musician I can tell you that the classical element is severely compromised - even rendered lifeless - by the pairing.$LABEL$0
WOW, Everyone Needs To Read This Book!. This book has it all! It was entertaining, thought provoking & enlightening. Make sure that you have some time to read when you pick this book up. You won't want to put it down once you get started!$LABEL$1
Love her books!. I love her books but since I have Nook and not the Kindle i have to use them on my computer. this one will not convert over to a working Nook book for some reason. Some of them are copyrighted and you can't do that anyway but this one particularly stops at 47% and won't go any further. Sure wish I could read it on my Nook instead of the computer.$LABEL$1
Great book to record all your memories!!!. I love this book! You can record all the stages of your relationship from courtship, engagement to your wedding.

Great Double Duty Product. My nail technician trains others in OPI products and uses them exclusively on my nails. I normally get a french manicure (gel) on my nails with OPI products once every 4 or 5 weeks. Just recently I started painting my own nails in between my manicures and have been getting amazing results with the Start-to-Finish.Using it as a base coat assures that the color doesn't bleed into the edges of my manicure (for when I want to go back to just the white tips) and also helps the color adhere well. My technician did tell me that this base coat does adhere better to gel nails than bare ones, if that helps. She also highly recommended that I do just three swipes (center, and each edge) with each coat. Over-painting with each coat can cause some of the problems people have with chipping.Once I have my nails painted, top coated, and completely dry, I can get at least a week without chipping. I even went on a camping/backpacking adventure and did not end up with a single chip.$LABEL$1
Pretty good ice trays. I got these ice trays to use when the ice maker went out of my refriderater. The trays worked very well but I had a hard time gtting the cubes to fall out. Still a very good product though.$LABEL$1
This is a "have to read" story!!. I just finished this and all that I can say is... WOW!! I am completely blown away by this story. It grabbed me right away and I never had trouble getting into the story or following it. This author is an amazing talent!! The love of Henry and Clare is so heartwrenching and so touching. Many times, thoughout the book, I would stop and just think to myself - what if something like this were to really happen - can you imagine?! Beginning, middle and end - the entire novel was just unbelievable. I will be recommending this to everyone!! Definitely a permenant bookshelf book! For those unsure of the idea of reading a time traveling book - do not hesitate on this one! I was unsure if I would enjoy this book, before I read it, just because I am not one to really get into the whole genre/idea of time travel. However, the way this is written - so beautifully and engrossing - I am so glad that I took the chance on it!!! I can't wait to read more by this author!$LABEL$1
twice the movie that new jack city is!. This is the movie that type-cast the careers of christopher walkin,,larry fishburne and david caruso.All these actors would go onto careers that would see them essentially reprise their roles so capably deliniated in this seminal flick.If you want a good action flick that's a favorite with every body who's ever seen it,this is one that people memorise.$LABEL$1
IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE. It makes me cry, and laugh, and think, and notice that my thinking start to change. I feel much more at peace and happy. I am so thankful that Mr. Walsh decided to write this book. Many times, I have sincerely prayed to Buddha to show me the way to truth. And my prayers have been answered. I stumbled on this book when I was in the book store to buy another book. And I almost didn't go to the bookstore. The truth and God do not belong to any one particular religion. This book speaks of that truth. The self-rightious and close-minded will not agree with it. But be patient, they will find their ways eventually. May be not this life time, but they will.$LABEL$1

A Little Gem I Have Gone Too Long Without. I read first read this book in its orignal edition nearly eight years ago following a workshop by E. Timothy Burns. While the writing itself is average, the content and the weaving of human aspect that creates resilient children is elegantly and simply presented. Having loaned (many times) and finally lost my original copy, I am getting myself another! This is both an inspirational and referential text. It is a little gem I have gone too long without. Any family with children, anyone working with children or adult-children, or those called upon to opine about growing up in an often harsh world should read, keep, reread, and reference this book. It is, as I have said, a little gem.$LABEL$1
Good for people who don't have internet access. This is a good strategy book for someone with no internet access. Oh wait, Dark Age of Camelot can only be played by people that have net access! D'oh!There are numerous web sites with more accurate, up-to-date information. Particularly in a game such as this which is being patched and changed constantly, a paper guide has limited value. Especially when the paper guide contains factual errors and bad character development advice.In my experience, the only truely useful part of this book is the bestiary. It's handy to have and seems to be pretty accurate and comprehensive.If you're too lazy to go online and find the information go ahead and buy this book but be advised of its limitations.$LABEL$0
Working well after I fixed existing wiring. I bought this PE120 to replace an older one of the same model that had been declared bad and disposed of before I moved in (thus before I could look at it). When I first installed the new one, the alarm sounded continuously - I then discovered a wire had dislodged from the connector originally installed in the ceiling.After repairing the connector the alarm tests fine and we've had no problems, no false alarms. My anecdote of course doesn't prove anything, but does make me wonder what other variables may have been involved in others' experiences with this model.$LABEL$1

Great product but not at this price. I purchased this product directly from Amazon at a cost of under six dollars, and have reviewed it on Amazon. It works very well, and I gave it five stars.The reason for this one star review is to prevent an unsuspecting consumer from purchasing this product from a seller who is currently charging five times as much as Amazon for the exact same thing.$LABEL$0
To large. I got this product and when I opened it I realized this was going to be to big and bulky for me. I have short, curly and thick hair. I sent it back right away and I never did recieve my refund. However, I did complain this to Amazon and they took care of the problem right away, I should be refuned in 10 days or so.

Effective of Methioform for managing UTI in cats. My cat since when she was very young has had a recurring tendency to develop Urinary Tract Infection. On our Vet's recommendation, I put her on half a tab of methioform daily to change the PH of her urine. This has been very effective in keeping the UTI at bay. Methioform also has the advantage of being very palatable for cats; my cat, who is very bad with medication usually just happily munches it up with her dry biscuits. I would recommend this as a good way of preventing a nasty and troublesome problem. I am writing from outside of the US; I had trouble purchasing methioform from a few websites, particularly Animal Meds sites because they require prescriptions. I was able to buy it at Amazon with no hassles.$LABEL$1

BUGS IN and BUGS GETTING OUT. Not only did I have many of the same problems as already described, but had problems UNINSTALLING this junk. Manual(a joke) says "insert nero6 CD into drive" then click on "next to continue uninstalling"After putting disk in drive to uninstall, it would only install.Had to use XP's "Add or remove Programs". Even that left alot of nero6 in system. Had to do search "nero", and drag to recycle bin. Last search nero6 is gone from my system?Besides many problems, much of advertised stuff is not there. Looking at positive and negative reviews here, there must be two different packages. You will be lucky to get the right one. Big waste of money.$LABEL$0

Boring. This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. The attempt to mix the author's life (her mother's dementia) with one of her interests (Art at The Hermitage) is a debacle. Sometimes, two totally different things compliment each other: vinegar and oil. In this case, they do not. This was contrived and unnecessary . The endless effort to seem intellectual, and the author's decision to bring the outcome in the middle of the book are two of the many things that spelled disaster. I do not recommend this book.$LABEL$0

Fast and beautifully done.. I loved this movie, from beginning to end.First there was Bruce Lee, now we have Ip Man or Donnie Yen. The action thriller not only tells the peril of the Japanese occupation in China but also the brutality of fighting and warring, which China has experienced for quite a long time.It is fun, touching, and a wonderful story about the art of Wing Chun.$LABEL$1
Rolli is Best. This is the best cat box we have ever had for our family of cats. They love the priacy and we love the ease of cleaning the box each week.$LABEL$1
This is really great. We've used two of these for about a year and a half. It takes about 20 seconds to clean each one. Our cats are fussy and demand that we clean the boxes frequently, so these are perfect for us. The type of litter does matter, some clumping better than others. We use the Arm & Hammer clumping litter (multi-cat), and little to no clean letter gets stuck in the waste drawer. It's quick, litter efficient, and doesn't make a mess. It is hard to imagine it wearing out very easily since it is such a simple construction. We love it (if you can love a litter box).$LABEL$1
WHAT HAPPENED TO METALLICA???????????????????????????. No Joke, this is one of the worst albums EVER!!!!!!!!! I just cannot believe my ears.

Hurts like the dickens. I got these to exercise with and found the sound to be good. Not as good as my in-ear Shures, but good.The problem is that the fit is horrible. The sit in your ear at an angle that makes the front of my ear start to hurt within 5 minutes and the pressure inward from the headand is significant making the center of your ear hurt within 15 minutes.My head is not that large, but the at-rest width of these headphones is like 5 inches. They don't work for me. Thankfully, they were cheap.$LABEL$0
I've continually had problems with deodorants that are .... I've continually had problems with deodorants that are too harsh for my sensitive skin.

Just another win in the Zelda line.... I am a huge fan of the Zelda games and this one definitely didn't let me down. The graphics are great and being able to use the wii controllers to play really steps it up a notch. Swinging the sword to hit enemies is an awesome touch. The special moves that are learned throughout the game are pretty cool as well. If you are a fan of any of the Zelda games, or even if you have never played one but like adventure, I would definitely recommend this. It is not a let down in the least.$LABEL$1
It didn't top the original, but that's a hard act to follow.. Still a great movie and for $2.99 it is a steal. I watched all 4 movies with the family at $2.99 Amazon streaming and then went to the theater and watched the new one. Time well spent.$LABEL$1

Too scratchy to wear for even a short time!. I really should have believed other reviews, but I frequently wear wool and can deal with it just fine. NOT so with these.

I can't recommend them. i should have returned them, but I assume the return shipping fee would make that hardly worth the time.$LABEL$0
This guy makes Deion Sanders look like a chump!. This is truly a player for all ages, and why football "back then" is soooo much better than football today. He did it all. Play the run, play the pass, hit . .you name it. Jack Tatum let his actions on the field speak for itself. And he didnt get caught up in "marketing himself" on the field after a good play either (ala "Deion"). Knowing how brutal the old Raiders clubs were in the 60's & 70's, and to a man, having all of them agree that Jack Tatum was the toughest of all of them (Ken Stabler in "Snake" and John Madden's books for just a couple of examples), this tells you just how good of a football player this guy was. The fact that he loved and respected Woody Hayes at Ohio State for just being always "honest and upfront with him," when all other college recruiters were trying to buy him out of high school, showed me just what kind of character this guy was made of. A good read.$LABEL$1
hype. Bought new ear piece for new ipod. Had Koss plugs. Panasonics are awful. Tried all the sizes. Guess I don't have the right ears for these.Koss plugs are great. Reverted back to them and have no desire to upgrade after hearing Panasonics. Are the Sony look alikes any better???$LABEL$0
Yer Mom. This book sucks. I read this book in class and it made me fall asleep because nobody cared about this cancer girl. It is very confusing because it kept repeating details about the character, Bluish. It didn't stay on topic. It's so corny. Virginia Hamilton--her books are boring. I couldn't connect to this book mentally. This book shouldn't even get one star.$LABEL$0
Brilliant and Provocative. This is a beautifully written, mesmerizing story about people I came to care about (to the point of aching) by the time I reached its emotional, powerful ending. It is riveting. It is not like any book I have read before--and I have read a few! The plot is unique and intriguing. The characters come together in an incredible situation, all at odds, but by the dramatic ending, they are dancing together in a fine and beautiful waltz. But the ball must end, and when it does, I was left stunned. It is not overly graphic in its sexuality or violence, and yet it manages to evoke strong emotions from the reader. It is romantic, riveting, personal, and spellbinding. Something here for everyone.$LABEL$1
Great for a basic intro or advanced practicioners. If you don't know who Kelly Worden is then it's about time you find out. I just attended his 2009 Water & Steel seminar near Tacoma, Washington. It changed my life. This video is quite old now and Mr. Worden has progressed a great deal since the time it was made. However, it lays out his methods well. Training in his garage converted dojo, he shows you how to completely dismantle your opponent. He employs a no-nonsense, down and dirty, in your face approach. His material is geared for real-life situations wherever they may occur, in the street, bar, your home, anywhere. I highly recommend this video to everyone. Look him up on the net for many more excellent videos.$LABEL$1
Amazing album. I really enjoyed Infest, and Lovehatetragedy, but this album surpasses them both by miles, well written lyrics, full of hard rocking energy, improved vocals, and all the members got better at playing their instruments. Best songs on the album would be Scars, Sometimes, Do or Die, Getting Away With Murder, Be Free, Take Me, Done With You, Blood, and Tyranny of Normality. They're all great songs, most of them I consider best songs, be sure to get this album, don't miss out!$LABEL$1
Nice iPod Speakers - Makes a small "hum". I've enjoyed the iPod speakers. It came with different adapters to plug in various iPod types and it fit the ones we had. It also came with a cord to plug into the headphone jack of other mp3 players that aren't compatible with the iPod dock.The sound is great and the volume is loud enough.The only problem is that when the music is not playing and the device is left on, we can hear a little "hum" that is annoying enough to catch our attention and go over and unplug the speakers from the power source.Other than that, it's been a great product.$LABEL$1
curious. i really wanted to buy this one but the problem is i am curious on where this camera is made. it is not written in the product specs & in the 'see it in action' part, it cannot be tilted downward so that i can see whether its made in u.s. or japan etc. i dont want to end up buying something that is made in china.$LABEL$0
It's Defective. My mandolin looked fine when I got it, but the strings started breaking when I tried to tune it. I took it to a music store and they said the neck is warped. I had already thrown away all the paperwork, so now I have to figure out how to send it back. Keep your paperwork and packing materials until you're sure it's okay.$LABEL$0
No complaints about the content…. I've got no quarrel with the content. But the format of this single volume edition is difficult to use. The pages are onion-skin so there is some bleed through of the opposite page. Worse, the book doesn't lay flat and the contents curve towards the spine where it is very difficult to read. This is a case where a larger page width would have helped by allowing a more generous inner margin.If you struggle with this and twist and bend the book, you'll find excellent introductions and explanatory material. I'd like to see these plays released in individual titles with a better margin and thicker paper.$LABEL$1
Algebra 2 Work Sheet Companion. Has to be purchased and used with Mathtutor Alg. 2 dvd which is very good. The Algebra 2 Worksheet Companion is perfect for summer preview or review. The number of problems per section does not exceed 14-15 so don't be daunted. And the problems are easy, focusing on basic principles not gotcha questions.I've used Mathtutor dvd's on my son for Algebra, Precalc & Trig, Chemistry and Physics. They calm him down and reassure him that his class is doable. Maybe your son or daughter doesn't have a five star lecturer for a teacher like Jason Gibson, in that case these dvd's are really golden.My son scored well using the Mathtutor dvd's and, by doing every single problem he could get his hands on from whatever source.$LABEL$1

I used to liked this song, and man..... It's understandable, how the CD, Radio, and T.V. changed my mind. IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE!! He has a pretty lame flow, but the beat was nice, but now I'm sick of it in all places possible. Everytime I hear it I get away from it as soon as possible. My friends hated 50 cent from day 1. Well, I used to say screw them, but now I'm like screw 50. I just can't stand him anymore, and now I don't even listen to his CD anymore. Overplaying of this CD, just made me felt like I wasted money on it, but at least I enjoyed it, until the raido played his hits out.$LABEL$0

Imagine my surprise one day when I idly tried some of the exercises and they WORKED.

Pretty much all you could ask. This is really an excellent book for a woodworker seeking guidance with the particular challenges of chairbuilding.Most chapters cover some particular chair of the author's creation. Don't worry about whether Miller's designs will appeal or not. Plans are included, but copying them really isn't the point. They're presented here as case studies in conceptualization and construction, with lessons that are widely applicable. For example, how to accurately lay out and cut angled tenons, how to obtain a flat surface on an otherwise curved leg, how to fashion a slip seat, etc. And throughout, Miller details a bunch of clever jigs and methods of work.A caution: familiarity with the ABCs of furnituremaking and access to some modicum of shop stuff is assumed here. This isn't a beginning woodworking text, which only makes sense, given the subject.$LABEL$1

Doug Supernaw at his finest. This album runs the gamut of styles, from the heart wrenching tune "Wilting Rose" to the Cajun flavor of "Drove me to Drinkin'" this album is Doug at his finest. "Wilting Rose" and "Fadin Renegade" brings to mind the great country singers like George Jones while songs like "Nothing sure looked good on you" show Doug can make a play on words that is second to none. After listening to this disc for the second time, I was singing along like I had had this disc for years.$LABEL$1
Great way to increase your fruits and vegetables. I have been using this product for about three weeks now in my smoothies. I don't use it often enough to have noticed any substantial change in my health as other people have stated, but it is definitely a quick and easy way to increase my daily intake of "fruits and vegetables." I put it in all of my smoothies, from banana to berry and everything in between, and can't even taste it. It does affect the color of the smoothie, as it is green, but as long as that doesn't bother you (and I don't know why it would) it's a great nutritional addition.$LABEL$1
Save your money. I recently purchased this book and it did not take long to realize I had wasted my money. This book is so outdated that much of the information does not apply.

Weakest battery I have ever seen. Not a bad razor as far as the shaving goes, but the battery is just awful.

This is a surprisingly bad battery for a reputable company like Philips.$LABEL$0
good switch, but really that necessary?. My place is pretty small and I just needed a switch to get my computer and laptop doing at the same time.

Meets my needs completely. It's been quite a while since my old belt sander gave up the ghost and I've been trying to make due with a DeWalt palm sander. I finally broke down, however, and after having read the reviews here on Amazon.com, decided to buy the Bosch belt sander. The package was shipped promptly and arrived in good order and I have to say that I was impressed the first time I used it to fashion a new threshhold. The belt tracked well and the dust bag actually did what it was supposed to do. I would recommend this item to anyone.$LABEL$1

hatred, not history. How, in these PC days, did this book ever get published? The constant bashing of Christians isn't just offensive, it's factually incorrect in so many ways. The author belittles the great of accomplishes of many who were motivated by faith, and in general is utterly scornful of her subjects.It's one thing to present the negative truths of history, slavery really did happen, but quite another to present it in its most brutal and ugly forms IN A CHILDREN'S BOOK.The writer clearly has personal problems dealing with those of the Christian faith, be they living or dead, and treats her reads with a patronizing scorn as well as her subjects. I'm glad I read this before my son saw it - I try to teach him to look at BOTH sides of a story, something the author fails to do in her rush to condemn the great explorers of history. I call them great not for their treatment of human beings, but for the way they pushed human knowledge far beyond its previous boundaries.$LABEL$0
A Wonderful Book -- highly recommend!!!. I think this is a wonderful book. While it might be a cliche, I "felt like I was there" much of the time while I was reading. It is obvious that a lot of research went into this book, and the book is written in a very engaging style. The author is a fantastic story teller, and that is definitely part of the book's charm. I felt like I actually got to know the men in theregiment as I read about what happened to them during the four year struggle. To make a long story short, I love reading about the Civil War and I loved reading this book.$LABEL$1

The most AMAZING soap for sensitive skin. Length:: 3:04 MinsThis is my video review about Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap, which I absolutely love!-It is great for my sensitive skin(I bought a whole SLEW of products from Sephora especially for sensitive skin (DermaDoctor, I think and others), but none of them worked for me.)-I can use this on my face and my body with glowing results-I always have to wear make up, but when I started using this, I went without make up for a while bc my skin looked so good!-It is tingly and it feels SO refreshing-You can take a "quick" shower with this by putting water in a bowl, adding a little Dr. B's soap, dipping in a washcloth and wiping yourself off - save water, save time :-) - then wipe the soap off with the wash cloth and some water ;]- I believe they support efforts to INFORM consumers and encourage honest labeling on food, based on my research -- another reason to buy and support Dr. Bronner's!$LABEL$1

Consistently Good. Fringe has been consistently good throughout it's run and the 5th season is not different. It does suffer a bit from aimlessness as wanders towards it's final conclusion. A lot of very interesting storylines are only touched on briefly and then left by the wayside in favor of plot advancement.$LABEL$1
Another 'cut-and-paste' book. The title is misleading. It should have been "You are not responsible! A guide for all you poor victimized women who wants to set that bastard husband strait (and lets face it, it's ALL his fault anyway). And lets not forget those horrible parents either, AND your siblings, AND everyone else.."I guess that title would not have fit on the cover :-) At least it would have been more telling...Codependency IS a real issue, and it deserves better coverage that this. It really is just a collage of texts taken from other, and better, books.$LABEL$0
Keep coming back to this Tosca. This was the first Tosca I every bought (about 15 years ago), probably because I could afford any of the other lavishly-packaged recordings. Since then, I have collected many of the others, including the Caballe set, which is wonderful, Freni's two recordings, Gheorghiu, Vaness, Price and even a rare recording by Anna Moffo. However, I keep coming back to this Nelly Miricioiu Tosca on Naxos. Miricioiu gives us a solid performance with her glorious vocal tone, and the rest of the cast is of a really good standard. It's such a pity that Miricioiu didn't record more in her career. Don't let the fact that it's a Naxos recording put you off buying this set. They have produced some of the most outstanding operas (Tancredi, Zauberflote, Sonnambula are all worth it).$LABEL$1
Awesome knife. Watch out....it is super sharp!. I just completed my Henckel set with this knife and wish I had not waited so long. The blade is awesome. I highly recommend this knife to anyone needing something of size.$LABEL$1
R.I. P. Roger. Man Zapp and Roger was bad back in the day discovered by legendary funk bassist Bootsy Collins and blessed to give up the funk by George Clinton himself all his best stuff is on here even some stuff in the 70's when his group was called the human body. Roger like Clinton, bootsy, and James brown was sampled to death over the years. And plus Roger worked with a lot of popular artists such as Eazy E, 2pac, Dr. Dre, H town, Shirley Murdock, Johnny Gill, Ahmad, The Click, Snoop Dogg, Rappin 4tay, Spice1, e40, and many others. This is bad if you love zapp and roger and miss him like his true fans do buy it. We still bouncin Roger.$LABEL$1
Good Read. I like King, and this is one of his better ones. Not quite as good as The Stand or Hearts in Atlantis, but close. When it boils right down to it, it's a love story, and one that has a smidge of Nicholas Sparks. There was only one part I had some trouble with and that was believing the whole world of Boo ya Moon, an imaginary world that author Scott Landon often visits. If you can buy into this supernatural world, the story is perfect. Once I forced myself to care about it, I enjoyed it. Even if you don't, the story of Scott and Lisey's marriage makes it all worth it. By the time you finish with the book, you'll feel as if you know these two people, and you'll care very much about them.$LABEL$1
Awwsome.. when i read this book, i was so captured in the moment i didn't want to stop reading it. the author does an amazing job on bringing you into the scenes. I enjoyed this book so fondly, that i'm giving a presentation on it. I am usually a hard person to get to read, but this book was outstanding!$LABEL$1
NOT ARENA NFL!. When I played Kurt Warner Arena Football for the first time I was dissapointed because at first I thought It was going to be like a real arena football game like madden or gameday but to my suprise it was like blitz and nfl extreme so if you want to buy a real football game buy madden 2001!$LABEL$0
Misleading title - good sounding recipes.. I thought this cookbook would include recipes that only required one pan to make, ie "one dish meals". Unfortunately, this is not the case. Some of these recipes require a fry pan, two bowls and a pot to make. There are some good sounding recipes in here, but most require 10-15 ingredients (some exotic) and so require some planning (going to the store) and preparation. I think I am probably their target audience - I enjoy cooking but I don't have a lot of time - but I think they missed their target with this book.$LABEL$0
Love it!. I bought this CD on a whim and I could not have been happier with the result. I listen to it on a daily basis almost and even my 13 year old requests it, so is must not be untolerable. I hope Ms.Driver will be able to grace us with another release in the future.$LABEL$1
such a classic!. So fun to share with the new generation, especially with the recent Alvin and the Chipmunks movies that are so popular.$LABEL$1
Horrible Quality, Misleading Picture on Box. This toy was a huge disapointment. My father bought it for my daughter, who loves Strawberry Shortcake. We took it out of the box and set it up, but it kept falling apart. It comes in tons of tiny little pieces that you have to snap together, but the pieces fall apart at the slightest amount of pressure. My daughter ended up screaming with frustration. And it didn't come with all of the furniture shown on the box. Only the fireplace, armoire, and piano. We ended up superglueing the pieces together, and it now works enough to play with it, but for $40 I shouldn't have to doctor a toy to get it to work!$LABEL$0
Interesting book of celebrity death. I found myself hardly able to put this huge book down once I started it. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, some of the facts of the book are wrong, but overall I found it to be an interesting read. If you are into the true crime genre and are interested in celebrities, then this is the book for you! It proves also that just because you are rich and famous that doesn't exclude you from having something tragic and unexpected happen to you. Enjoy!$LABEL$1
WHACK... WHACK... WHACK... WHACK... if you like lots and lots of. spankings then this is the book for you. I didn't realize so much of the entire book was dedicated to the blow by blow descriptions of so many spankings. I will give it high marks for at least having an entertaining plot but it lacked depth, realism and true character development. But then again do any of these books really ever do that. No wonder Ann Rice is so appreciated.$LABEL$0

NOT Belkin, cheap knockoff made wrong!. This is not a genuine Belkin item, or at least it wasn't from the seller I purchased from.Here's what it does: it takes a stereo signal, dumps the right channel, replaces it with a copy of the left channel. AND ITS LIKE THAT ON BOTH OUTPUT JACKS!There's nothing weird about the shape or size, and it all plugs in completely, but totally screws up the audio channels.The NSI splitter I ordered from a different seller was very similar to this one, because it switched left/right channels. It was an obvious fake item too, not like their standard stuff.I'm getting real tired of all these bootleg, knockoff, cheap imitation, counterfeit cables! They're all being assembled in the dark!$LABEL$0

conspiracy of 9/11. This album was made july 2001 and was named I am the world trade center and the 11th song is called "September " and in there music video of "metro" it shows a weird thing in the sky then above buildings it makes it look like an explosion coincidence really I dont think so something is very strange here$LABEL$0
Biased book. The book is unfortunately highly biased and riddled with inaccuracies. Messori's book, on the other hand, provides a balanced and accurate representation of Opus Dei.$LABEL$0
DO NOT BUY-TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I bought this for my daughters birthday and when she tried it out it worked once and then quit. When I requested help from Kidco I got the response, sorry it's been over thirty days. I am a very unhappy customer and will NOT order from them again!!!$LABEL$0
Gerardo is back!. If you told me two weeks ago, I would never have thought that Gerardo would make a come back, but now it is obvious that this new album is going to be fantastic. Sigo Siende Rico has everything that made Gerardo a success ten years ago, but it is updated with the times and extremely innovantive. I could listen to this song over and over again. This cd is a must for dance and latin fans everywhere.$LABEL$1
Bob and Elton John. I just love this Bob the Builder Christmas special. It features guest star Elton John as part of the rock group Lenny and the Lasers and Bob's twin brother Tom. A fun movie!$LABEL$1
Great translation. This is one of the books I should have read ages ago but have never picked up. I first started to read a different translation, but the language and sentence structure gave it no narrative flow. The Buss translation is terrific. The adventure tale of wrongful imprisonment and revenge keeps you reading for long periods of time. A little history lesson about Napolean and the Borgias is painless and welcome. When we read older books we are reminded how little human emotions have changed over 200 years.This translation is highly recommended.$LABEL$1
cheapppp. i wanted a shower cd player so i bought this one. i would not recommend you buying it at all. it says its a shower cd player, but when it got wet the water got into the cd player, chorroding the batteries. then the batteries wouldnt work, so they leaked battery fluid, which leaked into the cd player and broke it. i only go to use it once, because once it got wet it broke. DO NOT BUY THIS. true its by far the cheapest one at $30, but its not even worth that.$LABEL$0
Does the job!. Bought the 6 liter for backpacking. Easy to fill and handle. Fabric seems extremely tough. It packs tight if you get any air compressed out of it. The various openings were useful though I don't think I have usd the 1/2-inch for much of anything. Perhaps my only objection is you must grab the base of the opening through the fabric with one hand while tightening the lid with the other. It is not a huge inconvenience, though, since I can still close it up with no spillage. I was worried about leaks on my first extended outing into the desert with it but I had no problems. Glad I have it!$LABEL$1
Sally Wright, please . . .. Sally Wright, you don't have to hit us over the head with a character's accent. I was so put off by "nevuh," "eithuh," etc. that I couldn't finish this book. All you have to do is say that one of your characters speaks with a soft Southern drawl and let your readers do the rest. In the previous Ben Reese mysteries, which I enjoyed for the most part, I got very tired of "a-tall," but I didn't quit reading. Not so with Out of the Ruins.$LABEL$0

A Well Done, Exciting, Middle Section To The Story. I am slowly but surely getting into the story, and yes, I'll eventually get through the trilogy.Just as in the first one, there are excellent visual effects and great acting.I do see many spiritual applications to this story.I'm looking forward to watching "Return of The King."One last comment: I loved the opening of this episode. Also, the ending has more suspense than the ending of "Fellowship Of The Ring".$LABEL$1
Love this episode!. This show is a good one for toddlers to watch, my 3 year old son loves it and I do not regret purchasing this video.Good for visits to the doctor or car rides.$LABEL$1
A Big Bag with Big Portions. I'll confirm this stuff tastes great (chocolate flavor). The bag is 12 pounds; however, you will run through this stuff very fast. The serving size is about 2 cups of powder. So be prepared to put a little water in a shaker at a time. I'd recommend using a blender for this stuff. When looking at this product I was hoping it would last a long time (because it was 12 pounds), even using half a serving size you'll go through it quick. However, it's great for bulking up!$LABEL$1
Great Design Poor Quality. I like this product features and design. It is filled with great features like dual alarm, graduated alarm, the ability to wake up with it playing a CD, dual brightness settings for the time. When I first got it, I rated it 5 stars. The problem is that if get this product don't expect it to be fully functional for very long. The first thing that will break will be the CD player and then you will gradually lose all functionality. If you want an alarm clock that will last for several years, do not by this product.$LABEL$0
Oh the Pain....But it was Worth it.. Please, don't judge this series by it's painfully dull first episodes. I read the reviews and was prepared for it. So as I sat patiently waiting for it to get better I knew there was hope in the form of seasons 2-5. So bear with the bad acting (does not apply to all actors)horrendous and often laughable music and dear lord the tedious plots. Because I promise every single one of those things improves tenfold. The music must have been complained about because it is completely different. Some actors were replaced and others became more comfortable with their roles. And the plot actually produced audible gasps from me at more than one point. Quite a challenge and I never saw it coming. So bear with it and you won't be disappointed.$LABEL$1
WOW!!!. This is my first "L" Series lens and I have to tell you that I'm very impressed. The focus is quiet and the images are sharp and crisp. The zoom is good enough to capture any shot.

For Internet Newbies. I bought this book thinking it was a pretty good book after only skimming it. However, despite its thickness, it didn't have much substantial information. It explains that viruses are bad, but not much on why/how they're bad. It's great for complete computer/internet beginners, but for me it was a waste of money...$LABEL$0
It did not work AT ALL!!!! DO NOT BUY!. I have a 2000 Ford Escort and I wanted to listen to the music on my Iphone while I drove. This adapter looked like the best one but I was wrong.

Bob Skates Toddler Skates. I purchased these skates for my 2 1/2 year old grandson. They were a wonderful gift! He took off the first time he put them on, and LOVES skating (like Calliou!) There was no problem with the screw underneath the skate, and the skates stayed on just fine (this was a problem in some of the reviews). Everyone asked where the skates were purchased...so my daughter told them I got them on Amazon and now they are out of stock! These skates are the same as the ones I purchased for my children years ago, but are impossible to find in a store.$LABEL$1

Great value. Whatever your reason is for taking a long, hard look at the cheapest of range hoods, buy this with confidence. This was a perfect, and attractive replacement for a 20 year old range hood. My local Home Depot didn't even carry 36" wide, much less offer a range of options. You will need to buy and wire in a plug, and provide some duct tape to seal to your existing duct, but this thing was a slam dunk. Having read the other reviews about how light weight the sheet metal is, I got a good chuckle out of a message on the box, warning me not to pull it out of the box by grabbing the middle of the front edge. Treat it gently at install, and you'll be rewarded with a dirt-cheap but perfectly functional stainless steel hood.$LABEL$1
That was a disturbing 2 hours. Europeans can do creepy even better than the asians.This is more distorted than your average western horror, and my girlfriend only lasted until the first bowel movement before departing the scene. Some people would consider the imagery sexual, I found the movie very darkly comedic in sections.Worth a gander, only drawback again is human stupidity which is a staple ingredient in this kind of flick.$LABEL$0
Yawn. Watch 1 or 2, don't waste your time. No backstories to speak of on new character, or what happened to some missing. Doubt it's the final.$LABEL$0
Awesome debut.. Even though "Bloodletting" is often considered to be their best album, sometimes I think this is my favorite. Some of it's almost punk, but the rest is the melodic alt-rock that they're known for. "True" is an excellent song, and great opener, and "Beware Of Darkness" and "Still In Hollywood" are sweet also. But my two favorites by far are "Make Me Cry" and "Song For Kim (she said)". Both are really moving, to me anyway. I suppose to the newcomer I'd recommend a collection, but for the older fans, "Concrete Blonde" is a must. I'll never get rid of my vinyl copy.$LABEL$1
Relationships. I liked this book for the believability of the protagonists, and how they came together for a satisfying ending. In doing so, they say a lot for how you make choices in your lives, and how integrity plays a large part in those relationships.$LABEL$1
Waste of an afternoon. I recently found this book on my bookshelf and reminisced about reading it for grad school ten years ago. The feeling I get when I look at the cover of this book prompted me to put down my feather duster and walk downstairs. I then took the time to log onto Amazon and spend the last 5 minutes of my life to add my two cents. Lamest... book.... ever. Into the trash it goes.... where it belongs. I won't even bother trying to nickle and dime a hippie out of their money by selling it.$LABEL$0
Not even TRYING. Spears is not even trying to be a singer in "My Prerogative." She does do a good job of cleaning a car by slithering over it while complaining and moaning about her life. It's all so fake but what's new when it comes to Spears everything's fake. As far as whether she sings, come on! She does everything but sing.$LABEL$0

A waste of time. Obtuse and without meaning in the real world.

Fit for the campfire. The pictures show a beautiful piece of wood. What I got was a piece of wood that was gouged, had rocks embedded in it and it looked like it was dragged behind a pickup truck.

This Nothing Is Everything. The Hole in the Universe is everything promised by those raves from Oliver Sacks and Brian Greene and Dava Sobel -- and much more! It is a deep look at an elusive, yet centrally important subject, presented with eloquence, originality and charm. It amazes me that Cole has been able to take us to the frontiers of physics, exploring questions that physicists sstill puzzle over, and yet still make it entirely accessible (and, yes, even fun) to a complete novice like myself. I have read about ideas like string theory and the strange "repulsive force" that seems to be expanding the universe, but never before were these ideas so clear and appealing to me. Her writing is so fresh and lovely, it takes your breath away. And I love the connections between the notion of "nothing" in perception -- the holes in our heads, as Cole calls them -- and the nothings of mathematics and physics. Buy this book and give it to all your friends. They will thank you.$LABEL$1

Jeepers, this movie is the pits. Every once in a while a movie comes along that, despite the fact that it has kept me at the edge of my seat throughout, is totally ruined by the ending. I'm sorry, but I hate endings where the villain wins. This movie was terrifying . . . sure. But the thrill, at least to me, is to see how the heroes will finally overcome the villain. And that doesn't happen in this movie. If it had a better ending, it might have gotten four stars. One is as far as I'd go now, and this is only because I can't give it zero.$LABEL$0

Disappointing. This "book" with large type and few pages can be read in one sitting and does not live up to its billing as a look behind the scenes of an NBA season. All this book actually amounts to is a short synopsis of an NBA season with little interaction between the players the author is supposed to be introducing us to and himself. At points it comes across as ego stroking on Palmer's part dropping names of all the people who know him and how he gets into all the parties at All-Star weekend. The premise of this book has potential, unfortunately Palmer does not deliver what it is billed as.$LABEL$0
find a better trimmer.... Ergonomically, the trimmer is OK. It's kinda heavy, but that's to be expected with a 4-cycle engine. The severe vibration limits my trimming sessions to only 5-10 min tops. The biggest problem, however, has only revealed itself after a season (maybe 10 hours) of use: the engine is smoking and stalling out after a few minutes running. After ensuring it had oil and fresh gas (4-cycle, so no gas/oil mix) and the problem still occurred, I went online to find a service center. None within 50 miles of my zip code. The company (called MTD, but still uses the Troy-Bilt name) was no help at all. I've looked into other repair facilities, but I can't identify who actually manufactures the engine, so nobody will take it apart. I'm either left to fiddle with it myself, or to get another trimmer.$LABEL$0
not a good 3D experience. I bought this dvd thinking it would be great to watch because Miley Cyrus is a great singer and performer, but when I opened it to watch the 3D version there was nothing 3D about it. It came with four red and blue 3D glasses . It made me feel nauseated (well, not really) but I could not watch anymore of the 3D version. You can even watch it without the glasses because it looks like the 2D version except with a little blur. It is horrible like watching VHS version. It was a disappointment. I might return it if i can. I wonder if other 3D glasses will work. For me, I don't like concert versions of songs.$LABEL$0
Not practical or academic enough. The finance market is flooded with paper, but much is redundant and some isn't even very useful. This book manages to be both. "Market Models" by Carol Alexander is a fabulous resource. There are a lot of books and articles on quantitative finance and if you want only that, look through the literature and choose, but this book won't give enough comprehensive coverage to make it a buy.$LABEL$0
Sexism is taught by Mothers. Christina Hoff Sommers is in denial. Boys certainly are not suffering in American society based on the studies in the books Hoff Sommers tries to tear apart.

Fun vegetables. I purchased this set of fruits and vegetables for my son and nephew to use at their grandparent's house. I think they are really neat, though my set did not have a pineapple. Both kids are a little bit on the young side to use these (1.5 and almost 2) but they both enjoy them. They like to take them apart, but haven't quite gotten around to putting them back together.They seem like they'll be pretty durable. I like toys that will be used for a long time, so that's a huge plus for me.$LABEL$1
Looks Nice, but Doesn't Last!. I bought this ring in November and in February the stone fell out. I contacted the seller and ask if this was the norm for their products or if I perhaps I received a "dud"; sometimes it happens. I would have liked a replacement right but instead I was told the below."Most of the jewelries that are in this price range are most likely to last for a few months or a year or two and they are called fashion jewelry.That's why they are not expensive.Right now we offer free shipping if you want to purchase another one.We are really sorry for this."I have a lot of different jewelry and this has never happened to me. Looks nice but doesn't last.$LABEL$0
Tedious and stultifying. There is nothing in here that you can't also do with a good, basic course in Shamanism. Learn to talk to the nature spirits and Devas yourself! Goodness. I know she's trying to do a Good Thing here, but jeez - the lists and lists of step-by-step, you-must-do-it-this-way-and-buy-my-expensive-essences stuff gets old. Seriously. Learn shamanism. Talk to the plants and nature spirits and Pan yourself.$LABEL$0
Rom Finally Has The Lobes. Don't be fooled. Although this is a stand-alone episode about Bashir (and Rom), it's a great one. I think it's rather important to the series, and should not be skipped. I liked it, and have fond memories of it. But if you're looking for action, there isn't any this time. 4.5/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'$LABEL$1

Pretty, but no substance. The Zen Mind has some beautiful footage of mostly Rinzai temples. Soto's Soji Temple is also included.

Obscure film deserves much wider recognition.. "When Time Expires" is a masterful sci-fi/fantasy which is not only well-acted but also has an interesting story line. It stars Richard Grieco, Mark Hammill & Cynthia Geary. Without giving away any of the main plot, the action takes place in a remote town where an intergalctic federation has sent agents to address a "problem" involving time relating to future events. If you enjoyed "The Man Who Fell to Earth" or "Fantastic Planet," then you will love this film.$LABEL$1
True to the book. I really liked this movie as it stays true to the book. Loved Diane Lane in Lonesome Dove but in this movie she plays just the opposite character. It was made in Alberta Canada my home province and I recognized some of the Canadian actors and stunt men that helped make the movie.$LABEL$1
Coulda been even better as a two-disc set. As a single-disc collection goes, this one can't get much better. One can argue that the failed "Congo" should've been left off (and possibly even "In Your Wardrobe") in favor of still more heavily-played tracks from the Phil Collins era, but as it stands this is an adequate career retrospective. I personally would love to see a second compilation, which would have to include: "Illegal Alien", "Home By The Sea", "Taking It All Too Hard", "No Reply At All", "Man On The Corner", "Paperlate", "Just A Job To Do", "Duchess", "Keep It Dark", "Never A Time" and "Driving The Last Spike".$LABEL$1

just reading the intro was annoying. I do not think I can buy this book because I just read the beginnings gets and he jumps around all over the placewith these stories and little cute jokes , etc. Quite annoying!All I want to do is to start learning from the ground up, it is like he wants to tell historic stories and be groovy at the same time on static electricity and took 2 pages of painful reading.I don't think so.$LABEL$0
Choose another reel. I have two Mitchell 300x & one 300xe reels and love them. Great reels with 100% solid preformance. On the other hand I bought a 310ex expecting the same. Well, I spend more time waisting line 4lbs Mono, Floro, & Fireline. The line type I used did not make a differance on this reels proformance. I would get birds nest constantly. It will simply drive you nuts and take the pleasure out of your day on the water. I found it did not matter if I closed the bail with my hand or by turning the handle. (very stiff bail by the way) This is the worst Mitchell I ever owned. I purchased it for my new Ultra Lite last summer. I will never use this reel again. I exchanged it for a Shimano Sedona 1000. I am not about to go into a new fishing season with the Mitchell 310ex. Absolutly the worst reel I ever owned.$LABEL$0
Kids Love 'Em!!. The kids love 'em and what could be better than that? I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here.

Honestly the Best!. I completely loved this story. The characters came alive and jumped off of each page, I could not put it down, like a woman obsessed! When I finished it, I started it again.

Not what I expected. The chandelier was actually shipped with some parts for the three-light and other parts for the 5 light so it was hard to tell how it might have looked had we had the correct parts. In any case, the metal part was nice but the plastic inserts below the globes looked cheap and the globes themselves were rather large. I thought it was over priced and we returned it due to not have the correct parts to begin with.$LABEL$0
Fingernails on a blackboard.......... If you like the sound of someone dragging their fingernails across a blackboard you'll love the sound of Alanis Morrisette's voice.

Ok to watch when there's nothing good on tv.... The acting wasn't believable, and you can predict the whole movie within the first few minutes. It's like a low budget Tyler Perry film.

Uninspired attempt to match bandmates' solo fame. This was one more unsuccessful attempt by Tony Banks to match the solo success that Genesis bandmates Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford were achieving. This time around, Banks added a couple of singers and tried to call it a band. One of the singers is Jayney Klimek, formerly of the Other Ones (not the Grateful Dead Other Ones, the OTHER Other Ones, the ones who did "We Are What We Are" and "Holiday"). The songs are drab middle-of-the-road efforts. Even the best songs, such as "Big Man", would be outtakes on any Genesis album.$LABEL$0
Book hits home!. Helpful, useful information. Easy read. I think it might need to be required reading for all married people and/or those getting married.Hope she's at work on her sequel....wanted this one to be longer.$LABEL$1
incredible anime. A great anime similar to Dragon ball execept the fights arent as drug out and LONG they fight instsead of talking half the time. Since their is no series or manga here yet it is kind of hard to understand but once I looked it up I understood it perfectly.$LABEL$1
Not that interested. My baby was just not interested in this book, which was strange because he loves pictures of food. I think maybe he just wasn't interested in the caterpillar since it doesn't really have a facial expression or a face. He loves many other books just not this one, and for the price I was very dissapointed.$LABEL$0
Not Compatible With PS3. When it works, this game looks wonderful. However, it simply does not work on a PS3. I don't know what the performance is like on other blu-ray devices, but if you have a PS3, do not buy this product.$LABEL$0
Brian Wilson is now a joke.. Brian Wilson once the man behind the Beach Boys has come up with a CD that is a big waste of money that I cannot understand a talent that is deep in the 60 and surf music is now dead Brian Wilson please RIP.

Excellent. I bought this CD after only hearing I'm Doun, but was pleasantly surprised to find that other tracks carry a lot of punch too. My favorites: Storm, Bach Street Prelude, (I) Can Can (you)?, Leyenda, I'm Doun and I feel love. A must buy!$LABEL$1
I Miss REAL Rock Music!. Fun music, great lyrics...you can't go wrong. I'm sick of the depressing, boring rock scene of today...give me BON JOVI anyday over these wuss bands. "Wanted Dead or Alive" "Livin On a Prayer" "Never Say Goodbye"...these songs actually mean something to people...you can identify with Bon Jovi...if you can identify with someone like Marilyn Manson...seek professional help.$LABEL$1
Fabulous and Flowing. Beleza Tropical presents 18 lush Brazilian songs. I stumbled across this CD when I was 10 years old and completely fell in love with it. The Portugeuse language is beautiful and the songs only get better as you listen to them more and more. I highly recommend this title.$LABEL$1
Would not recommend. I tried making biscuits twice and ended up throwing out both batches. It has a strange taste to it and the consistency was not good. I would recommend gluten free bisquick over this.$LABEL$0
Terk good as advertised. I purchased this so my wife could have a hdtv in the kitchen. I didn't want to run wires to the kitchen and I figured the picture may not be so great but she would be able to watch it. I was shocked at the great video and audio quality so much that I just got another one. (I just needed a receiver but I found the price was the same to just buy the whole kit again).I have side by side sets in my home office and I can use her DVR (when she is not watching) to play HD quality picture to my second TV so I can watch a movie and a game or two different games at the same time. It has an antenna that allows me to use her remote controll from the different room. The red,white,yellow av jacks are the only hook-up option.$LABEL$1
Fine Ambient Pop - also try William Orbit. This is as advertised, a "pocket symphony" - more instrumental and ambient than than the more upbeat pop of Talkie Walky which is wonderful -- though that last does get some eye-rolls from friends on "Surfing on a Rocket"... this breezes by.If you like this, you will LOVE William Orbit "Hello Waveforms", which is my favourite album of the 2000s so far...$LABEL$1

Hair on fire. I managed to get through 45% of this book before I realized I would rather set my hair on fire (if I had any) than go back and read any more.So far, at 45%, there was no story. There were characters by the dozens, each with a contrived space type name like:Yelena Bugolubovo,Nierbog,Veblen, etc etc.Some of them were described with square heads, and some were huge, from other planets all settling on this space city.I was so frustrated by ill-defined characters, and the number of them without giving me a picture for my mind to grasp, that I had had enough/Maybe there's a story line, you know; good guys vs bad guys somewhere later on, but a book, a play, a movie, should entertain.This book missed the mark for me.You can obtain it at no cost, but that's about what it's worth in my humble opinion.Sorry to be so strong about it, but honesty is better than false diplomacy.Fred Auerbach$LABEL$0
Bad Bad Bad. Ordered this for my one year old. I play all instruments by ear. I am highly sentitive to the sounds that even toy instruments produce, and this one does not even come close. I have seen and own toy xylaphones that sound WAY better than this one. Not one single bell is in tune, and if I try to play a song on it, it does not even sound like the song I am trying to play. If you want your child to actually play music instead of making noise, do not order this!!!! Gave it to the Goodwill.$LABEL$0

Don't purchase unless you like to listen to yourself talk.... A few other reviewers have mentioned the "echo" when talking on these phones, and I completely agree. There was a very loud and noticable echo of your own voice when speaking. After only one day of talking on these phones, I couldn't stand it anymore, so I returned them. Don't waste your time with these.$LABEL$0
not a gadget you can play with. I installed couple 3rd party applications I purchased from [...]. After installation, I rebooted the device and it never came back again. The device failed to launch the OS and the screen switching between black and hourglass for two days till now.I tried to contact rim to get help but they I cannot find their support number on their web site!This is a really bad experience for me. I have been playing with Microsoft Smarphones from Motorola and different Palm devices, and I never had such problem before.I would say the Blackberry OS needs a lot more work to make it stable.$LABEL$0
perfect adapter choice. With a new exercise bike and no interest in wasting batteries, I needed an adapter. The branded one came in a four times the cost of this one so I figured, "Why not?" Five minutes after receiving the package, I had the adapter plugged in and working. Great choice!$LABEL$1
ELECTRA?? COME ON YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!?. First off the fact that this movie got made before an Iron-Man, Thor,Captain American and The Avengers, and the list goes on movies is ridiculous!I thought Daredevil was good, it could have been better,but I was fairly happy with the end result. I bought the director's cut ,but have not gotten around to watching it yet.I have heard it is much better than the original. OK now back to Electra. This movie is boring, stupid, poorly acted and.....do I need to continue? They should have worked on Daredevil 2 instead of this piece of garbage! Unless your a completest Marvel movie nut,avoid this one at all cost!$LABEL$0
Too much NOISE!. We have two of these mattress, but I cannot recommend them to anyone who wants to actually sleep! For some reason they make all kinds of noise - it doesn't matter if its on hard wood flooring or carpet with heavy padding, each time your child moves it will make so much noise everyone in the room will hear it.We've used all kinds of air mattresses - even larger AeroBeds and have never experienced this before - but for some reason these make so much noise I just can't recommend them! I mentioned this to a friend who has one also and she concurred so I don't think I received a bad batch - just a bad design!$LABEL$0
Constantly in my CD player. Great songs, wonderful pop song production, beautiful harmonies. I just bought this CD, and at 52 years old, I'm embarassed to say that I didn't know just how good The Hollies were. Certainly very near the equal of the Beatles, before they got all "important". This collection has all the classic "first Hollies" songs, before G. Nash left and they went all MOR in the very late sixties/early seventies - which is exactly what I wanted. That means no "Long Cool Woman" or "He Ain't Heavy". If you favor those songs, you need another collection. My one regret is that "King Midas in Reverse" is not on this CD. Can I subtract a quarter star for that? Now I have to buy the King Midas reissue as well - which I'm sure I won't regret.$LABEL$1
Did the author actually check facts?. How much of ESPN's history can Freeman botch and still publish a book? Quite a bit, it seems. An author who writes about a sports network should at least know the difference between various leagues, especially the difference between major and minor leagues and which teams are in which.$LABEL$0
Reminds me of Carl Hiassen!. Funny, the Random House blurb says the short stories read like Richard Ford's writing, but I think the novel reads like Tourist Season by Carl Hiassen. It moves very easily from South Beach to rural Vermont to Harvard Square to backwoods Arkansas to an internet chat room, but each place is very real and so are the characters. When is the rest of the novel coming out? Has Bill Gates read this?$LABEL$1
Seems to work fine. I recently got this 256 MB module for my Kodak 6340 camera, and it seems to work fine. No formatting was necessary. Its write speed is not that great, but seems to be about the same speed as the internal memory in the camera. I was told by Sandisk support that the burst write speed for the module is 10MB and the sustained write speed is under 1 MB. The module worked well in the Sandisk 6-1 USB 2 reader and was identified without any setup in Windows XP pro. It would be better if the sustained write speed was quicker.$LABEL$1
Good but a bit harsh. The book has excellent info on baby's sleep needs and cycles. However, I think the author's recommendation that kids should be left for hours is unnecessary and too harsh on the PARENTS! Ferber's book (Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems) suggests you can go in every so often to reassure the kid. I think this also works fine, since your child will realize s/he must go to sleep either way. When traveling, a gentle pat on the back also helps.$LABEL$1
Not their best work. I'm a huge Blood Brothers fan. HOWEVER-- Crimes is a terribly commercialistic release lacking creativity and the Blood Brothers usual spark. I'll admit Burn Piano Island, Burn was also a rather commercialistic, mainstream (as mainstream as someone like the Blood Brothers can get) release, however, It did have at least 3 songs I liked a lot-- Though it also contained the WORST song to ever be produced: Denver Max. Aside from these two releases the Blood Brothers have always been an amazing trio-- with excellent works such as This Adultry is Ripe and my personal favorite release of theirs-- March On Electric Children. My advice: If you're getting into the Blood Brothers, buy their previous releases.$LABEL$0
Still Singin'. Who am I to presume to review one of the all time greats? I'm giving it just four stars solely on the basis of its being a little dated. It's been twenty years since I last saw this marvel. Three things struck me that I'd not noticed earlier. (1) How really small Debbie Reynolds's role is (2) Donald O'Connor's "Make 'Em Laugh" is actually a brilliant introduction to break dancing; and (3) Gene Kelly's amazing knee flexibility. Watch him in one of his Kelly-O'Connor duets. He has a singular attribute there seen nowhere else.$LABEL$1

Useless. In college I had a chin-up bar that you twisted to tighten into a doorframe and I thought that's what this was as well. Turns out you need a drill (which I don't have) and you have to drill into your doorframe, which I can't do since I live in an apartment. What an absolute waste of money. If you live in a home and you own a drill, buy it, for the rest of us it's completely useless.$LABEL$0

Not worth the money. I had purchased Jumpstart 1,2, and 3 for my older child as she was growing and we loved all of these so I purchased preschool for my 3 year old.

Excellent book from MSPress. The 70-294 Self-Paced Training Kit does an outstanding job in teaching the objectives of the exam.

Wasted tape, wasted money. I bought this product without first checking Amazon reviews and I regret it. If I had known that this machines was designed to waste 1-2 inches of tape each time you print a label, I would not have bought it. The real cost to the label-maker is in the cost of the tape and if you are literally wasting 1-2 inches for each use, then a roll of tape will not last very long. I called their "customer service" line in the hopes that I had not set the margins properly but was told that although they receive complaints EVERY day about this problem, it's not a design problem, it's my problem. Not very helpful and extremely frustrating since I asked if there was a way I could provide customer feedback for the next version of this model. I would not recommend this label-maker and I definitely would not recommend calling them for help either.$LABEL$0
Great! If you already know the material.... According to an instructor of mine (not the one teaching the course), this book was written by mathematicians for mathematicians. If you are not already well-versed in proofs and logic, this book is excruciatingly difficult to follow. The instructor teaching the course was a Ph.D. from MIT. Obviously he understands it, but both he and the book utterly failed to explain the concepts in terms that a normal computer engineer/scientist undergraduate could understand. If this is required reading for you Discrete Structures (or equivalent course) I highly recommend getting a second book that explains the terms in plain English (as opposed to in the language of Math, which I am not fluent in). Unfortunately I was not smart enough to do this myself early on, so I cannot provide a recommendation. Suffice it to say I learned my lesson and I hope my experience benefits you.$LABEL$0
The BEST. I've been playing since 1963. These are the best strings I've had.I am using them on a Washburn electric standard guitar and believe it or not a classical guitar that I bought in 1970 for $17.00. These strings tuned easily and hold tune for long periods of time.Love em.Ps. In the past I have used Martin strings but never the Martin 130's.$LABEL$1

Poor fit and uncomfortable. I admit to writing this without having tried any other mouthguards, but I'm not impressed with this one at all. The groove for you to rest your teeth in seems too shallow so it is very easy for it to come out of place. I also find it very uncomfortable, even after I cut off back ends (as suggested by the instructions to provide a proper fit). Unless you are 8 or 9 feet tall and have a gigantic mouth, I highly doubt it will fit without cutting off the back ends. So you're stuck cutting off the back ends to try and get a proper fit, but of course even if you're not satisfied after that, you can't really return it in that state. Also the case it comes with doesn't stay shut.$LABEL$0
It's been worth the wait!. It is about time that NSYNC got their CD out. But trust me, it is well worth the wait! This CD is packed with excellent songs. I also like the way that NSYNC is trying songs and styles of singing that other boy bands haven't yet. They are definatly talented. If you had any doubts about this then go out and buy the CD. It is definatly worth the money, and I promise you that you will be happy with this CD! Happy listening!$LABEL$1
Cannot recommend this at all. WARNING: I received this thru the USPS today. It is much smaller than stated on site. It is very light, crystal is typically heavier than glass and this is glass. Also every edge is razor blade sharp and is way too dangerous to have around small children. More of a weapon than an ornament. I contacted seller immediately and have heard nothing from them. Very disappointed. I feel like they should have paid me to take it off their hands. You will regret it if you buy it.$LABEL$0
A great True crime book. I really enjoyed reading this book it was very interesting and thought that the authors did an amazing job interviewing the key people. It did get a little slow at times but it was just because of all the details. It did have a little too much detail as to what was done to the children and the effects that occurred but it helps us understand and realize what the parents and medical staff had to see these helpless children go through. I do recommend this book to all who like to read true crime. Enjoy! :o)$LABEL$1
good while it lasts, but doesn't last long. As others have reported, quality is disappointing. Thought it was a good router at a decent price, until it started breaking down, regularly (shows red diagnostic light).Linksys website indicates that company knows about the problem, and will replace (only) if within warranty period. Technically within their rights, but seems unethical to me -- they sold a defective product and aren't taking the responsibility for it.Recommend you avoid this, and be careful about other Linksys products.$LABEL$0
Woah!!. This book sums up the trilogy perfectly. Captivating from the beginning to the end, I have to blame this book for 2 - 3 late projects, but at the same time thank it for one of the most captivating reads i have had yet. The story was well paced and delivered with immaculate style. The constant swapping between caricatures was a stroke of genius, I was never left waiting and wondering what was happening with the many other caricatures.11/10, one of the best reads i have had for a long time$LABEL$1
Great CD.. If you're looking for a great album with REAL music, this CD is for you. Sugarcult's music is very enjoyable & the lyrics are honest.

Highlights are "Stuck In America", "Saying Goodbye", "Pretty Girl (The Way)", & "How Does It Feel". Pick this up today. Great music. Great price.$LABEL$1
Disappointing read, wonderful appendices. I found this book difficult to get through. The first part (of what was to be a 5-part book) is choppy with superficial character treatments. What makes the work remarkable is the harrowing circumstances in which the author was writing. It's deeply tragic that this wonderful writer suffered and was murdered during WWII. The writing and storyline vastly improve in the 2nd book, and I believe if Nemirovsky had been able to revise and complete the novel, it would have been wonderful. As it stands, the book is rough and hard to digest. I do recommend this edition, however, because of the moving letters in the appendices written by Nemirovsky and her comtemporaries during the period leading up to and following her deportation. Those (not the fiction!) brought me to tears.$LABEL$0
Rediscover Good Bread. I've been an amateur breadmaker for years, but tend to bake irregularly because of the effort involved. No more! Mark Miller's recipes for bread both plain and exotic, healthful and richly delicious, have rekindled my enthusiasm for bread. I'm baking almost all my own bread now and making breakfast and lunch special occasions. From genuine sourdough, comforting cornbreads, spicy cheesey flatbreads and foccacia, to tempting quickbreads and breakfast treats (try Cream Cheese and Blueberry Bread, or Scottish Scones with honey, cream and Drambuie) No tedious copying of recipes from a library book this time: there are so many delicious recipes (and I've tried a lot of them) that I need to buy this book!$LABEL$1
I join the consensus. What's the point? This has been asked many times: Why was Psycho redone, scene by scene? I guess someone who did not see the original would find it intriguing and fascinating. And there are some more explicit skin scenes, a la post 1965, which do make it look more real. So it's not a total loss and maybe worth seeing, but probably not owning.$LABEL$0
I thought this book was boring.. It was about a boy and his family. The last chapter was good but you have to read the whole story to get to the last chapter. It's not worth it. I do not recomend it.$LABEL$0
Works great BUT..... This works great. The size was such that I was able to cover my blueberry bushes and miniature apple trees completely. I used lawn staples to secure the netting around the perimeter of beds where they are planted. BUT, the squirrels still try to get underneath. My wife found one caught up in the netting that was bunched up. She managed to free him and he run like the bat from you all know where....:) The birds do find the odd spot where the staples have loosened, but we finally got blueberries for the first time in 3 yrs. I highly recommend this product.$LABEL$1

Anything for a buck. Don't expect your version of Quicken to last long. Unlike almost all other software developers, the folks at Quicken seem to look for ways to make their product out of date so they have to be repurchased.

"Arms" embraces the human heart. Upon finishing Ms. Boss's recent book of poems, I found myself identifying with the lengths to which a woman will go to please the men in her life. Instead of bemoaning this situation, she seems to infuse her words with an an ironic twist which brings a smile rather than a frown to one's face. It is hope instead of despair that survives; Laughter instead of tears; reason rather than insanity. It is perspective, which is comforting in these most uncomfortable of times between men and women. There are no villains in her stories, only flawed human beings who don't always make the right decisions at the right time. They try and that's what counts. Her poetry will make you think and feel and find solace in how far we've come and yet, how much farther we need to go in the area of man/woman relationships. It is a challenge any reader will be prepared to do after reading her work.$LABEL$1

It was great...until it broke. Overall this is a great value mask, considering it is easy to adjust, has a tight seal and does not fog readily. But there's one problem...you can't use the mask when the straps break. After about 3 hours of use one of the straps broke. It still works, but the seal is not as tight, and is not quite as comfortable. It is probably only a matter of time before the other strap breaks too. So overall1. great mask2. crappy strapsif you buy this1. buy yourself some strong straps$LABEL$0

Most Helpful Book on the Subject. I have read many books on the power of creating your own reality, but I like this one the best. I do the meditations every day, and they make such a tangible difference in my life. I had lesions on my legs that wouldn't heal for months. I'd meditate every morning on healing them, and at night they would be noticably improved until they were healed. I have used the meditation to heal myself emotionally of extreme sadness and other strong emotions, I have used it to bring more financial opportunities into my life. After meditating, everything seems right, my problems seem to resolve themselves. This book is pleasing to read, as is all Dr. Dyer's material. I think of him as the father I never had.$LABEL$1
Lame, Artsy Excuse for a Book.... The title does indeed say it all: Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales. The book stinks and the tales are stupid. I honestly feel like I have wasted my time for having read it. The only reason that I gave it two stars is that some of the art has creative redeeming value with the picture of the table of contents crashed, having some pages that are blank, and blanks spots where reluctant characters have run away. The art work and the text layout are worth studying. The text reads like a series of poorly executed campfire stories with the ugly duckng simply growing up to be an ugly duck and instead of having the sky not fall... the table of contents falls and crushes all of the characters in Chicken Licken...Crazy James$LABEL$0

very interesting, insights both good and bad on polygamy. Annie Clark Tanner was an admirable person. When I completed reading this book I had a strong desire to call one of her children, if any are still alive. I appreciated the support and understanding she received from her children as they became adults. They had a wonderful mother. I am amazed at all she went through for her husband, without bitterness. However, she was open about her feelings, which let me know that she was "real". Thank you Annie, for writing about your life and sharing your experiences.$LABEL$1

low price, the razor logo can not be peeled off. Low price. Save some $5 compared to picking up same helmet from major department store. Downsides: looks a bit bulky. Maybe check fitment in local store before ordering online. Annoyance: I usually peel off silly tape logos for a cleaner look, but the razor stickers are painted over with the glossy layer and can not be removed. Had to cover silly logos with reflective tape instead. ** Consider also: Brain saver 8 helmet -- seems to be popular at the skateboard park, especially in matte grey finish.$LABEL$1

The Writing Process as a Fundamental Method of Learning. Although Zinsser's book may not have been exactly what I had expected, I found the concept of "writing across the curriculum" to be a fascinating and practical concept. I was reminded again of the importance of organizing, writing and rewriting if I want to produce good, clear writing.Advantages to the "W" concept include:* Motivation* Learning how to read to extract meaning out of the text* Learning to write using a personal writing style* Learning to use the process of asking questionsZinsser tells of his own journey as he explored the principles detailed in the writing of this book. I enjoyed his illustrations, analysis, and conclusions. Zinsser credits the many that provided information and inspiration into the writing formation of "Writing to Learn." This has been a true learning experience.$LABEL$1
Watch for fit problems. If your vehicle's mirrors are a stationary fairing or housing with a pivoting mirror inside, you need to make sure that the mirror is well recessed in the housing on both top and bottom. The clips in the arms of this mirror need to extend into the housing about 1/4 inch, and they are fairly thick.When attached to the mirror on my 2008 Pathfinder it restricts the adjustment of the Pathfinder's mirror, forcing it to point down as the mirror is nearly flush with the housing on the bottom edge. I also found vibration to be a problem, perhaps partially due to the problems with the fit.On the plus side, it appears to be well constructed with plenty of adjustment in the straps, and my fit issues may affect other brands as well.$LABEL$0
Dont work. very flimsy, won't work because of the flimsyness of the product. Just paid like a dollar but not even worth the dollar. I just threw them in the trash$LABEL$0

bad job staying connected. I bought this product 9 months ago and used it to go online with my ps2. It connected but it kept on losing the connection everytime i play games like socom 2,socom 3, killzone, and other ps2 online games. I bought the logitech network extender and used that to get online. This product was similar to the nyko product. It worked well and it was free from losing connections. If your planing on playing online with easy hook ups then I would recommend the logitech network extender intstead of this product.$LABEL$0
What the hell is this!. Why isn't "Duty Now For The Future" available statewide but this "stuff" is? What were the spudheads thinking? I can understand looking for a creative outlet but please, don't ruin great songs in this fashion. But hey, what do I know. These guys are still great and everybody makes mistakes.$LABEL$0
By far the worst film I have ever seen...... While Lynch fans (who are these people???) will lap this film up, I was alternately bored, humiliated, riled, and depressed. Nothing, and I mean nothing, makes sense and before some pretentious wiseguy tries to tell me about postmodern nihilism or anti-narrative otherness, let me say that while film can be an instructive tool, it must also be entertaining and I can't imagine who would want to curl up with this waste of time at any point in their day. I would describe plot elements, but they would be irrelevant. Proceed at your own risk.$LABEL$0
SVGA male to male 3ft.. This item was very good for connecting a VGA switch box to my computer. It was well made and performed well when switching between computer monitors and TV.$LABEL$1
Snow White Rocks!!!. This version of the Grimms Brothers Fairy Tale is excellent. The digital transfer to DVD is so good that I felt like I could have walked right into my television set. Once again Signourey Weaver nails her performance as the wicked step-mom Claudia. All starts out fine but then things quickly pick up as step-mom and step-daughter battle it out to the final blow. This version is top knotch all the way, I was very pleased with everyone's performance, the movie's photography and storyline. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good suspenseful movie while reliving a childhood story at the same time. Also the chills are more from the suspense side and little to no emphasis on blood and gore. My only recommendation is that younger kids don't need to see this version unless you want them sleeping with you for a week. I give it my thumbs up rating as well.$LABEL$1
I love this watch, but.... I really love this watch, but I hate the fact this baby retails for $4.450 and can be had for $4.075. A preowned one may cost you around $3.000. Some jewelers tell you that if you invest in this watch, you may get your money back withing 10 years. That never happened to me. If you think about it, it's like buying bonds from corporations and not receiving interest in return, just your money back! Are watch aficionados subsidizing Rolex? Is the cost of wearing a brand, tradition, and history on your wrist really worth that much? I can get an Omega Seamaster 300M GMT with automatic movement Cal. 1128 and COSC Chronometer Certification for $1.630. I would be buying into prestige, tradition, and history for 1/3 of the price. Is the Explorer II water resistant to 300M? I think not. So what's all the fuss? Yes, the Explorer II is a beater and a dressy watch at the same time with an outstanding craftsmanship. I would give it a 5-star rating if ever sold for $1.000.$LABEL$0
Cuisinat DCC-1200 Brew only lasted a year.. I bought this coffee maker a year and two months ago. It was fine until last week when it suddenly stopped working. Tried everything I could think of, but it just won't brew. After paying that much for a supposed brand name appliance, I think I will just use a French press. No electronic parts to go haywire! Very disappointed.$LABEL$0

More of the same. This book is more of the same. If you've read all the other raw books on the market and you know how to feed whole bones then don't bother buying this book. Here's the book in a nutshell: feed the biggest bones you can and try to mimic prey animals. That's all it says. What a waste of money.$LABEL$0
Remarkably bad. I bought this for my son. He could not finish the movie it is so banal. Terrible acting, bad script and badly directed. Do not waste your money.$LABEL$0
Better than the Path of Boredom. While far short of his excellent work in the first five books, Winter's Heart is certainly better than the miserable 8th book of the series. It is much like Lord of Chaos and Crown of Swords; tedious in some parts and spectacular in others. Its worth the read, but won't keep you awake waiting for book 10.$LABEL$1

this headset. This headset is cheap and easy to use at 1 major cost: comfort. Fully extended this headset doesnt quite cover my ears (i have a regular sized head, most mics i actually have to make them as small as possible) and it also feels like its trying to squeeze my ears together as a result. i dont recommend this mic unless u have a very very small head lol$LABEL$0

BEST GAME EVER MADE.. This game would never get old playing it back in the day they should really bring this franchise back to console or a new pc game. Tribes 2 required skill something you don't really need in most games today. CTF was the best mode I think you could play 32 vs 32 was awesome you could choose from light, middle and heavy I think customize what you use. This game was just unbelievable it was so good the gameplay and wide variety of maps made tribes 2. The game is very complex I won't go into it but it was the best of game I have ever played, including halo, gears, all call of duty, cs its just so different and unique compared to all others. It is a shame the company isn't around anymore. Many people have tried to make sequels but failed in my opinion. The most popular one played with a web browser it isn't the same.$LABEL$1
Very Helpful After Losing A Loved One. I found this book very helpful after losing a loved one. I particularly liked the format of this book. The authors give excellent ideas and suggestions as well as inspiring meditations. I highly recommend "The Empty Chair" to anyone who has experienced a death of someone close to them.$LABEL$1
This ebook is short.. The PDF is 56 pages long. The text starts on p. 7. There are 5 pages of ads at the end.$LABEL$0
excellent Belgian prog. As a Canterbury-style prog fanatic I had to check this band out and they did not disappoint.They have great rhythm section with jazzy keyboard and tasteful/soulful guitar playing.The vocals by Pascal Son(female) are staccato and high-pitched and act as an addtional instrument.The melodies are very catchy and melodious in the Canterbury style.In addition there are four bonus tracks by the previous incarnation called Classroom.On one of the tunes Son sings in French as fast as she can,kind of like doing vocal scales,but it works. Classroom were much less prog and more jazz.All the tracks on the Cd are from 1973 and 1974.Their second CD called "Viva Boma" is worth checking out also.It's more subdued and has a Matching Mole sound$LABEL$1
A very long read that leads to an unintelligible ending.. This is a very long, static and redundant tale that comes to an abrupt conclusion that could cause mental whiplash. I am curious that the other reader/reviewers who have made entires here find the story and its sudden, odd and unlikely ending so fascinating. I re-read the last four pages several times with the hope that the meaning would dawn on me. I get the facts of the finale, just not the context in which they fit into this story. I consider myself an avid reader (and one who grasps the plots and nuances of writing) but this one makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. (I welcome comments from any reader who can clear up the matter in a private e-mail; I have written to Mr. Cook to ask for an explanation.). Definitely not worth the effort for me; move on to the next book on your list.$LABEL$0
Fooled again. I bought this thinking it was the same as the original 'Joseph' LP I used to listen to endlessly back in the early 70's, as a preadolescent. It appeared in the States to capitalize on the success of Superstar -- down to using hte same typography on the cover. But even though the vintage (1973) of this version is about right -- this *isn't* the same recording. In fact, though my memory may be gilding the original a bit -- this one's very much inferior. Has the original US release ever been transferred to CD?$LABEL$0
Missed that it would not play in america. I did not like the fact that it is an "international" version, but sold here in America where it will not work, unless you have a newer model dvd player that plays dvd from both home and abroad$LABEL$0
Nine Ab Exercises. I didn't find this DVD very useful. The routines are boring, and the instructor is annoying. He sits in front and does one or two of each exercise while counting by drawing out each number "onnneeee, twwwoooo...," and then he gets up and watches the girls for the rest of the set. Each routine is just three sets of three exercises. The warm-up is pointless; it's just running in place. Once you learn the exercises, there is no need for the DVD, which does little more than count for you.$LABEL$0
Hateful and self-deluded. This is a hateful and ridiculous book whose only serious audience can be bigots.$LABEL$0
Very Informative. Very good read. Lots of information and nice charts to help you understand what you are looking at. Would recommend to others who are interested.$LABEL$1
Perfect. This is perfect for my new Olympus E-PL1. I bought this to protect my lens and, for that, it's perfect.Personally, I don't see any difference in my pictures but I'm very amateur and haven't done any tests.Note: I received mine with a very small crack at one point at the rim of the glass. It's like someone twisted the metal band a little and caused a small pressure crack. It doesn't show up in any of my photos so I didn't return it.personally:Perfect lens protection for the price (compared to olympus' 40.5mm for $30).I would recommend it to anyone$LABEL$1

Dr Anne Andersen. This was rather a disappointing book, given the "hype" that surrounds it.There were one or two interesting chapters, but it written for "newbies" and I'm afraid most of the information was out-of-date.Anybody could get this information, and more up-to-date "stuff", reading Phack and trawling the Web.Nothing about the virus Chernobyl, and its offspring, Colossus, used by the UK and US military, to blast unwanted intruders.On a more basic level where is the info on Back-Orifice?. In the Psychology Dept at Glasgow University, we have protection , via firewalls and Norton's anti-virus software.Meinel doesn't address the issue as to how these packages work,with "all" her writings and self indulgence, she doesn't say that these systems are virtually hacker-proof.How do they work?.Next time she writes a book on this subject, lets hope she goes up-market, instead of pandering to spotty faced youths, hiding away in bedrooms.She is capable of better things, if she wasn't on an ego trip! .$LABEL$0
What a dog!. The working title for this film (shot in Nebraska in dead of winter) was, listen to this: Born to Loose! I know, I was there. The director (Eleanor Gaver) paid a producer (Jonathan Krane) to direct the film she had written--her first and last film. Michelle Johnson, hot off the "Blame it on Rio" movie was paid a lot to be in it, but she was a whining "bitch" who didn't care to be on this production. Can't blame her, no one did. But she probably never worked again. One good performance was that of the motorcycle gang leader (Neill Barry) who continued to work in Hollywood, mostly television series episodes. --First A.C.$LABEL$0
Disappointed, useless in the field.. No photos, sparse black and white drawings (most plants don't even get a drawing). This book could be used as a cross-reference at best for a true field guide.$LABEL$0

AMAZING no other like it out there.. This books is amazing, it shares so much from the males point of view,finally their is a book out there that knows what we go through and that we do want to make our wives happy and loved. i caught my self laughing a few times because i can relate to so many stories. This book has really taught me how to talk and give the attention my wife really desires and in return i get the respect that i need. The information in this book blew my mind, by far the best book i purchased.$LABEL$1
Interesting. This book was a little harder to read and was a conglomeration of pilot's stories of one of more iconic aircraft of the RAF during the war. I was particularly looking forward to reading stories of 486 (NZ) Squadron, but there were precious few. Nontheless, this book gave me insight into a great aircraft and the dedicated pilots that flew it.Well worth the purchase price for fans of the Typhoon.For fans I would recommend the books by Jim Sheddan (who is still alive and living in North West Auckland, New Zealand).$LABEL$1
Does a good job softening new leather. But be careful if you are using it on newly dyed leather. I used it on a fresh dyed, but completely dry, piece of veg-tanned leather with contrasting stitching, and it caused the dye to bleed out and discolor the stitching a little. Next time I will use the oil to soften the leather before I do the stitch work.Overall, it's a good product. Veg-tanned leather can get stiff when you dye it and this product does a good job of softening it up.$LABEL$1
Perfection. WOW, what a nice product. Within the first hour of it's arrival, I had to see if I could screw it up somehow as I would either under cook or over cook my rice. The very first use of this cooker boasted a very nice texture of rice. I cannot wait to continue making rice in the future. For those of you that are as inept as I was at cooking rice, I would highly recommend this cooker if you enjoy rice as much as I do.FYI, the rice I am using is Mahatma Jasmine$LABEL$1
Great Business Lessons. Sacchi's book worked for me. I've been in my own business for 20years and never done a business plan,mainly because no one has make the case of why I really need one. Sacchi, not only makes a compelling case but makes it easy to develope. His real world examples and experience also lend to the simple yet important formula for building and redesigning a business in a purposeful way. My business will be more successful because of this book.$LABEL$1
Disappointed - Again. The phone was very annoying. Everytime I tried to call on the phone, it would not connect. I would have to either change the channel or just not call. I was only able to connect to the number I was calling once in the 30+ times I attempted to call. I returned the phone and went and purchase a different manufactured phone. Consumers Report was very wrong in their rating of this phone. The phone was terrible !!$LABEL$0
Poor Product. This product is awful. It broke on the second use. I went out of my way not to over tighten anything. There is a long partiality threaded rod (piece with the hook on it) that ends in a plastic spreader. As you tighten down rod the friction applied to the spreader causes it break lose internally and push the rod all the way through the spreader. Causing a failure. (very poor design). Something like a BB on the end of the rod would have worked. The BB would have kept the drill through effect of the rod from happening (The end of the rod is so ragged I cut my finger just trying to get the spreader back on)$LABEL$0

PUR Water Filters DEVELOP CRACKs and leak easily.I bought the first 3 months ago and it started to develop hairline cracks after 2 months.So, I got a second one thinking it was a fluke....this one developed cracks and leaks too.Built so cheaply that it simply cracks and leaks.Very Disappointed.PUR Water Filter = Money waster!$LABEL$0

Great but not as great as it could be. If this game was not hyped as much as it was it would be wonderful. It is kind of like combining Morrowind and The Sims, but it's not as in-depth as either one. My major beef with this game is its legnth. If it was on the PC it would definitely have an expansion pack coming out in a few months. The other beef that everyone has is that it doesn't live up to its hype, what videogame ever does?$LABEL$1
Wow. I received this album from a fellow jazz musician now playing in Shanghai, & while my expectations were not that great, boy was I in for a surprise! Francesco Cafiso, now 23, was, in my opinion, another Paul Desmond. I'm not impressed by the fact that he was an accomplished alto man at an early age. Most great jazz musicians usually are.I'm going to keep this short, & just tell you that what impressed me most was the maturity he showed in his handling of a ballad. In the business of jazz we say that "anyone can learn to play fast, but it's the ballads that separate the men from the boys." I was most taken by his work on "Polka Dots and Moonbeams." His handling of "My Old Flame" was absolutely gorgeous as well.If you are a sax lover, you'll find that there is MUCH on this album to love. I recommend it very highly.$LABEL$1

This is a great game if you know how to understand read words to you and know how to use the mouse you would be able to play.. This is a game where you are Erika and you have to complete many deeds in order to become the queen in three days. So, you have to complete all these tasks which requires you to go all over the town.You get to bake cakes, take care of a kitten, grow flowers, and much,much more.This is probably a great game for a kid ( probably a girl) who is at the age where she knows how to basicaly can understand words ( read to her) and knows how to use a mouse.This is a really fun game but, as you get older you might still like it at the age of nine you don't have to like the Princess and the Pauper to play this game.[...]$LABEL$1
mccartney is poorly represented!. Please buy this if you are likely to enjoy a completely sycophantic deluded lesson on the greatness of john lennon as a solo artist then this is the dvd for you.any mention of mccartney's work is not only severly biased but far too slightly covered.the truth is lennon missed mccartney as much as the other way around,indeed possibly much more.john lennons early 1970s work is totally overated here whilst paul mccartney's is totally underated.this is not a balanced view and a a pretty miserable beatles docu.i do believe the next in the series covering their work from 1973-1980 is actually being released this week [nov2011].it will be interesting to see the 'lennon spin' his hero worshipers put on his miserable output during this period whilst mccartney went on to become the biggest selling artist in the world all over again.!$LABEL$0

WARNING: Not creme-de-la-creme Paris chillout.. I first became addicted to chillout music when I heard Cafe del Mar 8 playing at a record store in NYC. Since then, I've become an avid collector and somewhat of an afficianado.I bought "Paris Lounge" based on its very positive reviews. But compared to Cafe del Mar, Hotel Costes, and the magnificent Buddha Bar series, this collection does not make the grade. There are some good samplings here, but all in all, it is uneven, badly mixed, and often way too weird to be even listenable, let alone enjoyable.$LABEL$0
Great book for all ages. this is a book which can be read by anyone and each read makes it more interesting. had read some stories long back and loved reading it again.$LABEL$1

It remembers so you don't have to. I bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and extremely helpful for sleep deprived mothers. With the touch of one button, I can keep track of how long it has been since I fed my baby. I don't use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone. The first unit I was sent was defective and I received terrific customer service when I contacted the company. I am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because I'd like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well. Maybe a future model.$LABEL$1
A lifelong favorite.. This is one of two books which I read until they literally fell apart. High praise indeed. James Ramsey Ullman, through Rudi Matt taught me what guts, dedication and loyalty were all about.$LABEL$1
one of the best SEs!. This is a classy collection of a particularly good time (1987) when Playboy photographers and models worked together to produce wonderful photos. Some of the favourites are here: models such as Veronica Gamba, Ruth Guerri, and Lourdes Estores, and photographers such as Arny Freytag. The copy I received was as described, and suffers only from a lack of page numbers (none of this issue have page numbers, nor a table of contents).$LABEL$1
Don't let the title fool you.... This book is superb, and covers so much more than the two style trends mentioned in the title. Many people relegate Biedermeier style to the 19th century, yet this book covers design trends from the Renaissance onward, as it evolved in Germanic lands. The breadth of interiors covered, the quality of the photos, the writing, this book has it all. I see that it went through two different permutations of the dust jacket, possibly in an effort to attract buyers. I think it is the title that throws potential buyers off. This book is essential for those wishing to know more about German interiors as they evolved over time, as well as a great sourcebook of ideas to be adapted to modern-day interiors. Buy this book, you will not be sorry.$LABEL$1
Do not buy!. I bought this griddle for the obvious benefits of requiring less storage and the ability to run two temperatures at the same time. The drawback to the griddle is that any time it is used the grease does not make it to the grease catching cup, intead it leaks right out onto the counter surface. This is a huge mess! The same probelm is encountered when trying to make an omelete, the egg runs right out through the middle crack. I was very disappointed. I'll be buying another soon.$LABEL$0
WOW, well done graphics Hoever EURO style. This was some incredible design job and the graphics are truly incredible as are the sounds and sights. Its like a virtual reality day at the Races.The only slight drawback to this game is that even when you select a race in the USA, all the races arr in Euro distances and measurements, making it tough for many of us to be sure of the distance.However that said, this game is complete in every other way and a must buy for the Horse Racing fan.I would tell the programmers of this one to go back to the start phase and make a USA Version of the game and use American Tracks, and this one will sell like hotcakes ! If it is not doing so already.Best Regards to All, MC - TheStickRules.Com$LABEL$1

Worst battreis EVER. I bought these batteries think that being made by Duracell that they would be a good quality battery. How WRONG I was. These things can not hold a charge for more then a few days, and that is when they aren't even being used. I did a complete discharge and refresh on them hoping that this would help their charge hold time... it did not.Do not buy these things if you want to have a good functioning and usable battery. I gave them 1 star because Amazon forced me too, I would have preferred 0 stars.$LABEL$0
Not What I Expected. I bought this CD after being seeing them on TV (60 minutes), and being a bluegrass / trad. country fan I bought it. However, they sound very little like they were made out to be in both online reviews and on TV (i.e. bluegrass or old school country). While great musisians, most of the songs sound very similar and "popish" - you can't hear any of their great banjo or Dobro in all but one or two of the songs on the CD. I think they could be great, but were trying too hard for the mainstream MTV / CMT crowd on this one.$LABEL$0

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I waxed nostalgic and bought this game only to find that it is nowhere near as durable as the old one. Not only is it smaller, but it is flimsy and constantly falling apart.

Unless you have money to waste, don't bother buting this game.$LABEL$0

Could not put down my kindle. I loved Alison Weir's "Henry VIII and his six wives" and "Lady in the tower" so I decided to read "Innocent Traitor: A Novel of Lady Jane Grey" next.

Very Overrated. This wasn't very good. It wasn't very interesting. There was no real merit or redeeming quality to any of the characters. It wasn't an awful movie, but it leaves you wondering why anybody would ever bother making it. Nothing really stands out as singular or intriguing.$LABEL$0
No Respect in Those Days. Very well known film shown a zillion times in the nuclear navy. This is a good example of the scientific lack of respect for the power and diversity of the types of problems that could occur during the testing and experimentation of reactor plants. It always stuck in my mind during the 70's and 80's when I operated and managed commercial nuclear plants. When someone writes a book on SL-1 I figure they have some ax to grind and are trying to relate past history to operations today. To me that is a hollow argument just check the statistics.$LABEL$0
What a Disappointment!. I recently picked up a VHS copy of this at a local thrift store for almost nothing. Having never seen it, I was looking forward to an exciting 3-hour musical. What a disappointment! Virtually the entire film lacked consistency and cohesiveness. Though some of the musical numbers were quite good, the acting on the part of Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave was unimpressive. Overall, the film was very labored and there was little to connect one scene to another. If you want a truly excellent rendition of King Arthur and the knights of the round table, get a copy of the 1997 film, First Knight starring Sean Connery, Richard Gere and Julia Ormond. The acting is first rate and the film is filled with action and does not drag along like Camelot does. Overall, I was not at all impressed by this film, especially when comparing it to the musicals of Rodgers & Hammerstein or My Fair Lady.$LABEL$0
Boyz II Men for the future? I hope not!. Overly-produced, utterly mainstream schlock that all the young impressionable hip-pop fans will just love.

The plates are worth the price of the book. The primary reason I buy the Osprey books are for the color plates. More often than not, the author, Rene Chartrande goes into obscure detail that adds little to the text. Like many of his other works, Chartrande does not reveal enough useful sources. Photographs of exhisting uniforms and equipment are helpful, but if these were in color v.s. black and white, it would enhance these books. Chartrande cranks out numerous books for Osprey, but it's looking more like he's going for quantity over quality. Chartrande should go back to the style and depth of his older works.$LABEL$0
The worst book about the adult experience I've ever read!. I began this book with much anticipation. After the first chapter, I was offended and disappointed. But I kept reading hoping it would get better. It didn't. The author interviews only 45 women and bases his theories on loosely held evidence. I don't know how I am going to finish this book, but I have to becausee it's a required text for a college course. As a woman and student, I am thoroughly offended and don't regard any of Levinson's ideas as "ground breaking". His methods are unscientific and he is a rather outdated fool.$LABEL$0
a sober view of life. Thom Jones doesn't mess around. He gives it to you straight: life is hard. And just because it is hard, it doens't mean that it isn't funny. With his fantastic writing, Thom Jones delievers us a masterpiece.$LABEL$1
Guster.... emo style. I LOVE THIS CD! i bought it one day totally out of the blue, because i had some extra cash. I totally love it! I bought Guster out of the blue also, and not only do i love guster, but i can listen to it with my parents and they don't yell at me to turn it off. If guster decided to go emo(a brand of punk thats not quite all the way punk), then they would be SR 71.... i don't quite get why people are describing SR- 71 as like Blink 182.... so they both have numbers in the name, but that doesn't mean that they sound alike. they both have destict styles.$LABEL$1
Looks Great!. I recently purchased this book as a gift for my friend's daughter.My kids and I were so intrigued by it that I may end up getting another one for us!It looks great for technique and has a good selection of projects catagorised from beginner to advanced.I may get her another that has a more extensive project selection to go with it.$LABEL$1

Enjoyed!. I can see where this book could/can be very controversial. I, on the other hand liked it. Never have I bought in to the HUMAN requirements of Christianity & Church. This won't set well with the Church goers that think the "institution of church" is what you have to follow & believe to be living in God's Love. For those that have been disillusioned or hurt by that way of living, this is a vindicating read. God's LOVE is unconditional. Church love is not!$LABEL$1
A contemporary story that teaches children values!. Finally, a story about teaching our children values, manners and self respect. I have been looking for a entertaining story to read to my toddlers that instill some of the values that my husband and I want our children to grow up with. Magical Chango was given to me by my mother, who knew that in today's society values were not being taught to children. We are so involved with our fast-paced lives that we tend to forget to stop and teach our children the very basics of civility. (P) Magical Chango is my gift to our children. Through a wonderful magical tale, my children are able to envision our teachings to them. The great part is, they just think its fun. Chango gives my children, through their imagination, the enpowerment to respect themselves and eventually as they grow older all others around them. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to instill values, insight, and manners into our precious gift, the children.$LABEL$1
Horse Heaven. This was the most boring audio book I have ever hear. The story was not interesting and the voices were either too loud or too soft half of the time. If this had been my first audio book, I never would have purchased another one.$LABEL$0
A Classic. Before the DVD, I watched this movie a long time ago. I enjoyed it more this time. To label this a horror movie may not be correct. Frankenstein is not like today's blood and guts horror movies. I think I read a review that said it is not scary and it was therefore given two stars, if I recall correctly. Being a black and white movie helps give a eerie feeling. In close-ups of the monster's face, Boris Karloff's eyes looked creepy and inhuman. And, the scene with the little girl is terrific.$LABEL$1
JUNK. I installed this on a brand new Dell computer and when I restarted the computer it would not restart Windows. I spent 30 minutes with Dell support to get my computer back up. I did a system restore and then bought McAfee and it works fine. You get what you pay for.$LABEL$0

Piece of junk. When it works, it works great. But the gears that turn the broadcaster jam easily. At least the thin tires that go flat when you roll over briars can be fixed; the poorly engineered gears can't. Don't expect more than a few hours of use from this spreader.$LABEL$0
She is NOT that kind!. She's not... this blond & amazing woman is the hottest thing in the music industry these days. If you expected another good looking blond woman who can't sing- you are SO wrong. Anastacia is different. Not only she is pretty; she has an amazing voice & amazing vocal qualities. This mix-up of good looks instead talent reminds Christina Aguilera- beautiful & vocal talented. Like Christina, Anastacia has a great R&B album, & she even wrote some of the songs. Her voice is so strong & unique & that is something you just can't ignore. The pearl of this album is definitely the beautiful & so-very-special balled, Who's Gonna Stop The Rain. Not only that the music & Anastacia's voice are both amazing, the words are very deep, special & makes you think of this world. Other great tracks are Black Roses, I'm Outta Love, Not That Kind & lots more. Conclusion, buy this album. I guaranty that it will be one of the best buys you'd make.$LABEL$1
Wonderful, soothing book. It is a wonderful book, that is going to give you comfort after losing your cat.Very good not only for kids!$LABEL$1
Excessively Mundane and Bizzare. This was a most disappointing book. It had an extreme amount of quotes from P&P and I tired of reading what P&P fans already knew. I expected a new story, not re-runs. I was also disappointed because we had so little time with Jane and Bingley. The author's plots were bizarre and unlikely. All of the quicky relationships and weddings were uninteresting and unrealistic. Caroline Bingley staying with the Darcys? Mary at Rosings? Kitty as Godmother? I was hoping to read about Elizabeth as mistress of Pemberly but our time was wrapped up in another "traumatic" (mundane is more like it) episode with the Wickams. Couldn't the author come up with her own ideas? Don't waste your time on this weak attempt. I recommend Pamela Aiden and hopes she writes a sequel when she completes her Gentleman trilogy.$LABEL$0
Sturdy, easy to assemble, great quality. Bought this as a 2nd changing table to have on the main floor of our house. It is sturdy, was easy to put together, has never needed tightening (after daily use for over 5 months), and looks great with our furniture.I was skeptical about the pad when I first received it, because it seems very thin, but have found it to provide more than enough cushion. The shelves hold a ton of baby supplies.$LABEL$1
Entertaining. A bit over top in some parts making it hard to believe, but ultimately I was very entertained with the story$LABEL$1
Wonderfully Ingenious. A must see movie. The movie is both innovative and sexy. Shabana and Nandita (the actresses) are sensational. Shabana Azmi is a feminist, a great actress and a member of the Indian parliament. The struggle depicted in the movie is not just something Indian or south asian women face, women all around the world face opression - only the details are different. While this is an excellent movie you should be aware that India is a diverse culture and you cannot represent the people in that culture with some of the generic statements that other reviewers have made here. There are several flavors of middle class India. Many Indian middle class women have excellent careers both in and outside the home and find partners (men and women) who believe in the equality of sexes. There are excellent women scientists, homemakers, engineers, doctors, teachers, members of parliament, etc. who have a great sense of self respect - self respect is not unique to western women :-)$LABEL$1
router reboots and will get the boot soon. My first WBR-2310 kept rebooting until it just stopped working. Dlink connected me to India, I sat on hold for 20 minutes until my call was dropped as it was answered by them. I went through that 3 times and came extremely close to smashing the router. I decided it would be better just to exchange it for a new one. Now I am on my second router and having similar issues (not quite as bad but still rebooting quite often). I would never buy a dlink router again. The equipment doesn't work and the support is the worst I have ever dealt with because they can't even figure out how to answer their own phones.$LABEL$0
Sentimental romantic gay fiction. I first read the Loon series when they came out and I was impressed by 1) the correct English, 2) the sympathy for gay characters, 3) portrayal of Indian gay love, and 4) the erotic fiction. There are classical references which I find laughable but I guess someone else might find them romantic. The poetry is not very good, but I appreciate Richard Amory's attempts. Throughout the books the theme is how a young white man learns to accept his gay orientation through meeting and having sex with Indians and older white males. His 2 other books are also good. The movie was pretty bad.$LABEL$1
The Way Of Harmony. Dr. Dreaver's book, "The Way Of Harmony", is appropriately named. It provides useful guidance for living a balanced life in language that is simple, direct and accessible. Drawing on the wisdom of ancient teaching traditions, this book provides practical guidance for meditation and other tools which are needed for living well while maintaining our relationship to spirit.I highly recommend this book both for the novice and experienced seekers alike. For the novice it offers new insights into old problems which have not responded well to traditional western approaches. For those who already have some experience with meditation and the search for balance, this book offers an excellent review and reminder of things already learned.$LABEL$1

Wild open and big. This thing is big and looks bad but I had to return it due to some problems right out of the box. After I charged the batteries and took it outside for a test the truck ran wide open. I changed the bands numerous times because they have 4 that you can choose from on the remote and the truck. It still ran out of control and wide open only ten feet from me. It was picking up waves from somewhere so we could not use this toy. The truck slammed into the curb at full speed and was just dangerous. Don't think that you are going to get any support from the New Bright Customer Service either.$LABEL$0
Great Quality Student Flute. Bought this for my 11 year old daughter; she is really pleased with it. It has a nice tone and she fond it to be easy to play. The quality of the flute was obvious. My daughter's music teacher had recommended the Gemeinhardt for it's quality and value; it definitely was what the music teacher said it was and at half the price of a Yamaha student flute.$LABEL$1
Precious Daughters!. I bought this book for my daughter's seventh birthday. We have used it over and over again! She absolutely loves it and feel very special when we read it out loud. The stories relate to where she is right now and has helped create warm memories. It even compliments her reading level and has encouraged her to learn about God. The heart shaped necklace is a bonus to this darling book.$LABEL$1
How did this get published?. I can't even finish this book, I feel like I wasted my money! I can not relate to any of the characters in this book. I feel like Shane is a jerk (to put it nicely), and I can't even sypathize with Mara because she is too pathetic. Lisa Jackson should have given Mara's character some backbone, (like when Shane takes over her office she should have kicked him out for invading her personal space, Instead she just lets him take over.) Anyway, I just wanted to vent because I really do feel like this book is a waste of time and money.$LABEL$0
This helps normalize the complex feelings of the young widow.. It was very cathartic to read this well written book. The author successfully puts words to the crazy roller coaster of emotions I have felt since the death of my longtime partner. It is comforting to know that I am not alone in my emotions even though I have felt isolated in them by friends and family who cannot possibly understand what I have been through. Reading this book was like having a best friend to cry with who has had a similar life experience. I would definitely recommend this book.$LABEL$1
Good Product. This is the third one I have had in during 38 years in the construction business. It is quality made and last a long time.$LABEL$1
Don't waste your time. This book is one of the worst texts I have read on the subject of Quantum Mechanics. Griffiths presents the subject in a glib manner presenting the easiest of material in the chapter and leaving the student to drown in problems without a clue of how to proceed. If you ever need to teach yourself Quantum Mechanics, Use the Feynman Lectures.$LABEL$0
A Disappointment. When I bought this cd, I was pretty excited. The movie had been great and I really enjoyed the music. This soundtrack, however, was a disappointment. Most of the songs are cheesy and boring, with ultra pop-styled lyrics. There are a few songs that are good, but only because they're the same as they were in the movie. Most of the others were redone and poorly so. I also bought the second soundtrack, and its inclusion of the more obscure but higher quality tracks from the movie, as well as just simply including the origninal tracks from the movie, make it a more enjoyable buy.$LABEL$0
This phone is horrible!. The speaker phone is very hard to understand and the battery gets very hot, very fast so your cheek feels like its on fire! The side buttons are also quite an inconvenience.

not happy with my fan. I bought this fan as everybody else did thinking this would be a nice fan that would last me for a long time I bought it last year and it didnt ever last me two seasons. I turn it on and it runs fine for a while then it gets hot and shuts down. So needless to say it is no god to me now I dont dare leave it on all night for fear it will short out or something like that. I only use it in my bed room at night and that is it so it is not used 24 7 so it has not been beat on. I bought a new one of a diffrent brand and have not had a problem with it . I know two diffrent people who bought the same kind of fan and theirs did the same thing. In my opinion it was not a good value for the money I paid for it it really dissapointed me.$LABEL$0
Nice concept, but poor performance. I have owned my Delta Sander for several months- bought due to the favorable review in one of my woodworking magazines.Problems:Mechanism to elevate table is flawed. Cog belt constantly slips- I have spent whole days just trying to get table parallel. Table is diffuclt to raise and lower. Called customer service a few times but they were of limited help= suggested I take to service center. At nearly 200 lbs this is somewhat impractical.Motor must be removed to replace cog belt- not a one person job- motor is very heavy.No way to avoid snip.Tool might be good for small jobs- like crafts- but working with even small panel doors leads to disappointing results.I have many delta tools in my shop- love them all except this one.$LABEL$0
Like Reading for Fun!. Learning cultural anthropology through this book is a joy ride. When I was reading, it actually felt like I was reading a New York Times Bestseller!

I've learned so much from it and I would read it again when I have the time!$LABEL$1

Good ideas...but that's it. I gave this one 2/5 because it does have some original ideas, otherwise I would have given it lower. The movie has a great idea going...it's just not implemented well...or should I say, in a horror fashion. I know a lot of people in reviews like to say "the ideas weren't implemented well" but that's really the only thing I could think. Bulbous, protruding phallus members belonging to homicidal maniacs? Bring it on, I said. Unfortunately, this one has the vulgarity and nudity typical to most of my favorite horror movies, but not enough gore and too many alterations to make the reader try to feel the effects of whatever drugs these kids were on. So, while the film didn't "bring it on," per se, it'll definitely be one I'll be thinking about in the near future...so I'll know what to avoid.$LABEL$0

Very dissapointed. I bought this title in hopes that the Synergy version of this movie would have fixed the missing sound effects track which was missing on the WB version. Well it wasn't there.

Great score, silly show.. This is a classic example of a bad show with a great score. The rather silly plotline and the quiet intimacy of the show guaranteed its quick demise on Broadway (although it was a success in London), but this CD documents what I would consider one of Webber's finest scores. It is intimate, subtle, almost a chamber musical in a way. Not at all what one would expect from this composer. Michael Ball is stunning in the lead role, and the remaining cast members perform beautifully. Several stand-out songs and an overall feeling of grace and old-world style should assure this score's survival, despite its less-than-stellar Broadway stage history.$LABEL$1
Pride and Prejudice. I have the video of one of the older versions of the movie and I also have the cd of the most recent movie. I love both of them so much that I had to get the book since it gives you more of an indebt of the thoughts etc. of the characters.I love the book$LABEL$1

Junk being shipped as the better item. This is the item being shipped out instead of the better, higher quality item you see when searching for this costume.

strangely idiomatic faust from Russia. If you're not put off by Faust in Russian, this isn't a bad performance.It might help explain why Faust was so popular a hundred years ago and nowstrikes us as a bit of a bore. Kozlovksy is one of the best Fausts on discbut he is not as subtle as in some of his other performances. Shumskaya is alsonot as good as on her Traviata -- she seemed to develop something of a slavicspinto after 1947 so she is edgier here and has no trill. Reizen is a goodmephistopheles but overacts. Still, it is a lively performance, well conductedby Nelboussine and even includes some of the ballet music.$LABEL$1

This film is a bunch of horse you-know-what. A 10 year old could have done a better job directing. It's *sort* of about a horse, it's *sort* about an owner, it's *sort* about the comeback of trainer, but only skims all of them while indulging us in none. You can't blame the cast - these people are good, yet completely disengaged while on screen. Malkovich is hurrying through it as if he's got something better to do (he probably did!) and Ozzy Ozborn would have been more convincing as the owner than Diane Lane. A complete disservice dealt to the greatest racehorse that ever lived. Watch Seabiscuit instead. That was excellent and everything this should have been.$LABEL$0
Do your research. I was not very happy with this product nor was my 5 month daughter. It reminded me of something you can buy at a swap meet for five dollars.

My fault, I should have done my research.$LABEL$0

A first rate overview of the first decade. This two-disc package is a great buy. It contains a smorgasbord of great goals and game highlights, with informative and interesting insights from many of the coaches and key players involved in the games. I've watched it and rewatched it several times, with undiminished pleasure. (I have only one quibble. To my mind, Bergkamp's superbly acrobatic goal--ranked as the second best of the first decade--is far more impressive than Beckham's long-range--and rather lucky--effort, which is ranked as the best of the decade.)$LABEL$1
Good size and worked well.. Only owned one day but tested out and worked well. In a room around 72F after a little over two hours it was at 30F empty using the optional power adapter. Placing 3 glass bottles of soda brought it up to 40F after a short time. It took about 3 hours to chill them and bring the temp back down to 32F. Switching to heat mode it took less then 1 hour to bring the empty cooler to well over 75F again. Fridge thermometer was buried so I don't know exactly.Overall I think that it performed as advertised and will work out fine. The P95 is a perfect size for personal use and trips to grocery stores not close to home. It's not huge but it's not small either, good mid-sized choice.$LABEL$1
Good quality but poor performance. The quality of the unit is done well, but the performance was much worse than I anticipated. The monitor operates on the 900 MHZ band, which is used by many devices. The camera was on the second story of our house, and the video monitor was in our bedroom on the first floor about 45 feet away. We also have wireless LAN and wireless phones (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz). Regardless of how much I adjusted antennas and channel settings, the picture and sound quality was very poor. The sound always had a large amount of interference even at very low volume levels. I would not recommend using this product unless the camera and monitor were very close together and other wireless interference was limited. There are higher frequency monitors, so I may try one of those next.The infrared picture worked well - you could see fairly well even though the room had almost no light.$LABEL$0

A good book for the newcomer to art.... but nothing new for the artist. That said, the book is nevertheless well written. The style is reminiscent of the creative flow experience itself. This book does a good job helping the newbie to understand what flow feels like and how to obtain that state. The exercises are very practical and tend to balance the "flow-like" text. I loved the illustrations. I keep going back to the book just to look at the art work.$LABEL$1

Very thoughtful, many ideas shared by a great author. Actually I bought this book for strictly "scholar" reasons. It was the right one to buy, brought me a few thoughts, also, revealed many of the issues related to Tony Kushner and his works. What I find amazing in this book, however, is it's charm, wit, sometimes irony. And, therefore, in addition to "scholar" reasons I got also a great book full of real great, funny, moving and grand... talking... :-))) I'd really like to recomend it not only to people doing research in gay/queer/theater and performance in general topics, but also to those, who're seeking confessions of a lively and exploring mind.$LABEL$1

just cheap screen house. pro : cheap, easy assembly, looks like waterproofcons : cheap material, some pole doesn't fit, big meshBefore this screen house, I got 14 by 12 screen house at Sams club by swissgear which was very good, well made and good price. I felt it was to big for us and returned it. The second one was by greatland at nearby target store. The quality was much poor than the swissgear's. Finally,I looked at the reviewes here and bought this one. I was happy about the cheap price. The pole looks likes steel which is easily get rust and some of them I cannot plug it in. I tried to bent them and manage to fit in. The screen mesh is lage compared to ordinary mesh of any tent. The roof material is same thing as a tarp and look like water proof which is good thing. The carring bag is big and nice. In my point of view, this is just a cheap screen house not better worthy than the money. You cannot expect quality of coleman or Eureka for sure.$LABEL$0
Meh, it's not very good.... I played this game 2 years ago and found it to be quite disappointing. I was a massive fan of the first "Army Men" game that came out and that was definitely a very cool game. "Army Men: Air Attack" has arguably worse graphics than the first game and the gameplay is often problematic.It was cool to play a game with helicopters and army men, but the game is so short that you'll be done in less than a day if you play it non-stop. Look, the bottom line is that this game is just too short, too easy and is clearly based for younger kiddies, so I guess for a 16 or 18 year old this game is just a piece of piss.So get it for your kids if you like, but there are many newer, longer and more stimulating games out there, even for young ones. I guess that if I were a kid I'd give the game 7/10, but since I'm older I give it 3 stars. Just look elsewhere if you're above the age of 10, trust me...$LABEL$0

Halloween Classics. I'm glad these 2 films have come out on video. They're something anyone would enjoy.

Not Yet Completely Tired of Waiting. I purchased this DVD on the strength of the positive reviews and I may have been drinking , also. For the hardcore Kinks' fan this may satisfy, for me not so much. It's really just a bunch of videos, none earth shattering. I have a bootleg DVD of the Kinks, Jan. 72, BBC broadcast from the Rainbow Theater in London. That is the type of stuff I'm longing for. There must be that & more that could be released. As with all these groups from the 60's, they need to get the product out as their fan base with disposable income is dying or losing interest. So it's bootlegs or youtube, check out Ray Davies singing Waterloo Sunset at the Roundhouse..... that's what I'm talking about.$LABEL$0

Impractical for residential use. The woodpecker pro is a good device if you live in a rural area where screeching bird recordings won't bother the neighbors. If you use this in the city, be prepared to receive a noise citation from your local police department. And no, you can't turn it down low so it won't bother the neighbors and still have it be effective. City dwellers might as well put that same $200 towards hiring an exterminator or pest control pro. The majority of times it's a single woodpecker causing the damage, so it's not like you're going to need follow up visits by the pro. This is definitely a case of where being a DIY'er has no real benefit.$LABEL$0
Slows down computer, 1/4th of the pages won't even load.. Another internet security let down. The first problem I encountered was it trying to block Internet Explorer; my options were "Allow once" or "Deny Once", I'd click "Allow Once" since there was no "Always allow" option, and up comes the prompt a second later >_< On top of that, half of the pages I go to won't load, downloads freeze, and it made my broadband connection twice as slow. I gave it 2 stars because it does seem to be protecting against attacks but ruining my connection and ability but I've come to expect this from internet security programs.$LABEL$0
No SACD?. That's because Rhino is now owned by the WEA group and they don't support SACD. They could have used DVD-Audio instead, considering all the trouble they went to creating surround versions. The DTS 96/24 tracks are decent IF you have a newer 96/24 DTS decoder, otherwise you'll get 48/24 output. This same problem will plague the upcoming Genesis reissues as well, you'll only get the SACD layer if you buy the import and that means the videos will be PAL format.$LABEL$1

Not much substance. I bought this book hoping to get informed guidelines on handling emergencies involving children, while waiting for the ambulance - or even what to do or not in cases that might not merit a call to 911. However, the entire book could be summed up in one sentence: "Call 911 and sit tight." The author goes into all kinds of details, but I could not extract much in the way of emergency response, other than to sit by the child, reassure him/her and wait for the ambulance.$LABEL$0
Hey, it's a freakin' toner cartridge, what can I say?. Well, the cartridge fit the laser printer, and it contains toner, and it works. I can't say how much longer the "high capacity" cartridge lasts compared to the regular ("low capacity?") one does, as I'm not that anal about measuring stuff like that. But if you have an NEC laser printer that uses this cartridge and it seems you're buying a lot of cartridges, maybe you should try this high capacity version.$LABEL$1
Handy. Like all the other Bucket Boss items, this is thoughtfully designed and well made. Material is durable and there are lots of pockets, inside and out to store tools. I keep my tools in a utility closet and then load this up based on what I need. Saves lots of running back and forth to get tools and I don't have to lug around a huge bucket of tools. The shoulder strap is handy as it frees up both hands to carry other stuff to the project.$LABEL$1

Insane Stories. This is an odd collection of stories. Most of the stories are of insane people. If it was otherwise, I guess that they would not be 'gothic'.

Almost good. This slicer quickly cut my home made corn beef into perfect deli thin slices...and then just as quickly turned a loaf of my home-baked bread into a pile of useless crumbs.

Chamberlain Driveway Alerts. I purchased a Reporter RWA300R 4 years ago worked great, finally failed so I upgraded to a Chamberlain CWA2000 with 1/2 mile range. The CWA 2000 never worked so I ordered another RWA300R (now made by Chamberlain) it's range is about 50' not the advertised 1200'. I think Chamberlain screwed up a good product line, I would advise anyone looking for a drive alarm to keep looking!$LABEL$0

Not much use for someone who studied music. Looking for a book that might possibly give me a better insight into the aesthetic value of music, I bought this with high hopes. Having previously studied music, I was also hoping for a unique perspective and a broader education in classical music, but found this book to be nothing more than a college level textbook. It is arranged nicely and has great appendix on creating a music library. But the author is often long winded, using musical terms that aren't clearly defined and over descriptive and opinionated explanations of composers and their works. This might be nice for someone who has a beginning interest in classical music, but not for someone who has a working knowledge of the field.$LABEL$0
Better than nothing. I ordered this light from another website. As a flashlight that you're pretty much guaranteed to have with you, it's better than nothing, but the LED is much dimmer than other lights I've owned.

Don't make this your only reference. I had this book and the Transcender exam for Exchange 5.5. It's a good thing I had the Transcender stuff. I've been working with Exchange for over a year in single-site configurations, but needed something to get wise to multi-site configurations, etc. This book wasn't enough. Maybe it was just the fact that I kept falling asleep over it, but there seemed to be major sections that the Transcender exam covered well that this didn't touch at all. All in all, a disappointment.$LABEL$0
Courting Trouble is a Stepping Stone. Let me be polite here. This book is for somebody graduating from romance novels but will never read Lawrence Block, Michael Connelly or Patricia Cornwell. Courting Trouble's plot isn't geared for any logical thinking human being. Do yourself a favor and try another of Scotoline's books. This one really insults the intelligence of a fifth grader.$LABEL$0

Months later, still going strong!!!. When my corgi Sophie first got this toy, she went wild with it... months later it's still her favorite. She's tried to destuff a lot of her toys, but this one has baffled her, HAHAHAHA!!! Extremely well made. I love the way the squeakers go into separate plush and velcro-closed pouches. Sophie loves the three different textures -- plush, sheepy, and whatever the tail is. And of course the squeakers. Sophie loves faux sheepskin, squeakers, and she loves to shake and worry her toys. If your dog likes any one of these things, it'll like the toy a lot. If it likes two, this toy will be a huge hit. If, like Sophie, it's nuts for all three -- you'll have one very, very, very happy doggy.$LABEL$1
Great Xbox Live replacement!. I was looking for something to replace the default Xbox Live headset. I did some research, and found these. They are the same thing but better. It is a more solid build. It has a leather ear cushion, and the boom mic is much clearer (So my friends say). I'm very happy with this. It's less expensive than the default Xbox mic, and its better quality. I love it. I've already shown 3 friends, and they have ordered it already. Its perfect for Xbox Live.$LABEL$1
Not worth your money. We got this for our son when he was 6 and it never worked very well. The tee always came apart and the bases are totally cheap! I wouldn't recommend spending your money on something so flimsy. The price wasn't expensive, so I guess you get what you pay for...$LABEL$0

Black light acoustic jams. Remember the sections of Black Sabbath's "Vol. 4" where the band would take a break from rocking and wander off on acoustic guitar tangents? Imagine a whole album of that, and you pretty much have Citay's debut. The album even has bongos, for chrissakes. But it's extremely well-done. Ezra Feinberg (formerly of Piano Magic) and Tim Green (of The F***ing Champs, and formerly of The Nation of Ulysses) combine on acoustic guitars, mandolin, and analog synths for some lava lamp-lit psychedelic folk. The only trace of Green's rocking resume is the occasional twin guitar harmony. Otherwise, this disc is full of pleasant vocals and gentle jams that your hippie uncle can get with.$LABEL$1

Wasted my time with this. I received this item a month ago as a wedding present and was grateful that a gift receipt was included. For all of the noise this machine made it had almost no suction and I had to soak up the stains and water with a super absorbant sponge. The brushes also failed to remove anything below the surface, so the stains are less obvious but not gone. I've had better results scrubbing by hand and after two weeks I exchanged this product for a Bissell that actually works. The Spot Scrubber simply did not live up to its name and I would never reccomend it to anyone.$LABEL$0

Very thorough, but easy to read. Grudem does a great job of taking the doctrines of the Bible, even the difficult ones, and explaining them in a way that is understandable to the layperson. He provides Biblical support for the doctrines and addresses many of the ways that various doctrines are misunderstood or misinterpreted and shows where they strayed from what the Bible actually teaches.$LABEL$1

I picked this song for the Oscar :->. This is a great soundtrack (better than the movie to me), and I was hoping that It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp would get the Oscar it was nominated for and it did. I'm glad for Three 6 Mafia that it did - it's a fantastic, tight song. The rest of the cd is good too, but there is no other standout song like that. I do like Whoop That Trick. Even though this music is a little heavier than I usually listen to, I still find it great and powerful and a fantastic cd to blast in the car.$LABEL$1

Truth or Fiction. I'm about half way through the book and I had to read some of the reviews to see if other former Marines were thinking what I was thinking, which was "this doesn't resemble the Marine Corps I served in!"I was and enlisted Marine from 76-82 and while some of Swoffords descriptions of the antics of his fellow Marines bring back memories by and large I do not recognize the Marines he described. The people I served with were more disciplined and just plain better people. I hope that people who read this book and do not know better do not accept the things that Swofford describes as standard for US Marines. They are not.$LABEL$0
Fabulous performance rendered mediocre by poor recording. This is a wonderful performance of Un Ballo, but, I tend not to watch it because the recording techniques were so poor. By that I mean that the lighting was always just a bit too low (making it difficult, at times, to appreciate the wonderful colonial costuming used for this American setting of the opera) and the sound recording levels are far lower than on another DVD of this opera I own (making it difficult, at times, to hear subtle passages). From an audio perspective, this DVD gives you no sense of presence. Everything's just a bit too murky.Though I prefer the look of the production of this Un Ballo to the Swedish setting and costuming in another Un Ballo DVD I own, I tend to watch the Swedish one just because it's so much easier to see and hear.Shame on the technicians. This might have been the best Un Ballo otherwise.$LABEL$1

Disappointment to Real MMC Fans. Four epsidoes from JUST season 6? I agree with most of these reviews in that Disney is just trying to jump on the Britney, Justin and Christina bandwagon. This is such a disappointment to those who watched, worked on, and truly loved the show. The real highlights of MMC were the other talented cast members, who were not featured. Dedicated fans know that Britney, Justin and Christina were never the most popular 'teers--why create a DVD just around them?On the plus side, this DVD features two of the better Season 6 skits--Generation Gap Shoppping and Everybody's a Winner (none of which include Brit, Justin or Christina). And, it has some good shots of 'teer siblings and friends like Trace, Jamie Lynn, Laura Lynn and Rachael (if this is interesting to anyone).This DVD will flop, and it deserves to. Disney needs to get their act together and create something that would embrace what the show really was--or not do anything at all.$LABEL$0

Total Crap and that is Generous. I am sure this movie will appeal to spoiled brats who resent their parents and the establishment in this twisted immorality play. The film was playing when I was in college, and although I thought the poster looked neat, I never saw it. I realize now that it was garbage just like all those "Billy Jack" movies and the "One Tin Soldier" theme song. I saw the movie on Showtime recently and could not finish watching it. It was the kind of crap that only a liberal intellectual could love. I do own 2001 on Blue-Ray and appreciate that movie.$LABEL$0

Blah... This may seem really stupid, but this CD definitely isn't within my decent genre range. Once in a while, there is a "pop-punk" song that makes everyone dance. I'm just writing this review because I'm searching for one of the songs from the trailer. I haven't even watched this movie, which could actually help me out, but I figured I could share my lack of musical knowledge with you nice folks. I'm wondering which song is played at the end of the preview where someone runs into a football pole, the goofy kid says "i thought it tasted funny", and what's his name is on stage playing the guitar. Some of the words are either "I'm contagious, you're contagious" or "I'm ok and you're ok". I'm guessing it's the second, though the first would be quite funny.$LABEL$0

Here's what you need to know about Mary Mapes, so-called "Journalist". Reporter Brian Ross: "Do you still think that story was true?"Ex-CBS producer Mary Mapes: "The story? Absolutely."Ross: "This seems remarkable to me that you would sit here now and say you still find that story to be up to your standards."Mapes: "I'm perfectly willing to believe those documents are forgeries if there's proof that I haven't seen."Ross: "But isn't it the other way around? Don't you have to prove they're authentic?"Mapes: "Well, I think that's what critics of the story would say. I know more now than I did then and I think, I think they have not been proved to be false, yet."Ross: "Have they proved to be authentic though? Isn't that really what journalists do?"Mapes: "No, I don't think that's the standard."$LABEL$0

You get what you pay for. This seems like a great deal. For $10 bucks more than the apple dock (standalone) you get a dock with ac adapter, a 3.5 mm to 3 RCA cable, an S video cable, a travel charger for the ipod (separate from the dock power supply), a remote, and a dock connector to 3 RCA cable (not dock connector to 2 RCA audio as advertised). Buying these components separately from quality manufacturers would cost over $100. The problem is that Cables to Go is not a quality manufacturer. The dock produced an audible hiss and reversed the audio signal, so that that the left speaker played what the right speaker was supposed to play and vice versa. Further, the remote was extremely shoddy, requiring multiple button presses and extremely accurate aiming even at a distance of 12 feet. I did not use any of the cables, but if they are anything like the dock I'd avoid them.$LABEL$0
Low fat doesn't mean precarious...... I remember that these bad boys saved my life at a job I use to have. I would throw a couple of these Pop Tarts in the toaster and enjoy with a cup of coffee. I must say that they held me over very well until lunch time.Or under the assumption I didn't have time for lunch because my former job was known for not letting an easy going guy like myself have the ability to go to lunch, despite my high production and charismatic personality. I guess that is why I don't work there anymore.I digress, these Pop Tarts are really good and they don't taste low fat at all. The bold flavor of brown sugar and cinnamon burst from these Pop Tarts like a banshee's guffaws after Halloween is over. This treat is an exquisite pastry the can be served like beignets in The French Quarter.I will stop with the metaphors this really is a great product.$LABEL$1

Moving Story. Lucy's story is a compelling one. Being faced with cancer at a young age is difficult. Being subjected to the treatments is difficult. Adding to that having your face changed in that manner and being able to work through it was a remarkable feat and took strength.It is a book that helps put many things in our life in perspective in both what we think are events and circumstances that are "too much" to handle when on reflection they are well within being nothing more than a minor annoyance and how we relate to and judge others. It also shows how strong people can be.The descriptions of what she went through and had to endure are detailed and disturbing and at times extremely unsettling. It still winds up as ultimately being a postive book, albeit sad.$LABEL$1

Otis Sounds Like A Guest On His Own CD. I have almost all Otis Spann's CDs and this is my least favorite so far. When I buy an Otis Spann CD, I buy it because I want to hear amazing piano playing. Unfortunately, on this CD the piano is burried deep in the mix and covered by loud guitars, drums, etc. It's almost like Otis is a guest or backup on his own CD! In fact on many songs, other people are doing the vocals! I would say skip this CD. If you want Otis at his best, I would recommend Walkin' The Blues (the sound quality is excellent and has a few piano solo numbers), Bottom Of The Blues, and Best Of Vangaurd Years.$LABEL$0
history, magic, journalism you cant get elsewhere. i would reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys travel narrative and is interested in magic and fortune tellers in asia. Although i can't agree with the author on all his opinions, as he seems to be against the modernization of Asia, i do agree that with the modernization there is a great loss of knowledge of nature. The author seems to have a love/hate thing going with china, doesn't seem to keen on thailand, and seems sad at the loss of how burma used to be. The book is well written and gives some great anecdotal history of asia, as well as illustrates, in part, the difference in the asian mindset when it comes to fortune tellers and magic.$LABEL$1

Worst Camera Ever. In the beginning I was very excited to have a camera with 10 optical zoom. This was the reason I switched from the very reliable Cannon digital camera to the Panasonic. I have had this camera for 4 months. It takes fine pictures but other then the increased optical zoom I don't like it better then the 3 Cannons I have owned before. I bought this camera for a trip to Egypt. The camera worked the day before my trip and the first day of my tour it stopped working. It would turn on and off, on and off and then say turn off and then back on. All it would do is repeat this over and over. Needless to say I was not able to purchase another camera or have it fixed on my tour. I had to rely on disposible cameras and other people's photos. I will NEVER purchase another Panasonic camera again.$LABEL$0
Unlikable Characters. The End of the Affair was chosen for my book group and although I seriously tried very hard to like it, I just couldn't.The main problem is the characters, there isn't one that I can say that I liked at all and I felt their actions were too unbelievable. The story itself could not hold my attention, but I was able to finish the book.I have heard that the movie is better than the book so I will give it a try if I have the opportunity to rent it but I would not recommend this book to anyone.$LABEL$0
Ending was an Ensemblescent Letdown. Most of this movie was a joy, as others have noted, because of the sets and costumes, and self-aware dialogue, and I had such high hopes for the ending.

Really, I thought maybe this one would end differently!$LABEL$0

Shocked!!!. This isn't Megadeth!!! This album is the worse supposed-to-be-metal album!!! Dave, stop going Metallica's way!! Be yourself! This album doesn't deserve the 1 star. It deserves a big 0.$LABEL$0

Avoid Delonghi Dehumidifier. I've owned this product for about 2 years. It has stopped working. The pump stopped working after about 6 months. It rattled a few weeks after purchase. It did a great job dehumidifying our basement for as long as it lasted. I wouldn't recommend.$LABEL$0
BORING! BORING! BORING!. This is without a doubt one of the worst books I have ever read. Every character is so one dimensional and the plot is so predictable. The heroine acts like a simple minded five year old and the hero acts like a stereotypical alpha male millionaire railroad bum. I don't understand how this book got such high reviews. To each his own, I guess. I'm very sorry I wasted my time with this one.$LABEL$0
Just Google Sylvia Browne CNN and You Will Find That She is a Fake. Do not believe what the book tells you about only the "White" entities being saved. Or anything in this book for that matter. Just do a Google on Sylvia Browne CNN and you will find that she is in fact a fake, a sham and a con artist. She takes advantage of those who are vulnerable. Beware of this book or any of her books for that matter.$LABEL$0
Replay in my mind. The soundtrack to Broken Bridges enabled me to replay the movie in my mind! Awesome performances by all!$LABEL$1
The Ice Man: Confessions of a Contract Killer. This man was so very twisted. I've read a lot of true crime books, but this one topped them all. He was very cold when it came to killing, which he did much of, but he also had limits as to who he would do. The book had me reading up into the night. Very good choice for those who like true crime reads.$LABEL$1
Flawed. Just an example of how the author doesn't know what (s)he's talking about:"Probably the best-known technologies used by processors are Intel's Hyper-Threading and AMD's HyperTransport. Both allow each logical processor within the processor package to handle an individual thread in parallel with other threads being handled by other processors within the package."This is an elementary error, that even amateur hardware enthusiasts know is wrong. Hyper-Threading and HyperTransport are two very different things. The former is what the author describes, the latter is a bus. It suggests that the author doesn't know much about hardware, and probably created the book by googling and using sources that may, or may not be correct.$LABEL$0
Burn Notice. Really love, love, love this show! Never a boring minute. Great acting, direction, has stayed true to it's original premise.$LABEL$1

Not as Good as the 2nd Edition. If you liked the 2nd Editon of the Standard Catalog of Cadillac, you'll undoubtedly be disappointed in this edition. This edition trades LaSalle information and price guide for a few more color photos of Cadillacs. While the LaSalle price guide is gone completely, the Cadillac price guide is unbelievably incomplete, leaving out pricing for 1921 through 1925, 1927-28, 1931 through 1935,38, 1940,46, 47,1950,51,52,1954 through 1958,1960through 1962 - and more. This edition leaves a lot to be desired for the true Cadillac/LaSalle aficionado.$LABEL$0
Over Priced. Why do I need another cork screw. Doesn't everyone in the world have at least one? What I need is something to preserve the unused portion of wine that I want to save for another day. The Vacu Vin Wine Saver Gift Pack is just the thing for that. It's easy to use and very very effective. I give it 5 stars. Spend your money wisely.$LABEL$0
Fun Entertainment. This film is a fun bit of entertainment. The acting and writing of course are not Oscar worthy but they do the job to tell a fun story. Cannot wait to see the trilogy finished.$LABEL$1
Flimsy and not intuitive to refill.. We have one of these at our shop, and nobody ever refills it. Why? It requires a fairly complex set of steps compared to everytihng else on the market. You must first unlatch the locking mechanism, fold the arm out of the way (not intuitive at all). Tried to find instructions for this online, so I could print them out to clear it up, but I can't find anything. Terrible holder, I'd rather have a homemade piece of wood.$LABEL$0
Blair at Richview Middle School. Possibly the worst thing I've ever set my eyes on. This is a story about a boy on an expedition to give his father a parcel of some sort. The main characters in this book are Adam the main character in this story,Amy Adams girlfriend,Adams Father,and Adams mother.Adams expedition begins when he delivers a gift.His Father is ill in the hospital . Oh yeah the plot of the story he rides a bycycle.He finnaly reaches his destination and finds that his faters is dead.Wow what a great book . I dont see why people praise over this book.$LABEL$0
Great stuff, but get it locally.. I know how Mallowmars taste. They are the truly splendid fall treat I have looked forward to around thanksgiving for as long as I can remember. So what I really was checking via this order was how well they ship.The answer is, terrible. The over long, Two weeks of delivery time turned the cookie part to crumbs on almost every one. The chocolate was melted to the plastic tray on half of them (only half?). Overall a fail, and certainly not something you would want to open up in front of guests.Get them locally or find a replacement. Splurge on faster shipping perhaps? I can not vouch for that option having not tried it though. As is, the standard shipping makes for sad mallomars pandas.The second star is for the two in the box that had part of a cookie left and were somewhat edible.$LABEL$0

Did not keep my valuables safe!. I organized all of my jewelry, placed it in this safe which we had bolted down in the floor of a closet. Our home was burglarized with an active alarm turned on. The robbers forced the door off the safe and stole everything inside in a matter of minutes. I wish I had never bought this and trusted it.$LABEL$0

Two different albums, two different inspirations. To me it seems So Much For the City was all about being in love, not only with the brilliance of the California Coast but with a woman as well. The music, harmonies and general vibe of the album reflect this. The follow up album seems to dig more into the underbelly of the band and quite possibly the heartbreak of losing the woman. This is just a thought, I really have no knowledge of the singers relationships but I see clues throughout Lets Bottle Bohemia which suggest heartbreak, while the first album seems to emobdy the fire on new love. I also think the second has more of an East Coast, North East in particular vibe. It's not as sunny as the first but still very unique and packs a fist full of soul. I hope to catch them live someday.$LABEL$1
An incredible tome that must be read. In this, the latest Tom Clancy thriller, Jack Ryan takes on the greatest task ever asked of him by becoming President. Though the book seems to lose focus a few times, the last 200 pages were reminiscent of Patriot Games. They just seem to fly by! The ending is not a real shocker either, but for an almost 900 page book, it does not have to be. Every aspect of Mr. Ryan's character is explored, so this is a must-read for true Tom Clancy fans$LABEL$1
return to form. After a few uneven albums, the Manics have finally returned to the standard of "The Holy Bible" and "Everything Must Go". This is by far their most consistent record since those two-virtually all of their musical eras are represented here, from the political punk of "Imperial Bodybags" to the power-ballad "Autumnsong". This is the first time in a while that the band seems sure of themselves, and it's great to hear. This is well worth buying for anyone who's followed them over the years.$LABEL$1

These guys are great!. This product does everything it says. Even for someone like me who is sometimes technically challenged, it's easy to create ringtones. You find the song you want, select the part of the song you want to be a ringtone and then send it to your phone. So simple, a manager could do it.Also, when I had a customer service issue (my fault, not theirs), they were right on top of it. They should give lessons on customer service. I would recommend this software and this company to anyone.$LABEL$1
Burn in hell. No matter how talented he was the fact is that he murdered his wife and seven year old son. This man is human scum and hopefully is burning in hell. R.I.P. to his wife and son I hope your in a better place. One star because this dvd is gonna go up in price once the gory details are more widley know. Also thanks to the WWE for pulling him off their website I bet they wish they would have waited on that tribute to what a great family guy he was. As for the dvd review sorry fanboys it doesn't matter cause in the real world he was/is a scumbag and a baby killer.$LABEL$0

Another person longing for the original!. I was overwhelmed by the no. of people who have longed for the original movie, just like me and feel that any other production pales in comparison. My parents played the music as I grew up and I never did get to see the movie (I am 48). I have had the Samuel Goldwyn Meyer Co. write to me yrs ago that the movie is tied up in his estate, and a movie channel wrote me that the film's condition has caused the delay. Hard to know what to believe, but if anyone hears of a release/copies available I would be grateful to know. Vicki at:[e-mail]com$LABEL$0
Crummy design, poorly made. Disappointed.. Antennae piece snapped off in my hand first time I tried to extend it so I really have to question the workmanship. Cord runs through bottom of stand and makes the whole thing tip over VERY easily (which it did repeatedly even though we kept pushing the cord into the channel). Cord to plug it in is way too short in my opinion. Our tv is mounted above our fireplace and everything else we have reaches the outlet, this didn't. Reception was so-so. Channels we got were very clear but there are other channels received by other tv's in the house that this didn't pick up. I was pretty disappointed given the reviews, I definitely expected better.$LABEL$0
Not well written. The diagrams were not very clear and the steps were too convoluted and not well explained.$LABEL$0

Amazing...Highly recommended read.. Well worth the time it takes to read 900+ pages. I didn't want it to end. So beautifully thought out, gracefully articulated, the story is unbelievable real and life-changing. Rich, lucid, lovely, heart-breaking and heart-opening. A view of life not many live. Do read it.$LABEL$1

Sailing through the eyes of a dingbat. This book was a total let down. I was hoping to gain some insight and information about what it is like to sail. I married into a sailing family and was hoping to be inspired by this book. Instead, the woman was a miserable sailor who couldn't even grasp the difference between port and starboard. She did not inspire woman to tackle such an adventure. Instead admits that she couldn't pull her weight and relied on her huband to do most tasks, even cooking breakfast on the boat.The book talks more about what leads up to them sailng like selling their house and quitting their jobs. And as the owner of two cats, I did not appreciate that the author "dumped" her cats because it was not convenient to cruise with them. Even though plenty of other people do this.So if you are loooking to get tips and advice on what it is like to cruise, don't buy this book.$LABEL$0

Nice scale and a great value. NO more jockeying the scale based on the floor or your position. A solid scale and we love the measuring rod to watch our kids grow (better than marking the wall), although the rod sticks some and could operate more smoothly.$LABEL$1
decent diuretic. This did not work for me. After trying it for several weeks, all it did was have me running to pee... frequently... and breaking out in cold sweats. I may have lost a pound or two, which I gained back after retiring the product. It was most likely water weight. On the up side, it may have some beneficial ingredients, and it did not make me sick (as some diet pills have.)$LABEL$0
memory foam. I had chronic insomnia and been taking medicine and had football injuries so I tried this out and I sleep better with no pain from back neck, couldn't believe it.

So far it's awful. How can I keep reading into the centuries Ruiz, by default, knows more about when the opening pages contain so many howlers? Ruiz is a U.S.-born author who has swallowed the Black Legend of those atrocious Spaniards whole. "Alienation also included the Spanish assault on family kinship ties..." (p. 16) Then why does Mexico have the lowest divorce rate in the world? Whence its wealth of thirty million unassimilated Indians? (CIA Country Facts website.) How can he write of the two proud civilizations Mexicans embody when, in the same sentence, one was destroyed by the other?I'm a bleeding-heart CA liberal from Concord, MA, and I like facts. Regrettably, to teach in the UC system, one must stoke the soothing flames of ethnic rage even if it means making things up.$LABEL$0
fascinating nightmares. I read this book many years ago when it was first published in paperback. I lost access to that copy and I am pleased that Nightmares has been reprinted. This is one of the most fascinating books that I have ever read. It is both thought-provoking and highly entertaining. The characterizations and settings are vivid. There are several long dreams, including one about competing cults that promise that either molybdenum or the magnetic pole will cure all ailments, and another about a resurgent Inca civilization dominating the earth. The nightmares are attributed to eminent persons of the 1950s' i.e., Dean Acheson's Nightmare, etc. You won't be able to put this one down.$LABEL$1

Ronnie Rocks. a very good friend of mine turned me on to this album for which i am eternally grateful for, because this is without a doubt the best album of ronnie wood's spectacular solo career. with such standout tracks like "I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN" and "BREATHE ON ME" ronnie wood shows us how talented he actually is. but then with the the tracks "BIG BAYOU" and "SWEET BABY MINE" he turns a great album into a piece of rock n' roll heaven. you may have heard ronnie wood but "NOW LOOK".$LABEL$1

Going strong after more than a year. I was frustrated with buying scales as I could NEVER get them to read accurately. I have had this scale for more than a year now and even after husband and daughter leave heavy piles of clothes for wash day on top I have NEVER had it read inaccurately or had the batteries die. I have not had any of the problems that have been previously mentioned. I weigh on the Dr.'s balance scale and come right home and it is right one the money. I love this scale and use it every day or every other day. I would buy another one in a heartbeat and have recommended it to friends.$LABEL$1
Easy operation: Crummy sound. This unit carries the best price and longest recording capability on he market. Features and operation are excellent, BUT, the sound quality is not acceptable. Tried HQ and SQ - no joy.I do stand-up and need to record both bits and performances.There was nothing funny about this unit and it went back to [the store]. Depending on your needs, this still might be the best deal out there, but it wasn't for me.$LABEL$0
Kind of dissapointed over all the hype. I was excited about getting this product after reading all the reviews and even my hair dresser said she loved it and would buy nothing else for herself.After the first few uses it was great but the longer I used it the dirtier my hair looked and felt.My hair did not feel clean and I know its not supposed to suds up so not sure if my mind was playing tricks on me or what but I did not care for it at all. I ended up giving it to my mother to try and see if maybe it was just me and havent heard if she likes or dislikes it.I think it would have been better for me if I would have alternated every other wash with this and maybe some actual shampoo. Alot people love it and thats great but I will not be buying anymore$LABEL$0
Cheapest product ever. Holmes CEO to staff; "Hey gang, lets see just how cheap and horrible we can make a fan...." And the winner is ....Holmes! and the loser is us, the consumers....This fan feels cheap just holding it. One of the rotors wobbles, hitting the grate. My 3 year old has plastic toys that are made 10x better than this. I would be embarrassed and ashamed to have a product like this at my company.$LABEL$0
In the name of Justice. Aukai Collins has written a brilliant novel which will teach the common lay reader or any reader ignorant of little (physical) Jihad, or Islam in general, just what this kind of fighting entails, and why it is waged. Collins exposes the disunity that can ruin any military expedition. He very clearly explains the motivation behind his decision to fight the Russians and others. His reasons for turning to the U.S. embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan, after having fought in Chechnya, are intriguing. As a fellow Muslim, I believe that Aukai is a true Mujahid; and you would do well to listen to him.$LABEL$1
Kids love it and I love it because it doesn't make a mess. I use this in speech therapy session with little ones. I like it because I don't have to stick my hands inside to get the wand. The kids love it but you have to "teach" them not try reach for the wand, as that is their first instinct, and also not to push the bear's belly too hard or the bubble juice spills out. Also, if the bubble juice is not topped off you have to turn the bear upside down, with his hat on of course, to get liquid onto the wand. I still love this product and give it as birthday gifts to my clients.$LABEL$1

IF REPETION IS THE LAW OF ABIDING IMPRESSIONS, THEN..... I love Louis L'amour westerns and I had great hopes that this non-western "WALKING DRUM" would equal the excellence of his westerns--and it did for several chapters. After awhile, however, the book became so repetitive that you could anticipate what would happen next. I gave the book 2 stars only because it did keep my interest for a few chapters.$LABEL$0
Not a Game for the Small Investor. This book talks about the various factors affecting multi-million-dollar developments. The misleading pictures of Monopoly houses on the cover suggest small-scale residential investing, but the properties under discussion are the size of an entire Boardwalk. Frankly, the whole "game" analogy may sound like fun, but is nothing more than representing economic forces, e.g. the cost to borrow money, as "cards" one draws. Ho hum. If you don't have millionaire investors as friends or a job doing due dilligence for huge developments like shopping centers, warehouses, etc., this scale of this book is much too grand. We're talking buying entire city blocks in Manhatten! Disclaimer: Unlike other reviewers here, I'm not a former student of the Harvard Business School professor. This text may be quite relevant to their careers.$LABEL$0
Great so far. I bought this item just over a month ago, but so far it seems to be working just fine. My 15 month old son is a picky eater and he'll consume more types of food if I blend them into a smoothie. In other words, we use it about 3 times a day and typically I add frozen fruit to the mixture. It processes the fruit into a smooth drink quickly and easily. I'm sure we'll continue using it every day so that I'll eventually have a review of the long-term performance.$LABEL$1
Beware! Journalistic hack at work. This book is nothing more than a cut -and-paste job based on the familiar accounts of duels with a few sneering comments thrown in to demonstrate the author's cleverness.The discerning reader with quickly recognize that the author is ignorant of the most basic techincal knowledge concerning the weapons she discusses. Clearly the author has not bothered to seriously research her subject--the certain mark of a journalist hack job.$LABEL$0
Sheer pleasure?. It was sheer pleasure to close the cover of this book. Trouble is we only got through a few pages before doing so. It is not anything new nor is it refreshing in any sense of the word. This is just different words for the same things people have been writing for years. Writers are becoming a dime a dozen in the field of the occult. Unfortunately this writing is for those who may need psychiatry to deal with realism as opposed to imagination and fiction.$LABEL$0
good story-filled with spelling and grammar errors. I liked the story , but it was filled with so many grammar and spelling errors that it was hard to keep track of the story. Words were missing especially the small words that complete a sentence. It was like having to read between the lines to understand the story. I used to do this when I was younger when I wrote letters to my grandmother. She always told me that my mind was working faster than my writing. She had to fill in the blanks to know what I was writing. A letter is short compared to a book. This should have been proofed more closely.$LABEL$0

Huh?. This sounds like it came right out of a Rush for easy piano book. All I can really say is what the hell? The left hand is playing chords and the right is playing the melody...could it be any more boring?When I first saw the title, I thought hmmm...I'd love to see what someone like Keith Jarret would do with Rush but this has all the imaginative quality of a karaoke accompaniment tape. For a really good piano tribute album, check out David Lahm "Jazz Takes on Joni Mitchell"$LABEL$0
Finally, a book which addresses the root cause of my headaches and helps me to find ways to manage my own health!. I eagely read Heal Your Headache, as it had helped a friend deal with her migraine headaches.I was exasperated with doctors simply prescribing drugs and not addressing the root causes of my migraine headaches. I have been following Dr. Buchholz approach for a couple weeks and am filled with hope. The headaches are not completely gone yet, but the severity is greatly diminished and my affliated symptoms are dramatically improved.I love the way the book describes the symptoms and what is causing them, in very logical and understandable language. I have already recommended the book to several friends who suffer from headaches.$LABEL$1

Nasty, Hurtful, and Unsocial. I listened to this tape and tried to keep an open mind, hoping it would get better, even though I felt like turning it off a few times. Ms Martinet seems to have a lot of deep, nasty, resentful feelings towards people. Has she been treated badly by a crowd of strangers at one too many cocktail parties? Her advice in dealing with others is to make your self feel superior by putting down everyone else. I work at a school, and we dedicate time to teaching our kids how NOT to act like Ms. Martinet suggests. The snide tone of her voice on this tape emphasises her unkind, unsocial advice. Please, don't follow it.$LABEL$0
Works very well. Like most kids, my children love stickers. I selected this product to create custom stickers, hoping that the stickers could also be removed easily. I am happy to report that this paper appears to work as described. I had no problems printing to this paper and then sticking and un-sticking the creations.Avery has some suggested crafts on its website, but nothing appealing to my children. But there are many ideas on the web. Another possibility is to let them design something on the computer or on paper and then scan it and print it out. I can imagine many other uses for this sticker paper. If they were less expensive, I would use them with my Amazon seller account and just print, stick, and ship. They would also make excellent labels for homebrewing.It would be nice to have a choice of colors, glossy and luster finishes, and finer scoring on the back for smaller stickers. I just wish there were more sheets in the pack!$LABEL$1
A Shroomers Bible. Contains lots of cosmopolitan species. So the book is great for European readers. The ONLY minus is a lack of color photos, but the B&W pictures are good. The book has lots of humour so its very entertaining. A must for your mushroom library.$LABEL$1
A beautiful and important book. Ariel Dorfman is one of the most important writers of our time, and Desert Memories, Journeys Through the Chilean North serves as a testament (and a coda) to the terrible years that began with the military overthrow of President Allende's democratically-elected government in 1973, the repression and horror that followed, the exile of so many who barely survived, such as Dorfman. His car trip through the Chilean North with his wife, Angelica, so many years later, is at once a reflection on those events as he visits concentration camps, clandestine graves, the family of a good friend who was "disappeared" by Pinochet's army, along with an evocation of the beauty of the desert landscape and its earlier, hidden history.$LABEL$1
Absolutely Fabulous. This is probably the best historical novel (or series, as there are seven of them) ever written. Entrancing, vicious, beuatiful, innocent, short-sighted people get caught in this story of fate and destruction. Great, thumbs up!$LABEL$1
Disappointing. I received this complete series with much anticipation as I had never seen the entire series before. Upon opening the package and seeing the dvd discs my anticipation turned to horror as most of the discs are scratched and when played they constantly freeze to the point you can't watch them. I get no enjoyment watching what episodes I can because I wonder what I am going to miss next.$LABEL$0
Great Read. It has been awhile since I have read a book that captured me as much as this one did. Once I read Furies of Calderon, I had to continue immediately on to Academ's Fury, and plan on reading Cursor's Fury next. The plot is very easy for me to get involved in, but then has twists and turns that I wasn't expecting. I like all the characters in the book, and am intrigued to find out what some of their next steps are. My only problem is that they are too captivating, leaving me thinking about them at work, driving, cooking, everywhere!$LABEL$1
Not So Great. After reading everyone's great reviews, I decided to register for this pump. I am sad to say that I could not get a drip out. The suction is very poor and I would have to imagine that it would take a good hour to get any amount of breastmilk to come out if it did work! I am very disappointed in a wasted gift. The only pump that does work is the Medela Pump In Style electric pump, which unfortunately is over $300.00.I would not recommend this pump.$LABEL$0

Best Trophy Deer Book!. David Morris again has put out yet another fantastic trophy deer book and resource that you'll keep and refer to often!

Underimpressed. After reading all of the "rave" reviews from other readers, I must say I couldn't wait to read this book. I read it in one sitting, and I waited for the "laugh outloud" moments, I was ready to giggle. I was only slightly amused. I am from the South and love stories about growing up in the South. We all have our wonderfully eccentric family members that we love to talk about, but I was totally unimpressed with this writer's ability to engage me in the story. It was NOT even close to entertaining.$LABEL$0

Tepid Attempt to Replicate U.S. Blockbusters. Decent film with laughably bad moments where somebody clear said "make me an American blockbuster". Gratuitous attempts to tap into a sense of national pride are tempered by timid nods to cultural relativism.$LABEL$0
A Sea of White Impatiens was better. I wanted to like this book because I really enjoyed A Sea of White Impatiens. Having grown up in the same town as the Gallaghers, I enjoyed all the references to the people from "Roweneck". The main character (or the author's voice) came across as ignorant sometimes and I was getting tired of the arrogant tone. It had an interesting beginning and an intriging middle, but the ending fell flat. The wrap-up was a bit outlandish and conveniently neat, like a Hollywood movie. Perhaps, that is the author's intent.$LABEL$0
Just plain wonderful. Great actors. Great stories. Great writing. Great sets. Great Costumes. And the most stunning colors and textures I've ever seen on screen. Wonderful to watch and enjoy!$LABEL$1
What's all the fuss about?. Whiney, wimpy, nerdy, pop songs. Big deal. We hear this every day. Matchbox 21 or whatever their name is sounds like this, and they suck! Like the one guy wrote, it's Bryan Adams limey style. A few good songs, but no big deal. Have you people never listened to Miles Davis and Gil Evans? Mozart? Johnny Cash? Richard Thompson? Van Morrison? Joni Mitchell? Nina Simone? This word "genius" sure comes easy these days. It used to take Joyce, Melville, Nobel, C.V. Raman. Now we have Adam Sandler and Paddy Mcaloon. They don't have to rock out, but this record just has no balls. Geez!$LABEL$0
Nice deal for a nice price.. Good power and spotting capability for a price quite a bit less than the better known names. I was a little leary at first but that is no longer true.$LABEL$1
Corny and over-rated B movie!. I really like classic movies from the 30's 40's etc but I personally found this movie to be incredibly bad with overacting and corny dialogue! The most over-rated B Movie ever!$LABEL$0
Great for Under Ones!. My son loves this book, and has since he was six months old. It has bright pictures. A couple of words each page and they also tell a story (this seems to be a rare combo). The little frog is so expressive and there is heaps that a parent/reader could talk about to a little one on each page. I'm sure it will continue to be a favourite for some time.$LABEL$1
Intriguing read. This is an easy read written by a brave man with an amazing story and great perspective on war and life.$LABEL$1
Bart's Review of "One Eyed Cat". Ned Wallis is a 11 year old boy that lives in New York city. One night he secretly takes a rifle that he is not allowed to touch and goes outside to shot it one time. He sees a dark shawdow and shots at it. On his way home he sees a face looking down at him from his attic window. One day, while helping a neighbor he sees a wild cat with one eye missing. He thinks back to when he took that one shot at that dark shawdow and wonders if it was him who shot that cat? The book didn't have much action and the characters were not that interesting.$LABEL$0
Just didn't see it.... Okay, first off...I give credit for the cover and title, nice job, but the book itself, I just didn't see the hype about it...the plot was mediocre, if not dull and preditable. Yarni was supposed to be a hustler's wife, but I felt that she kept getting played throughout the book, and the book was poorly edited...fo' real. I give Nikki her props for trying and pushing it out there, but there were some scenes that were not believable and maybe just too over the top and c'mon...I just don't see the moms black mailing all these big time officials just to get Yarn's man out of jail...dude was doing like life or sumthin...and that whole happy ending thing for a drug dealer, finally being let free and reuniting with his girl...c'mon...the moms would have been dead and so on...but once again, I just don't see the hype in this book...$LABEL$0
Best puzzles ever. These Ravensberger puzzles are the best that I have ever seen. This was a gift for a 5 year old girl. She loves this puzzle. It is very well-made of thick Cardboard paper and is of high quality. The colors are vivid and the picture quality is beautiful. These puzzles are made to last. I also found the designs to be very unique and highly artistic. My little ones have several of the large floor puzzles, which are amazing.$LABEL$1
Great Book.A favorite. This is one of my Favorite classics.Any one who reads this will be in suspense and awe.The movie is Great to.Gaston Leroux did an excellent jb with this book.The Phantom and Raoul are both in love with the opera singer Christian Daea.It becomes a desperate struggle for both lovers.Great book for young and old.Loved it!!!$LABEL$1

It's a love/hate thing.... I just purchased my second fan of this style. I have had one for over five years and love it. It's insanely noisy on oscillating, but not bad stationary. However, the new one sounds like it has a piece of plastic hanging off of something inside. When I turn it on, it's so loud I think it's going to blow up. Going to take it back and get something different. I'd recommend based on the first one I owned (if you can live without oscillating), but no recommendation from the new one.$LABEL$0
5 stars does not even begin to cover it..... Thats it.....THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME. I thought that it couldnt get any better than "Outlander"..my God was I wrong! "The Bronze Horseman" is absolutely the most consuming, overwhelming, brilliant story I have EVER gotten my hands on..I am telling you I could not put this book down..yet at the same time, I would force myself to stop reading so that I could make it last longer!!! I have just one thing to say about this book..BUY IT!!!!!!!!!! Girls..a little warning....please..buy "Tatiana and Alexander" asap..it is the follow up book to "The Bronze Horseman"..it is available on amazon U.K. The ending to TBH will make you insane..believe me..you'll want the follow up story!! ENJOY!$LABEL$1
"Intelligent Design" propaganda. This documentary is produced by the fundamentalist christian movement whose agenda it is to get Darwin's theory of evolution banned from schools and have it replaced by "Intelligent Design", which really just means creation, as put forth in the bible. As can be expected from a documentary with an agenda to convince the viewer of a certain point, rather than being open minded, it does not really go anywhere. It keeps repeating the point that "scientists agree" that life could not have developed anywhere else in the universe.The other reviewers here must be people associated with "the cause," this really is not a five star production simply because instead of sincerely investigating the subject with an open mind you get science, contorted to fit religion.$LABEL$0

Don't Go To The Cosmetic Counter At All - Instead Buy PAULA'S Product!!. The first thing that flew out of the book when I took it out of the Amazon box was Paula's advertisement for her own product! I was completely shocked and felt like a dummy! I understand that she may feel, with all her research, she is an expert on the field, and even understand how she could possibly come up with an ideal product....but for goodness sake be SUBTLE!She should at least let the reader discover Paula's product (alphabetically listed)slowly. I can even get past ALL the smiley faces her own product gets, but I definitely don't want an insert to fly out of the book when I first open it. This is completely in poor taste, and I don't feel she can be objective!Having said all this, she may have valid points, she may have done great research, she may have the best product, but I really don't care, as I feel like an ABSLOUTE sucker for spending $20 for buying her advertising gimmick.$LABEL$0
Uniden TRU 3466. bgt the TRU346 after good reviews, memory dim but phone broke within a year, could not hear caller (they could hear me)often could not get dial tone, don't remember what tech support (email) suggested (chg battery, reprogram unit etc), didn't work anyway. Uniden brand name and the reviews on TRU3466 with speakerphone, gave them another chance. # sign on handset died after a few months (try using voicemail systems without the pound #)had to use speakerphone constantly for # sign key. Earpiece is necessity, move around my office a lot, works on and off now, lot of static or no reception at all. I also need earpiece to keep hands free (major reason for speaker phone as well).Bought two phones, less than two years, $180. Big disappointment.Will never buy UNIDEN phone again.$LABEL$0

The Devil in a BORING story. I find the Salem witch trials to be very interesting and I love learning about them. After reading this book however, I am starting to become turned off by them. I am a woman and personally find woman writers to usually be enjoyable. This woman should go back to college or maybe even grade school and find out how to write. She uses complicated sentences that make no sense (you'll need a dictionary or another person to help you out with the meanings of some of her 20-word sentences). Do yourself a favor, pick a different book.$LABEL$0
Excellent. I purchased this book as a beach book and was not disappointed. This is the first work I have read by this author and immediately after finishing Four Seasons began to search for more books by her. This was a wonderfully woven tale of family tragedy and triumph as well as individual growth within the protagonists as women and as sisters.$LABEL$1
Very pleased. I bought this pan not knowing what to expect. The pan has good weight to it and as long as you give the cups a little swirl of butter or olive oil, the eggs come right out without leaving a mess. Takes a few times to get the eggs just right but now that I have it down pat.......I am 100% happy.$LABEL$1
Farting, drinking, getting punched and getting laid. Although well-written enough to want you to turn the page for potential adventure, it never comes. Jaime talks about guy bonding via farting, drinking and getting laid while in town. The book never gets exciting to the point of combat, and that's the purpose of the French Foreign Legion. Why didn't Jaime just enlist in the US army for a tour or two or three to Iraq or Afghanistan? I'm sure he could have come back with excitement, gore and extreme physical and mental challenges to last a life time. I got the impression Jaime just joined the Legion to see if he could pass basic training, and then to write about it later. I read the first 150 pages but got bored and quit...just like Jaime.$LABEL$0
Junk. Stripped the bit on my first try. Most of the bits have off centered holes. Don't buy this at all!!!$LABEL$0
An action thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat!. I first saw "A Theif in the Night," when I was about 9 or 10 years old, and I cannot forget the impact it had on me at that time...it motivated me to witness the love of Jesus to all of my friends. I have seen this movie several times since, and while a product of it's times (early 70's) with bell bottoms, wide sideburns, and mini-skirts, its message is just as pertinent and pressing as when it was made, and impact just as effective; time is short, the harvest plentiful and workers few.$LABEL$1
Disintegrated after 6 months. This cover worked great for a few months. We live in Southern California, where it rained about 3-5 times in the past 6 months. When i went to lift up the cover it ripped. I tried another place it ripped there too. Pretty much any place on the cover I touch it just tears. The material has totally disintegrated from the sun.$LABEL$0
It's all about the Holy Spirit!. This book is the amazing story of what the Holy Spirit can do if you surrender your life to Him. Just read and be encouraged. Your life will never be the same.$LABEL$1
Unapologetically Sexual Nightmare. Make no mistake, this book is unabashed terror porn, with rife, vividly cruel sexuality. It's explicit in terms of both sex and scenes of unimaginable violence, sort of like what "My Life at Rose Red" would be like if it were reimagined by Larry Flynt and Marilyn Manson. Edward Lee's work has appeared in famous horror anthologies including the "Hot Blood" series.If you realise, however, what you are getting into, this book is well-written and a capitvating read. It is not for everyone, and don't read it on an empty stomach, but if you're into terror with a streak of bizarre smut, this is the book for you.$LABEL$1
Simple to use.. I bought this hard drive to store music, movies, etc. I've had it almost two weeks, and here are my impressions so far:Pros: Easy to hook up, plug and play for XP, the stand that comes with it is very sturdy, the hard drive itself feels solid, simple design.Cons: Blue LED on the front is to bright, usable space on the drive only reads as 150 GB, the power brick that comes with the drive is fairly large.Overall, this is a good hard drive for the money. Besides a few design quirks it has, I'd recomend this drive to anyone looking for a inexpensive external HD.$LABEL$1

Great Album, But Flat Production Sound. Like others who have reviewed this album, I agree that it is the best (maybe second best to Rainbow Rising) work that Rainbow ever did. However, since the late 70s, when I initially purchased it, I have always been bothered by the "flat" production sound. The bass and drum sound have no punch. Amazingly, it was produced by Martin Birch, who would later go on to doing great things with Iron Maiden. That's my only complaint. With a better production, this album would be unbelievably good$LABEL$1
Not for young jwomen. I've read reviews and thought that Mariue Claire would be better than Cosmo (it's all about sex in Cosmo) but I'm dissapointed. Marie claire is like in style the whole magazine is just a photos of models and advertisments. There are maybe 2 or 3 articles but they are not so interesting. All in all if you are in your twenties you should choose cosmo or glamour.$LABEL$0
You'll need to either get lucky or keep on returning copies. It's really great to have these films together in what is (visually, anyhow) a very handsome package. On the other hand, as others have complained before me, the reality of the packaging is that the disks break from their cheap clear plastic holding tabs, get scratched, and become unplayable. I've had to return two copies of the FRANKENSTEIN and three of DRACULA before I found acceptable copies.The films themselves are fine and look great, but when the disk freezes or simply refuses to play a film, we're talking significant problems.I also cringe at the advertising aspect of these films (does the director of Van Helsing have anything to tell us about FRANKENSTEIN? Does he even belong on the same disk as horror film historian, David Skal. Nope on both counts.To my mind, these films should be repackaged and customers offered a free upgrade. This is inexcusable hack packaging from a major studio's whose past work has been stellar.$LABEL$0
feeder falls apart...be warned!. I didn't buy our mesh feeder from here, but did want to write a review somewhere to warn other parents. The pin in the hinge falls out after a few months of use, at least. I kept trying to jam it back in and it kept falling apart as our child used it. I turned around 2 days ago and he had the pin and both pieces of the feeder in his hands. The pin is a plastic long piece that could cause a choking hazard. Be warned to not buy this particular feeder. I am trying to find the company's website to write to them about the issues. Our son loved using the feeder so I am going to find another brand that is safer.$LABEL$0
poor quality. poor quality or poor packaging. Every piece was broken on arrival. I never had the opportunity to try the actual product.$LABEL$0
Not good enough. They might sound bad to me because I am used to Audiophile headphones. But they don't sound terrible. Nice clean highs, but the bass is a little muddy. Maybe it will clear up in time as they burn in, but for the price... I especially like the volume control and headphone input. It works excellent and matches my system. But these speakers are great for the price. If I spent 100 on them I would be mad with the sound quality, but for less than 30, they are excellent. I just picked up a new pair of speakers which sound way better than these and they were cheaper too. Check out my other reviews on which speakers I got. These will be sitting in my closet for a backup pair, not worth sending them back.$LABEL$0
not worth getting. the seller shipped it fast but it isn't worth your money because the hair falls everywhere and creates a mess. I suggest getting the new one as seen on t.v. where it has a holder that holds the hair so it doesn't get everywhere around the house. Don't waste your money on this!!!!!$LABEL$0

Always something happenning. I found Darkfall to be very enjoyable. If this had been the first Dean Koontz (DK) book that I had read then I would definitely have given it a 5 star rating but having read most of DK's books, I gave it 4 stars. I reduced the rating knowing that he has written better work but it is still a very good read. The story is non stop action so gets you in quickly. It may be unrealistic but it is never boring. He has the most amazing imagination and style of writing. When I read his books, I can picture all he writes and feel the emotion and tension. It's like having a movie playing in my head. Darkfall didn't let me down at all. I loved the suspense in the chase and the bit of romance.The authors note was also interesting.Don't hesitate. Buy the book. You wont be sorry.$LABEL$1
Disappointed. Do not be fooled by the description of this book. It is very much a book only about African American history. If you were looking for something more middle of the road that shows the flaws that our kids learn in history class these days, this book is not for you. It doesn't exactly "set the record straight". It merely amplifies what we are forced to hear about everyday. Overall a disappointing read for me.$LABEL$0
GeoTrax Track Layout Manual. The GeoTrax Train System is a great addition to your kids toy collection! It provides hours of fun and enjoyment for both you and your child.I found some "Track Layout Manuals" for the GeoTrax Rail System on eBay. If you've become frustrated with the track assembly process, then this is the answer. Volumes 1, 2 and 3 are available on eBay.Search for "Geotrax layout" and you will find all three volumes. These layout designs were designed on a computer using CAD software and are of very high quality. It is well worth checking it out.$LABEL$1
Does not live up to its purpose. Although this book is for beginners, it is very problematic. I think the publishing company farmed this project out to a developer without telling this person that the book was for beginners. The book starts out with a good primer of object oriented principles but then jumps into advanced stuff such as creating listeners. It does not lay out the lesson plans well the little cartoon graphics are supremely annoying. Other books in this series have been pretty helpful but this one is a bit of a disaster. If anyone finds a good introductory text for Java programming, please let me know.$LABEL$0

What a delight!. The Encores production of "Face the Music" last March was one of the highlights of the New York theater season. Here is a wonderful relic of the days when the theater existed so that people could have silly fun.

If you love classic musical theater, you will want this recording.$LABEL$1
A Must Own for All Shooter Fans. This game is one of the best games available on the Xbox 360 and is worth every penny. I've owned this game for about a year now and still play it every once in awhile. I have beaten the game on all 3 difficulties (Casual, Hardcore and Insane) and they are all very fun and challenging. The graphics are great, sound is even better and the controls are easy to use and very fluid. Don't spend your money on other games if you don't own this one first!$LABEL$1
Not so hot, badly worded questions. This book tries to be an "exam cram" but ends up being a badly abridged version of the massive Training Guide (ISBN 0789728222). There are page-consuming examples that don't add much, and yet key facts are missing. These facts do surface in the Exam Prep Questions, which at least informs the reader that they need to go research that topic, but those points should appear in the text. Questions are often badly worded; their intent is only explained by reading the answers.The authors should consider a re-write. Cut useless examples. Include code snippets with the minimum required context instead of the full "Create a new solution, add a page named blah, add these 5 controls..." Tighten up the prose; make it clear and concise for easy review. Cut the fluff, not the facts.$LABEL$0
Simply Hypnotic. The guitarist in my old band once shared the best suggestion with me. To listen to American Fooball. I am forever in his debt- for this alone. This album by American Football is one of the most remarkable things that I have ever heard. These songs are completely emotional, and stunningly heartbreaking. When I first heard it, I instantly grew to love it. I wanted to hear it constantly. I began playing it over and over and it never left my CD player for months on end. The beautiful guitar work, the extremely talented drumming, the soft spoken lyrics, and the pure comfort of this recording made me an instant fan. I was horrified to hear that they had dismembered, even before the record was put out. But I strongly urge everyone to listen and purchase this album. Unfortunately, this music is too impresive for words. You seriously must experience it first hand- and you won't be disappointed.$LABEL$1
Great Pop Album ... 3 Cheers For Baby!. Emma, (the 3rd current spice to release a solo) has done an excellent job with this album. she has used her soft, beautiful voice to make sweet sweet music.

It sounds awesome. when it comes here, i defintily recommend it.$LABEL$1
Path of Daggers was an amazing novel in an amazing series.. Path of Daggers, the 8th book of the Wheel of Time series, lived up to the previos masterpeices in the series and made me crave for more.

potential: untapped.. this film had the potential to be funny... a weird enough plot, a talented enough cast... but it relied on vulgarness and poor dialogue to simply carry it through what could have been funny situations.it wasn't funny, it was sad.if this really happened it would not have made anyone's life better or worse- they just would have continued spinning out of control on this rock...i think it was the direction & the editing that really was below par on this film, through- because even with not-bad performances the timing was just off with the jokes & situations...$LABEL$0
Saccharine Sickly Sweet. If you have a taste for hyper-earnest sentiment and treacle, this is the CD for you.If the very notion of some "spiritual" composer navel-gazing and pondering life as "The Artist at 40" makes you gag, run in the other direction!!!$LABEL$0
I don't understand how anyone can like this. This movie is not scary and sloppy efforts were made by everyone! I didn't even laugh at how bad it was, I was just angered. But I guess that's my fault for renting it and not listening to the reviews and just wanting to see gore.$LABEL$0
Abridged CD is empty..... CD/abridged/Romantic Suspense: A friend loaned me the paperback a few years back and it was okay. This abridged version was not at good as the paperback. It was very empty and I disliked the townspeople more in this version. There were so many plot holes and red herrings. The police procedure stuff was completely unrealistic. The narrator did a great job.$LABEL$0
Very Bad Writing. I bought this book because I was intrigued about telling a story that took place after the show had ended. All I can say is, the writing is horrible and resembles nothing of the Buffy characters and world. Much of the dialogue is corny and no character would be caught dead saying it, and being as the smart dialogue of the characters is one of the things that attracted me to the show, I must warn people to be wary before purchasing this book.$LABEL$0

It's a fantastic photo album as well as a great source of history, information, etc. etc.$LABEL$1
Absolutely Terrible. After only about three months of use this has already broken down on me. It won't hold a charge anymore. I hope Homedics is aware of all these bad reviews of their product. This product is simply not made to withstand a typical bathroom environment. The housing is made such that water and toothpast will seep in no matter how you use it. The brushhead will stop working in about a months worth of use as the combined water and grime will stop it from working. Did they even test this thing themselves? What were they thinking......... A bathroom product that is not waterproof and is intended to be used near water is just mind boggling. Brushing with it was okay, but the quality and design of the product leave MUCH to be desired. STAY AWAY from this product.$LABEL$0
Love, Love, Love - You need this.. This product is so fantastic I have bought three of them, one for each room my daughter may fall asleep in. We have the pink ladybug, the red ladybug and the twilight turtle. The stars are so sweet to look at and provide a nice nightlight for the little ones. it's really cool that the stars actually show constellations and the story book that comes with the package is fun.The auto turn off feature is great and seems to be the perfect amount of time for my daughter to fall asleep. It's small enough to be portable (we schlep it to grandma's house regularly) but a good size for kids to cuddle with too. Some of our friends came over with their kids, who are a couple years older than ours, and flipped when they found the ladybug. This is great for infants all the way to pre-teens. Heck, even my husband and I will put one in our room some nights because it's so fun to look at.I highly recommend this. You need it.$LABEL$1

Is NOT leak proof. I too bought one of these lunch bowls at Target and I can confirm that it indeed is not leak proof. My son started school and wanted soup. When I picked him up the teacher informed me that his soup leaked all over his lunch bag and book bag, making his folder and books all wet! There is a small hole in the slot where the take along spoon is (I assume for ventilation) and when I ran water on the underside of the lid I confirmed that it leaked through this hole. It also only does a marginal job of keeping food hot. When we sent spaghetti or pierogies they were only room temp come lunch time. Again I assume this is because of the small hole in the lid.$LABEL$0

Mouth boogers made me stop.. After using Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse, I would awaken the next morning with some stringy, ropey goo in the bottom of my mouth and alongside the lower margins of my teeth. Was it the dreaded stains coming off my teeth?? NOPE.I contacted customer service at Listerine (Pfizer) and got a smarmy runaround. "We are not your doctor or dentist if you want to know what it is, you need to contact them"......I contacted my dentist who advised that this was sloughing cells from the lining of my mouth, and that this was a common allergic/ sensitivity reaction to chemicals in mouth care products.He suggested that stopping using Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse would be the right thing to do.One star to the product, and ZERO stars to Listerine/Pfizer for not having the guts to tell me that this was not normal and was cells sloughing off the inside of my mouth.$LABEL$0
Good noise level. I was traveling to family for vacation and they have paper thin walls and this there be a lot of KIDS playing throughout the house and I would not be able to keep them quote. We decided on this model because of the reviews. I was surprised that the price for a good noisemaker would cost so much but that's what it is.I have to say that for using this in a house with very thin walls and having a lot family and kids around in other rooms even playing in another room close to were my 11 months old baby was sleeping. Still with all the noise he didn't wake up from everyone else in the house and he was able to have naps during the day with no disturbance.Pros: Good noise levelsCons: Price is a little high just for a noisemakerAll in all; I WOULD recommend this as THE noisemaker to get, going by experience and others that I know that use this too!$LABEL$1
careful -- these are not the original versions!. Note that the track listing on the product page lists only song titles, not artists -- if you order this sight unseen, you may be disappointed to find that these are re-recordings, not the original versions of the songs!

Does not work with Windows XP. Contrary to what Linksys state and say on their packaging this product does not work with Windows XP.I am currently pursuing legal action against Linksys as they will not refund the purchase but only replace it with the same product. This has already been done and it's the same problem.Do not purchase any Linksys wireless products as even though you may be lucky enough to get some working, there technical support is useless and they continuously lie to you.$LABEL$0

GPSlim 240 on a BlackBerry 8100. This device is great for what I purchased it for. It paired without any trouble to my blackberry pearl. The pictures don't do it justice on how tiny it is. It did not work properly with my laptop connected via USB. This appears to because of the driver provided doesn't work properly. It does not create the virtual com port that is needed to interface with most GPS software.$LABEL$1
best wrestlmaia ever. this event was pretty good. the billy gunn/holly/snow match was a great opener. the tag match was boring. the brawl for all was really short good thing too. show/mankind was entertaining. roaddogg/shamrock/venis/goldust was excellent. the kane/hhh match was average. the sable/torri was boring. xpac/shane was average. the hell in a cell was horrible. and the rock/austin was the best. here is wrestlmaia in the order of how good they were.15 16 14 4 6 10 5 12 7 8 9 1 2 11 13.$LABEL$1

Good. Rosie is adopted by a family with different coloring than her own hair. This book expresses some of the anxiety that adopted children may feel such as anger and sadness at their birth parents and adoption parents. Being an adoptive mother, I felt that a little more positive spin could have been placed on the story. There are only one or two pages of happiness for the adoptive family. I recommend reading with the time to share and explore all elements of this story with your child.$LABEL$1
Poor reliability. After some time researching printers, I decided on this one. I received my printer as a christmas present in Dec 2004. As of today, July 2005, I am now on to my second printer, the motherboard having failed on the original. Today, I suspect that the same thing has happened again, as with the first one I could no longer turn it on. I'm beginning to think that I will simply ask for a refund and get a different printer by another manufacturer.$LABEL$0
Dumbest movie in years.. Is this supposed to be art? Because it has no other value, other than perhaps for the purpose of studying the effects of boredom on the human psyche. I kept expecting the main character to be a hero, instead he's just a loser. I can appreciate a movie without a hero (i.e. Being John Malkovich) but can't they at least make the loser character someone who does something...anything...interesting?Also, the other characters are really weak. The best potential characters, the grandma for example, are barely ever on screen.I thought this movie would be like Rushmore, and I couldn't have been more wrong.I will say one thing positive about it, though, there is a scene where Napolean goes to jump his bike on a ramp and instead just plows through it - a really funny gag, I have to admit...most of us have done something like that.In summary, might be worth it if you can rent it cheap and get a backup movie, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.$LABEL$0
A Major Disappointment. Neil Finn is without doubt one of the best songwriters of this era. With Crowded House his tunes were mixed with ever more innovativness reaching a pinnacle with Together Alone, among the best albums of the last decade. Try Whistling This sadly shows that he needs a tight unit to breathe life and energy into his songs. There are exactly two outstanding tracks on this release, the catchy summer tune She Will Have Her Way and the spooky Sinner. Most of the rest lacks the spark that Crowded House seemed to produce in their sleep. A few tracks are even hardly b-side material. Neil obviously needs a group of musicians around him, not session players, to highlight his own talents.$LABEL$0
Good tips, though somewhat out of date.. This book has great training tips for puppies and dogs, lots of critical exercises to practice with you're dog. I would say though that some of the author's explanations of wild dogs/wolves is based on out-of-date information, and one can find many newer books & articles on wolf & dog hierarchy. I think some of the tips given also can easily be done wrong or poorly, so anyone who picks up this book should be sure to read through the whole thing and not just attempt to pick certain exercises to attempt without understanding Kilcommon's overall philosophy.$LABEL$1

must be for older kids. Bumble bee kids makes a series of 5 dvd's that are done very well, and geared for the 6month-2 year old. My 6 month old has watched some of them every day and never gets tired of them. I bought this aphabet video by bumble bee kids for him when he was 19 months, and the kids in the video do not speak clearly, and sometimes whisper the words. My son asked me to turn it off by the time we were at the letter "H". They should use the little girl who does the singing in their body parts video. She has personality, and can speak clearly, and babies love her. This video is going to the goodwill I am afraid. The kids speak with lisps in this video.$LABEL$0
Good-story wanna-be. Eliza Blake is a beautiful news anchorwoman who enters your home, and the homes of thousands just like you, every day. For some, this isn't enough. Eliza has multiple "stalkers" sending her sick messages in the mail and on her phone. She and her five year old daughter are being threatened and it must end, before someone ELSE dies.This had the makings of a really great story. In my opinion, it just didn't say all it should have. The main character, Eliza, should have done everything in her power to protect herself and her daughter. She really didn't do squat. She simply stood back, making observations. The writing was very predictable and matter-of-fact; I felt no suspense or any other emotions, for that matter. The dialog was very dull and rigid, like the words were simply pulled from a dictionary. I yelled at the book a couple times. You'll need a little patience with this one.$LABEL$0
RIP OFF ARTISTS!!!. For this album, My Chemical Romance just copies the melodies and song structures on bands such as the Styx and Queen. Go and compare "Come Sail Away" by the Styx with "Welcome to the Black Parade". They are ironically similar. Even the singing tone is almost an exact replica of the lead singer of Styx. For several months, I even thought it was the Styx!!!Being a musician myself, I can appreciate well written music from an original band but when their is nothing original about it, there is not much I can say but SAVE YOUR MONEY!$LABEL$0

Why isn't this labeled as a short story?. It is really annoying to start reading a book only to find out that it is a short story.

A great read. This book is exciting and captivating. It captures the challenges of Military life starting in boot camp and progressing on through the war in Viet Nam. I've read the book twice, once a long time ago and then again recently. I feel like I know the author personally. He bares his heart and soul in this book. It's written in present tense as if the scenes had been accurately recorded. I don't know how the author could do that so well, he must have a detailed journal or a photographic memory (or maybe both). I highly recommend this book however, be aware that it is filled with foul language, but only because that was the language of the military at the time.$LABEL$1
Don't judge this book by its title!. OK, now I know to read reviews! A better title for this book would have been, Life Coaching Educational Options. This book appears to have been "cut & pasted" from the Internet. I bought it as a less expensive option than coaching school, not to read a list of schools!The "book" is a great list of schools that have easy-to-find websites. The list compiler probably spent a full day or two on www.google.com to find, block, cut and paste this "book."The title is very deceptive!On the flip side though, $12.95 + S&H is not a bad price for a reminder that the world is filled with unscrupulous folks! From this perspective the book was well worth every penny!Perhaps the author could next compile a list of porn sites, call it a book and title it "How to Have a Loving Relationship."$LABEL$0
a nice departure from Radiohead. I will start off by saying that this solo album from radiohead frontman Thom Yorke will not have mass appeal . This album is almost entirely electronic , and minimalistic in it's approach . Sufficed to say , it is destined to alienate the casual listener . However , if you enjoy lush , ambient electro-soundscapes with emotive vocals ( and you are not a card carrying member of the A.D.D. generation ) then you may like this very intimate and personal album . Essentially , this is a stripped-down Radiohead . Thom Yorke seems to have a re-newed sense of purpose , he isn't just going through the motions like on previous -RH- albums . This is his most inspired work in years .$LABEL$1
great third album. I don't really need to tell anyone who has heard BHC to check this album out because they are probably listening to it right now just as I am......if you haven't heard boy hits car they can be (roughly) compared to bands like system of a down, tool, rage, nonpoint, pulse ultra ... this is a great album, favorite song right now is All the Love We Hold InsideGET THIS ALBUM!$LABEL$1
Not even close. I wear a size 13 or 14 depending on the manufacturer. This shoe stretcher wouldn't even touch the sides on my size 13 Rockports. They were a little tight, so I wanted to loosen them up.It was ridiculous how far from "stretching" they were. I would guess there was at least a half inch of space in the shoes when the "stretchers" AND the little knobs were fully extended. Without the knobs it probably would have been an inch. I mean they say up to size 14, but I would be shocked if they could stretch my wife's shoes. I'm returning them because they wouldn't even be useful for her.$LABEL$0

Wonderful. My class was recently assigned this book to read to go along with our unit on Africa. Cry, The Beloved Country was filled with extrodinary passages that made me feel the pain and suffering of a country under a time of great turmoil.

It's rare for a teen title to be so well crafted and the dialogue so adult and inviting.. This was really interesting and intelligent book, aside from the many misnomers about my home state of Washington, and some issues that were not fully developed like Bella's attraction of danger and near death experiences hopefully the next two installments will explore these issues. I loved this book despite of those flaws and I am anxious to engage in one of the sequels. It's rare for a teen title to be so well crafted and the dialogue so adult and inviting. I think the size and subject matter will put off some teens but those that pick it up will not be able to put it down, nor will they be able to stop wondering what will be come of Bella in the next book.$LABEL$1
Short but ever so worth it. Even though the season is only 13 episodes long due to Emily Deschanel's pregancy all 13 are some of the best body of work bones has ever done.

Good book for our times.. This book could be seen by some as an allegory of modern conservative-Republicanism run amok. A CEO traffics in human cargo and destroys indigenous tribal cultures to provide cheap labor for his company and protect against corporate espionage. The haves (Salts, Teavees, Gloops, etc.) all grow wealthier, fatter and more demanding at the expense of the hardworking have-nots (the Buckets.) Overweight children, kids with ADHD and post-feminist loud-mouths are skewered, while the child who keeps his mouth shut and plays by the rules of corporate culture is the ultimate winner.$LABEL$1

Hold the Mayo please, but bring me the butter. A very nice discovery. Their sound thunders with wild frentic guitars, swanky and screamy vocals, a tight drum section... and you get The Detatchment Kit.

Great product with a great catch.. I just bought this product. Looks nice and slick. However, the box says it is wireless ready but they don't include the adapter. Even worse, you can't use another adapter than a Samsung. On top of that, the damn adapter costs $80, where you can get a regular adapter for $15!That's not an honest strategy from Samsung. And even though I can afford the adapter, I will return the product.$LABEL$0

S&B Hot Mustard Powder. Received this item promptly and was very pleased to get it. The mustard is good and hot. Directions say to use cold water to mix, but I used warm water from a tea kettle that had cooled and the results were very good with no lumping. It isn't mustard if it's not hot! The only thing I was concerned about was that there was no ingredient label and as I have diet limitations I wasn't really sure what it contained other than ground mustard seed.$LABEL$1

The Untamed. I first read this book when I was a young boy and was much impressed. I never forgot it. I recently read it again (I'm now 75) and thought that the story was still entertaining but not like it had been when I was younger. I would recommend it to young readers$LABEL$1
Get ready to yawn.. This is a mediocre movie pumped to 5 stars by blatant sock-puppetry. I rarely see an Amazon DVD with 5 stars and over 100 reviews. On that basis alone I purchased _A Dog's Breakfast_. Mistake.At first I thought what I was seeing here were a contingent of vocal Stargate fans, too besotted with their favorite actors appearing in a non-genre venue to see its limitations.After further reflection, it's pretty clear to me that most of the reviews were written by one or two people. Read a dozen of the 5 star reviews and you'll begin to hear the same screechy voice coming out of the mouths of nearly one hundred sock puppets.This is not a good movie.Don't get me wrong--it isn't a terrible movie either. But the capable acting doesn't save this tepid comedy from a poorly structured plot and lackadaisical pacing. I snickered a few times but was otherwise bored throughout.$LABEL$0
Sadness. this game is amazing.I just wish they told me in the description that it will not work on a windows 7 machine.$LABEL$0
Rip Off. This DVD is garbage. It is totally unviewable. And all I can hear is something about the Muhamed Ali and Frazier fight in Ziare. I was looking forward to seeing the movie after having read the book. But I guess I can't. At least not from this vendor.$LABEL$0
THE IDEAL ALBUM. well what can i say, only that this album is a perfect album! if you know deus then you know that every song of them is played with so much instruments and it's just like being in an orcestra of rock.the song 'instent street' is an amazing piece of art,also highlights - 'magdalena','the magic hour' and if to be honest all the 10 tracks are highlights .i recommend this album to people who like to try something new,something pure,something that can change you.$LABEL$1

This guy can really sing!. Most of the songs on this cd are great! There are pretty ballads like "She's All I Ever Had" to great dancing beats like "Spanish Eyes." There's even some in-between stuff like "Private Emotion." He seriously can sing too. His voice is really really good and not to mention he included the words so you can actually know what he's singing. I hate it when artists don't put the words in!$LABEL$1
Stupid. I like Mary Roberts Rinehart, but this is one of her worst books. It is about a 16-17 year old who wants to be like her 20 month older sister. "Bab" gets into too many stupid problems. I found nothing funny about this book. I kept reading it thinking it would get better. It never did.$LABEL$0
Give this a try. This is the first time I have used this product.I read about it in magazines so thought I would see how it works with my skin. I certainly am pleased with the results, you actually feel your skin "freeze" just after you apply it - it gives you a feeling your skin is becoming firmer. None of my friends have commented on the difference but I see it myself and if I feel good, then to me I must look good (and not the other way round). I would give it a try.$LABEL$1

meh. The first movie was funny, maybe a little corny... but good. This one is a pathetic, extremely corny sequel... but the filming of this one is totally different than the first so not even sure it's a real sequel.

Buyer Beware: SERIOUS Quality Control Issues!!. We hated, hated, HATED this thing...'cause despite purchasing THREE of them, we never really got to play with one! Even though it IS cute, plays fun music, and appears to have the potential to be a lot of fun, we actually purchased THREE seperate Twirlin' Whirlin' Gardens three seperate times, and EVERY SINGLE time we got one home and took it out of the box, it was broken!! One time we had one of the little belts inside break (this is similar to a vaccuum cleaner), another time the little plastic gears inside were broken, etc. Makes me wonder if there's any quality control at Fisher-Price at ALL, since many other people seem to have had a lot of fun and success with this thing. We had no such luck! So, my caution to the world is this: be careful buying this thing. I find it hard to believe that we would have gotten THREE bad eggs just by chance.$LABEL$0
Marketing is the devil. As a child I loved these books. They were exciting but in a safe way and they really told a great story of a young girl finding a place where she is loved. However, that place was not in a pile of hay with farmer Jed. Let's stop the stupidity and actually make covers that work. It isn't like people haven't heard of the books before. I know you have to market to the weakest link, but I really don't think that someone who had never heard of the books would be happy with the story based on the cover. As someone who did like the books, I would be embarrassed to be seen reading this version in public. If you want to be lazy, just take a picture of a farm house or a field and put that on the cover. Don't hire some 30 year old actress to tart it up country style.$LABEL$0
Very difficult to program, poor performance. The beeping part comes with a plastic stick and an array of buttons to program. You have to be a genius/scientist to get it all figured out. You will have to open the unit and use the stick to change the music.We lost the stick, so now we are having difficulty with the product. Anyway, the product is not working even after 3 weeks. We have broken the easy clip and had to pay for replacements which in my opinion are not worth it.I was waking up 3 times a night and cleaning the sensor with a toothbrush as recommended. In one week, it's all rusty and potentially dangerous. Nope, this isn't going to work for us.$LABEL$0
Not bad!. I enjoy this CD a lot. For a moment I thought these songs would sound horrible but I found them to be really cool! If you are a fan of children's CD's, this CD is certainly for you.$LABEL$1

This is a joke.. Those 3 to 5 minutes routines are jokes. There is no way we can get "fit" in that time. There is no such a miracle. Definitely, this DVD does not worth the money.

Absolutely Useless. I was very excited, but i should have listened to the other reviews on this product. It sharpened about half of the first pencil and then stalled.

I am returning it and will not be buying anything from X-acto ever again!!!$LABEL$0
Prin Trio Photo Printer. This is quite possibly the worst printer I have ever owned!!! The Cannon I had was awesome and then I made the mistake of buying "refilled ink" as I am sure a lot of people have done and totally botched their printers like I did! This Lexmark printer is not worth $25.00 much less the $95.00 my husband paid for it at WalMart! It is lame and these people are right in saying it is slow and doesn't print photo's well at all even with the photo cartridge! Cartridges are very expensive as well--black more than $28.00 and color more than $35.00! Hope you find this helpful! By the way--notice it's not on the market anymore.$LABEL$0

One of the best books ever!. This book was a wonderful, humorous story that should be read and enjoyed by everyone! Toilet Paper Tigers kept my family and I in peels of laughter.

Duh, which way did he go, George? Which way, which way???. As far as I'm concerned, everything after "Contra La Corriente" has been a disappointment. That CD had it all: erotic as well as sublime love lyrics. His self titled album left me stunned with how pedestrian and stupefyingly bland it was. I expected something much more sophisticated, I mean - this is Marc Anthony. I love Marc's voice and talent, and I understand he wants to try different styles but it's confusing to fans and eventually dilutes his fan base. He should stick to what he does well while learning to write music. Learning an instrument (guitar? piano? a la Alejandro Sanz) wouldn't hurt either.$LABEL$0
Trash. How in the world did this book get published? I don't think the author did very much research before writing it! Some of his opinions, interspersed with fact just makes it worse. Some of his historical references are seriously lacking and blatantly wrong! This was a huge waste of money.$LABEL$0
Not for 2 yr old. If the child doesn't know what is going on, this floater is useless. My son is year and a half. I couldn't trust on this equipment to keep his head above water.

I love the popcorn, too bad I can't get it through Amazon. Twice they sent me cartons of the wrong variety. Once it was "Movie Theater Butter," forgot what they sent the other time.I was credited back for my purchase, because they are unable to receive returned food products. They never were able to successfully fill the order, and we gave up.I love this particular product, it contains 0% transfats, low salt, yet it is delicious and tastes as sweet as candy to me.Unfortunately, I will have to rely on my local supermarket, which is often out of the product$LABEL$0
Water proof is the only good thing -. The Olympus 720SW is great for in water shots and movies - surfing, snorkeling and boating. However, the good things end there. The camera (7.1MP) takes poor images for your average (out of water) shot. The shots are blurry and it is hard to find the proper settings in each condition. The Xd card is super slow, takes several seconds before the camera is ready to shoot again. My suggestion buy the canon elf and just take the extra time to put it in a waterproof housing. My 4MP canon elf takes a much better quality image. I will not buy another Olympus product, my next camera will be the 7.1MP canon elf.$LABEL$0

At age 70, I really don't feel like doing that!Does anyone know if FP 2003 will work on Win XP? OR How can I get my FP 2000 to work on my WIN XP computer?$LABEL$0
Pre-teen fiction!. Silly book, reminding me of my childhood favorite, Nancy Drew. As an adult reader, however, this book is childish, predictable driverish! A waste of time to read, unless you are 11 years old!$LABEL$0
weak. did not like this at all. It did not spread around me and i was cold.. i felt like this was saving water ... and it was not comfortable. Ended up buying the Delta 75152 and it was MUCH better! save your time and let me tell you which one to get. I bought two of the Deltas in the end$LABEL$0
Poor Oral-B Electric Toothbrush Design. I purchased this Oral-B Precision Clean 4 pack replacement head. I bought this particular model because of its lower price, expecting to receive the best bang for my buck. After few weeks of use, the brush head became loose and wobbling. The worst part is the toothbrush pinched my lips and tongue. I tried to use the other three and they wound up the same way. Oral-B, what has happened to your quality control? I am sure you must know about the flaw in this product by now. If you cannot it fixed, I suggest you take your name off of it.$LABEL$0
Classic Sarah. Dispite bad critic reviews, I truly enjoied this album. It's a more mature, introspective Sarah, and very refreshing considering the current trend in popular music. If you like her previous albums...this is a sure bet.$LABEL$1
Not worth your money. Badly written. Characters feel indistinct and are uninteresting. There doesn't seem to be a purpose to the story, and the whole novel lacks a purpose. I quit a little more than half way through.$LABEL$0
Beginning of the Alphabet Soup.... I've been hearing about Sue Grafton's alphabet series forever and decided to give it a try. I did read N is for Noose a couple of years ago and liked it. Now, I've bought the first three volumes of the omnibus forms of the book and am starting from the beginning. A is for Alibi is a lighter mystery than I'm used to reading, with hints of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum. All in all, a nice, entertaining read.$LABEL$1
Love this album. This is a great album. Mike Muir and friends lay down some great tracks. All you cycos out there will love it.$LABEL$1

Horrible. Horrible may just be to mild a description of what I thought of this book and I am not normally this harsh. I desperately tried to get through chapter 3 but couldn't torture myself any further. It was bad enough forcing myself through the first two chapters. It just ran on and on, hard to follow, just seemed to be a lot of rambling on to me.$LABEL$0

remington shaver MS2-390. Excellent. I heard shavers weren't as good anymore as in the past, but this one is the best I've ever had. I especially like the automatic shift to 220 in foreign countries, and the touch-up head that comes up parallel to the regular heads.$LABEL$1
Old information, precedes Sarbanes Oxley. Not only is this an infomercial for CCBN, the investor relations website vendor, but the information is now very out of date. The book was written at a time when CCBN's advice was that a corporate governance section on your IR website consisted of a list of your directors with little or no biographic detail, and a list of company managers with perhaps a short bio on each. We have come a long way since then, and so has CCBN, but this book, like many to do with the fast changing Internet, is now stale. You would do better to read www.irwebreport.com or www.irbp.org, or even visit the sites of CCBN and Shareholder.com.$LABEL$0
100% Recommend - Great Little Grinder. Everybody knows freshly ground beans make better coffee. This litle grinder is fast, efficient, durable and makes just the perfect grind for the morning ritual.

Great vitamins but poor shipping. My first order was for both New Chapter Every Woman and Every Man. When the package arrived there was almost nothing in the box to protect the content. One of the bottles was broken, I mean it was salted it wasn't just cracked. I returned it and I had to pay the shipping back. I ordered it again and when it arrived it was poorly packed like the first one. It was just luck that it wasn't broken. So I don't know if that's how they always pack those and we have to cross our fingers that the package will arrive intact with 50/50 chance or they just knowingly sent me a broken one the first time. And what's with the return shipping fee..?For all those troubles I'll give 2 stars only. The vitamins themselves are great.$LABEL$0

Somebody should have like, hipped an editor, Lord and Lady.. Like so many bios today, there's a good book in here somewhere. But as wrought, Dig Infinity is an absurdly long, poorly edited work. Oliver gets all kinds of facts wrong and is egregious when it comes to people's names (Preston STURGIS? CINDY Miller for Donald O'Connor's sidekick instead of SIDNEY Miller? And that's just two). What a shame that such a great subject and such obviously hard work have actually done the impossible...made Lord Buckley boring. The best way to read this book is to skip much of Trager's endless and repetitive analysis of his Lordship's work and just peruse the oral histories.$LABEL$0
From Zero to Unfortunately, Duality. When I first heard Ra's "From Zero" I was in awe. A band that used cool effects, Egyptian scales, and was moderately heavy--the perfect mix for me. Then, Duality came out.Duality demonstrates a lack of creativity that was once there in Ra. I wouldn't say they evolved, I'd say they devoled. They still use effects, but rarely and they don't have as big of an impact. On top of that they hardly sound Egyption on the album. As for this album, Ra sounds more like other bands, but they are still distinct. I just wish they went in a different direction.I do want to say that their are some really awesome songs like Fallen Angels, Undertaken, and Taken. The other tracks are bad either, it's just that I expected a whole lot more.$LABEL$0

Very mediocore bag.. I have this bag which is now a few years old. I bought it for a entry level bag bag to use for backpacking etc., The big problem is that the 20f rating is pretty far off even when using a good thermarest. From my experience, even though 20f is a survival rating, using this bag in anything below high 40f's you will be in for a very cold night(this is coming from someone who likes to sleep slightly cold).Also the zipper only goes halfway down which can make it difficult to get in and out, and makes the bag feel really small.$LABEL$0

Magnificent. Ok, it's not the four hour A&E version but you will be amazed at how much they packed into this version while still staying true to the book. Keira Knightley is completely engaging and infectious as Elizabeth. I found Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy a little to "mushy" at times, but over all delightful. Keira's Elizabeth is witty and sharp. An enjoyable way to spend the evening.$LABEL$1
Extra thick, high density neoprene.. My wife bought two of these for me and they are my favorite Koozie. The neoprene is thicker than any of my others and is very soft and flexible. The bottom is just as thick so no cold gets out down below. I have had them for about 2 years now, and they still look great and work wonderful. They are top notch.$LABEL$1
if you want to teach your child how. Dividing the nation so deeply into two black and white parties is confusing for a young kid. Blaming a group for the troubles of a nation is not nationalism: it divides a country.The problem I have with this book is not that it is indoctrinating - as suggested - but that it ingrains in children an unhealthy sense of political antagonism.A conservative viewpoint should be taught in a more moderate way, explaining the reasons and the benefits. Otherwise, the opinion seems to radical and in early adolescence, the child may rebel entirely in the opposite direction.$LABEL$0
Dickensian. Dalrymple's argument is essentially that the poor have made many stupid choices, and that the rest of us therefore owe them nothing.Of course some people make bad choices; this is obvious. But Dalrymple's diagnosis of the problems of the lower class are based on his experiences with convicted criminals and with psychiatric patients. What kind of book would he have produced if he had worked with white-collar criminals and patients at a celebrity rehab center?Dalrymple's brand of concern was parodied well by Charles Dickens in Hard Times: a wish that the poor would simply stop being poor. Does it all come down to the individual? Well-written, but as cruel as any other social darwinist tract.$LABEL$0

Clever, overrated, but you need to read it!. The Dark Knight Returns is a Batman story, to be sure: dark, edgy, full of gadgets, villains, and of course, Robin.There are interesting storytelling techniques, most mentionable is the use of a television newscast to tell much of the story. Clever, I thought.But.. this comic is overrated. Not that it's not a good story, and well presented in all the visuals, but it's not to par with all the critic's talk. The story being written in the eighties must be taken into account, so the plot twists and other references don't really hit today's audience.This is, however, a must-have addition to any serious graphic novel enthusiast, Batman fan, or aspiring artist. The reference value alone makes it worth the read, if not the buy.-The GlowWormP.S. A good animated version of some of the events is in the new Batman animated series in an episode called "Legends of the Dark Knight," I believe. Check it out.$LABEL$1
Check it out!. This book is such an accurate read on your personality, it is a must have! Miss Meghan perfectly describes every woman based on the types of shoes they wear.

It seems like all these stipper stories are always the same.. This book is too expensive for the contents. The book covers why women strip in clubs, then it goes on through many chapters of explanations, but in the end it tells us that it's because they make good money and fast. The book goes on to explain a strippers percetion of her job, then it goes on to tell us that strippers go through greatlengths to justify what they do and how they blame society, x-relationships, family and others, but never themselves. The book goes through many interviews, all of which are very much common and related. A good girl strips to finance her education, to support her children after her man leaves her or to support a drug habit. Or the most common, but not admitted, just for the money. This good is well written, but the story about all these stippers are all the same in this book and on every television review or movie. I wish this book would have covered something new, useful or insightful.$LABEL$0
Ingersoll-Rand website doesn't match documentation. After much research, and reading everyone's reviews, I purchased the IR 2130. I opted for the 2130 over the 2132 because based on information on Amazon and Ingersoll-Rand corporate website, it appeared the specs for two were very closely matched, and I couldn't justify spending the extra money. However, to my surprise, when I received the 2130 today and actually read the owner's manual, it states the recommended FWD torque range is 25 to 350 ft.lbs. However, the corporate website shows the FWD torque range is 50 to 500 ft.lbs. So what's the real value? And why such a huge difference between the website information, and the actual owner's manual? I expected a little better consistency from IR's communication.$LABEL$0

This is NOT the same original Peanut Chew. I loved the "real" originals when I was a kid. These are barely similar to the ones I ate as a kid 25 years ago. These are soft and chewy, the ones I ate as a kid were hard as bricks and took their time melting the delicious flavors slowly into your mouth and the bits of peanuts showing up once in a while. I have no idea how they could call this "original"... not even close.$LABEL$0
very cheap build. The product is the second picture shown above. The build quality is the worst I've ever seen in any charger. I'm almost reluctant to use it since it feels so flimsy.

WTF?. Are you kidding me? This went from a pretty good storyline about moral values to some kind of bad X-Files science fiction movie; one that made no sense and left everything openended.

I Challenge Yes To Put Out A New Album As Great As This. I am so sick and tired of people criticizing Steve Howe's vocals!Sure, when this album first came out in 1975, it took me a little while to get used to the vocals. Steve Howe does have an unusual voice. And I was only sixteen at the time.But I have long since come to appreciate this album and Steve Howe's vocals on it. In fact, I think his voice is haunting. And the song writing on this album is brilliant.I would much rather hear Steve Howe sing the sophisticated music that appears on this album than hear Jon Anderson sing the primitive music that appears on recent Yes albums such as "Magnification".$LABEL$1

Looks nice, doesn't work. I like the stylish yet classic look of this watch. The face is easy to read, and the matte gold color is modern and attractive. However, the watch doesn't work very well. I don't know how, but the pin for setting the time comes out, and the watch stops keeping time. Since I really need the watch to keep good time at work, this is annoying.$LABEL$0
Wonderful Smell. I got a sample of this and loved it. I looked it up on Amazon and was surprised and a little suspicious of how cheap it was. Usually every perfume I like is expensive. I placed the order, and received the package very fast. The perfume was perfectly packaged new and sealed and I am so happy to report that it is exactly how the sample smelled. I'm so happy with it!! If you haven't smelled it you need to. I have around 30 perfumes and I guess I'm an addict, but it takes a very special perfume to make it into my few favorites. This is a new favorite.$LABEL$1

Not really that funny or entertaining.... I really expected this to be gutbustingly funny, but it's not. Given that "travel lessons learned too late," is included in the title, it is reasonable to assume that this is just misadventures, and it certainly is that. But the fact is, rather than coming across as something humourous, I just feel like Ayun Halliday is whining incessantly. This is partly due to the fact that she seems to get herself into trouble where just an ounce of common sense would have made things better...then again, that would have inevitably made this book nonexistent.That's not saying that there is nothing interesting or funny in this book. The monkey breaking into their residence in India was pretty funny, as was their misery in Romania. But other than that, I expected a lot more out of this. It just drags on, and on, with any bit of humour being sprinkled about like tiny grains of salt.$LABEL$0
good support. Bought this for my elderly dad, and it's quite supportive and soft on his bones. He usually can't sit on a regular wood chair without it hurting him, and this cushion solves all the problems, plus it makes the seat taller and therefore easier for him to get up$LABEL$1
Problems with network. Although SUSE 9.2 appears to be a well designed product with many useful features, I'm unable to get it to function as a DHCP client on my network, so I can't get onto the Internet or access any local network resources. There is perhaps some subtle tweak here that might get it to work but after spending an hour on the telephone with one of SUSE's support staff neither he nor I was able to find it.After reviewing some of the posts on various Linux forums, networking problems appear to be common with this release. Similar problems were not experienced by posters with 9.1. This is a pretty serious failing and I strongly recommend that you stay away from this product until these issues are resolved.$LABEL$0
NOT like 50 shades of Grey. I would not recommend this book. Not like 50 Shades of, Grey. Nothing appealing about constant crying and rape.

I forced my way halfway through the second book and gave up$LABEL$0

too short. This movie had a lot of potential, manga movies always have gr8 art, good storylines/plots, action..everything, however even though this movie was 83 mins long, it did not explain much and it leaves u with an unfullfilled desire 2 watch more. it is a gr8 movie, however it should have more 2 it (2 explain the character saya, and the other demons in the movie, and her involvement with the military). There could have been so much more put in2 this movie, but it was just a let down.$LABEL$0
A Yawn and a Shaking of the Head. This is one of the most bland and boring blues/rock CDs I have ever heard. There's nothing here that hasn't been done better by a hundred other bands. Power trio? You've got to be kidding! There are way too many holes in the music. I was playing music by Cream, Hendrix, and Mountain back in 1970. I know what a power trio is. I just don't understand the fascination with this CD or this band. Pass this one by.$LABEL$0
Such Pretense. Cinema doesn't deserve to be treated this amateurishly.

Castle!!!! Nathan Fillion Rocks!!. I have been a fan of Nathan Fillion since Two Guys and a Girl and I must say, this is one of his best roles! The dynamic between Castle, his mother and his daughter...just fantastic. Love the banter between Castle and Beckett! The other detectives and the Coroner are perfect too. Really, all great characters, great writing, WAY funny, Bravo!! I highly recommend this show to anyone looking for some humor and suspense all rolled into one. If you are a Fillion fan, you will not be disappointed!!$LABEL$1
Points, good price, work great, one problem.. the points, condensor, flywheel key, and spark plug are great! Gapped to .020 and it fired right up. I paid $15 for these parts separately at O'Reilly's. There are supposed to be two springs in this set, one sits on the condensor, and holds the wire running to the magneto in place (small black one). The other one, the silver one with a loop on each end pulls the point down when the crankshaft rotates to the correct position. I received 2 of the small black ones, and did not get a silver one. This isnt a big deal unless the points you are replacing have corroded springs.$LABEL$1
Awesome!. I think that Nick Carter has a great voice in the Backstreet Boys. But now he has brought his own flavor and talent to the music industry and i think it is awesome.

An excellent read. I am writing this review one week after completing the Barcelona marathon-thanks to The Non-Runner's marathon trainer. Before reading this book, the most I had ever run was 10 miles-I was not a regular runner.The training programme outlined in the book is credible and realistic, the authors also focus on the mental preparation-which I found to be just as important (if not more) as the physical training. I cannot recommend this book enough, if you want to run a marathon and don't know where to start-then this book is what you're looking for! After finishing my first marathon (I plan to do more now) I feel I can do almost anything, the experience was second to none!$LABEL$1

It's like reading spam mail. Literally, 95% of magazine is advertisement for dietary supplements (most of it is with Muscle Tech).Pages and pages of spam... sometimes of the same product from the same company will place these advertisements in the first couple of pages, then in the middle, and then at the end of the magazine.If you are looking for pictures of bodybuilders screaming like they are having a roid rage episode, this is prefect magazine for you.If you are looking for new weight lifting techniques to freshen up your workout routines, definitely look elsewhere.$LABEL$0
Good Handbook for Counselors and Pre-Engineers. This book is the cheering section for hish school physics teachers to encourage students to go into engineering.

I am a fan. I first bought this product on My Habit. I experienced an extreme outbreak on my face. My usual face cleansing regimen did not work. I was concerned because this does not lather.

Ah yes, The Blue Max. Who has'nt seen the classic movie starring George Peppard(a fellow Michigan boy)? So you've got to read the book too! However, it is much different than the movie. In the book Bruno Shtachel is an alcholic for one thing, and most of his problems stem from that. I had to look long and hard to find a copy of this book and when I did I was suprised to find how different it was from the movie. Actually I would say that the movie is better but I would still highly recommend the book. It was finally reprinted again in 1996 in limited quantities so is more easily available. All WW1 aviation fans must and probably do have this book. Thats why its so hard to find.$LABEL$1

This wasn't ready for late night commercial television in 1979. Not quite so sure they are ready for it in 2013. This piece stands as the epitaph for the macabre mind that was Michael O'Donoghue.

Amazing. 1.Bullets(A-)-Its deep, dark, and a song that lets it all out2.Freedom Fighter(B)-It's short and a typical rock song, goes along with Bullets though3.Who's Got My Back?(A+)-Easily the best song they've ever done, it's so deep in meaning.4.Signs(A-)-A lot like Bullets in how I like it, an overall solid song.5.One Last Breath(B)-I'll probably like this song a lot more later on. Like freedom fighter, its a typical rock song.6.My Sacrifice(A)7.Stand Here with Me(A-)-This song jumps right into it, it's catchy and a cool rock song.8.Weathered(A)-I love the song for some reason, the chorus is really good, and its a grade above the other typical rock songs.9.Hide(A+)-This song is fantastically done, from start to finish it's a unique rock song10.Don't Stop Dancing(A+)-Probably right below Who's Got My Back, but same type of song. Really solid beat and amazing melodyOh yea, Lullaby is a song correct? It's him and his guitar, puts his kid Jagger to sleep I guess. I don't count it as a song though.$LABEL$1

At least they spelled "God" correctly. This finale also kept me turning the pages right to the very end. The book ties up most of the threads of the story at the end in a deft convergence of a bunch of story lines. In fact, approaching the last pages, you begin to wonder how any of these can be resolved by the end. Most of them are, but, as pointed out by others, a couple of the story lines are left hanging. Although I've enjoyed the series greatly, one thing kept jarring me all the way through: Why does every human in the known universe speak in British idioms like "bloody"? This definitely makes this an "alternate universe" story; it's not "bloody likely" in our universe! The other quibble is that I have never seen a published volume with such a multitude of typographical errors. The proofreaders must have been on holiday during the production. English and grammar purists, prepare for many, jarring speed bumps as you race through this final installment.$LABEL$1

it reads like vanity fair.. this is by far the WORST kurt cobain book i have ever read. the entire thing reads like a tabloid, and anyone who didnt pick up on that fact obviously knows absolutely nothing about nirvana. dave thompson never met kurt cobain, so he didnt have any firsthand experience with the band. he portrays kurt as a total hero, and courtney love as a horrible talent-draining heroin addict. ive also noticed that the only people who seem to have enjoyed this book are the ones who have watched kurt and courtney, believed hank harrison, and proclaimed themselves nirvana experts. if you want a read nirvana book, get come as you are by michael azzerad.$LABEL$0

Best Computer Acessory. A year and a half ago, I purchased everything I needed for my first computer. I did a lot of research and went way wrong with highly recommended Dell computer. But, based on what I could see at the store (the clerks at CompUSA are not too eager to help) I bought this printer. It has been the best purchase of my computing experience. Photos are flawless, as is everything else I print with this printer. It seeems to do what it is supposed to and musch more incredibly well.$LABEL$1
Creative Zen Vision W. This is totally better than an iPod for viewing videos. Easy to use, great sound and awesome picture. I have loaded 3,000 songs and at least 10 rock concert videos with all the extras and still have over 8 Gb left.$LABEL$1
Excellent. I don't know why I love this collection. I don't care much for easy listening in general. However these albums struck me as containing gems. "Seasons in the Sun," "if You Go Away" (Terry Jacks), and "Love's Been Good to me" (Mark Lindsday) I knew from other artists. Rod's version do them justice, though the words may differ. Overall a great deal and a great collection! I only wish some of his Horizon material such as "Another Country" and "So Long Stay Well," and the "Good Times is all Done Now," were out. I only know of them through a Barry Mcguire import CD.$LABEL$1
I AGREE. I totally agree. I would love to know what in the world this thing is. I might possibly buy it! Amazon could get a whole 10 bucks from it. A word of advice for amazon; if you tell people what the hell something is the might BUY IT!!!!!$LABEL$0
Not a good resource. I have used quite a few "Intro to" books to learn various applications, and this one is at the bottom of the list. Granted, some of this may be due to the fact that I'm not overly enamored with QuarkXPress itself, but this book does it no favors. Information is not organized well,and the index isn't helpful.In short, the book doesn't do a good job of teaching Quark as a whole, AND if you are looking for help on a particular topic, its almost impossible to find. Now, to be fair I haven't read some of the other Quark books, so they may all have this problem, but I found this book to be below the standards of other training books I've used in the past.$LABEL$0

I thought this was a very good episode.. I enjoy watching all of the Waltons. This episode shows how war effects the children. The Waltons of course are always ready to help if possible. Ben got his two way radio to contact Germany. The orphans got to talk to their mom and they learned that their father was killed. It was very touching.$LABEL$1
Misleading label... really only 10mg of Lutein. This product has only 10 mg of ordinary lutein per pill. The 20 mg of "lutein esters" is not equivalent to the 20 mg pills you can get at Walmart or other places.However, the pills came on time and were good for vision, even at a lower dose than I expected.$LABEL$0
No zzzzzzzs in this Z. This movie, which is based on a true story, is a political thriller set in Greece. The chief of an opposition (left wing) political group is killed by hired thugs - with the police doing the hiring and controlling the massive cover up. A newspaper photographer begins unravelling the corruption and putting the pieces together. In reality, the scandal was so bad it brought Pampidou to power. It's a very fast-paced and taut drama. But the movie seems caught between presenting the factual record faithfully and creating a film mystery: we know what's going on while the movie keeps trying to keep us in the dark. Worth a watch, though.$LABEL$1
Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. Dr Northrup has given all women a gift of knowledge. This book is something EVERY young woman should read.

Echo Men's Wool Cap. This hat keeps you very warm, but their is no liner inside to protect you from the itchiness of the lambswool. Also there is no elasticity around the cap to keep it from flapping up and letting wind in when it blows. I no longer wear the hat.$LABEL$0
What more needs to be said?. 700 people, well 699 minus the troll, is loud enough. This series is great tv, and great sci fi. Unless you work at FOX where if its not reality, its not fit to broadcast. Imagine if one of the craptastic reality shows was given this same poor treatment of being shown out of order.Didnt notice if it was FOX that officially released this set, but if they did, and this show wasnt worth every penny, I would wish not a single copy would sell just to give FOX the finger. But what can you do? Its the best show you have never seen. So buy it.$LABEL$1
Excellent-Highly Recommend. An excellent book-Just what I was looking for. I'm a home educator seeking to understand how to train leaders-not followers. It challenged my thinking, inspired me for change, and pushed me "out of the nest" so to speak. (Or should I say, "off the conveyor belt!") This book is well written, easy to understand & direct in it's presentation.$LABEL$1
Essential Guide is good for its time. The Essential Guide is a very good guide to the characters of the Star Wars universe. Unfortunately, this book was written before the release of the new Star Wars prequels, so you won't find any info on those movies in this book. If you're an avid fan though, I highly recommend you buy this book anyway, since it has in-depth descriptions of key players in Episodes 4-6. Good buy!$LABEL$1
Needed accessory. If you have a extra battery as I do for my camcorder this is something you need to have in your bag. I can't believe Sony don't include it with the camcorders when you purchase it. Works great and saves time when you don't have time to stop recording to use your camcorder to charge a run down battery. Sony makes a great product but can't figure out how it they thought it would be a good idea to use the camcorder to charge your battery. Anyway worth the money and it don't take up a lot of room in your bag.$LABEL$1
Are you kidding!!!!????!!!!!??????. I bought this book because I expected to read some legitimate criticism of Darwinian theory. I find it absolutely hilarious that anyone thinks this challenges anything except for the notion that you can trust the reviews of books on this subject. "David Stove took no intellectual prisoners". Right. Just try to read the chapter on "Genetic Calvinism, or Demons and Dawkins" . "Stove's blistering attack on Richard Dawkins' 'selfish genes'and 'memes' is unparallelled and unrelenting." Oops - they forgot puerile and comical. Don't waste your money! I'm sorry I did.$LABEL$0
Chauncey Gardiner Reincarnated. They made a movie of this guy Tolle back in 1979 titled "Being There" with Peter Sellers. Tolle has done a miraculous "reincarnation" of the character, Chauncey Gardiner.$LABEL$0
How can anyone like these guys?. Sorry, but it is impossible to comprehend why anyone would like this music. Even the Amazon editor calls it "bile". The lead singer? Well... he doesn't sing. Period. That's the main problem with this band, the other being that the songwriting is horrible. There's good punk rock, like The Clash and The Ramones, but then there's this. On top of that, we can thank this cruddy band for inspiring hundreds of musically untalented snubs to try their hand at punk rock, ultimately killing rock n' roll and good rock in general. And these guys got inducted into the Hall of Fame? Pathetic! When the Sex Pistols never gave authority respect, why should authority give any to them?$LABEL$0
One of my favourite!. Aren't we all secretly hoping that there really is a match made in heaven out there somewhere just waiting for us? And that there are forces at work trying to get us together with the right person? Well, that's exactly what I believe, and I'm so glad Nora Ephron makes films that help our faith along, just like the books by Johanna Spyri ("Heidi") or Lucy M. Montgomery ("Anne of Green Gables"). Why don't we finally begin listening to the voices in our hearts instead of smothering them in all the turbulence the world offers us today?This film is refreshing, heart-warming and wonderful. I can recommend it to anyone that needs rejuvenation. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are both wonderful actors, and I have immensely enjoyed the films I have seen with them. This one is no exception. Applause also for Ross Malinger and Gaby Hoffmann for their roles as Jonah and Jessica. If you enjoy romantic comedies, this one shouldn't be missing from your collection.$LABEL$1
Propaganda and lies from the daughter of a traitor.. The first thing to look for when you want to read a book is the credibility of the author. And unfortunatly in this case the author has no credibility. Malika Oufkir had without a doubt been traumatised by her experience to a great extent. She portrays herself as a victim and tries to get the sympathy of the reader. I was born and raised in Morocco and familiar with the story of this family. The author omits to mention in her book who her father really was. General Oufkir tried to overthrow the head of the moroccan government but his attempt failed. ....$LABEL$0
Take the time to read it slowly. I loved this book; I found that Lysa could relate to the modern woman's life. She is one of us; struggling with the same daily challenges. Read it slowly - don't breeze through like we tend to breeze through everything else in our day.$LABEL$1
Horrible. These are some of the most disgusting tasting protien bars I've ever had. I was not even able to finish the first bite. They are bitter and leave a horrible taste in you mouth.

Pain in the neck. It's about 1 cm too short. You can just barely zip a U.S. passport inside, by stretching the fabric and bending the passport. Also, perspiration condensed inside the plastic window.

Disposable. The only reason why any Gorillaz fan would buy this CD is for the throwaway Hip Albatross and the harsh, violent version of Clint Eastwood rapped by Phi Life Cypher. The rest of the tracks were already available on various CD singles.

Great Product. We had our twins 12/20/04 and brought them home on a very cold day. Fortunately, I had received this product (times two!) at my baby shower. It keeps the babies warm, and the pouch can be folded in so their heads don't get chilly. Plus, we've received so many compliments on these covers! People always ask where we got them.$LABEL$1
5 star album; 3 star remaster. I was delighted when, finally, Nilsson Schmilsson was finally getting the "deluxe" release treatment. I'd paid big bucks for the import in the late 90s, and that was such a disappointment, sonically.Well, despite reviews to the contrary, the sonics on this release are not much better, and do not hold a candle to the original LP. My old LP may have a few pops, but it blows this CD release away, sonically. I don't know how that can be, but believe me, it's trueThis, along with Son Of Schmilsson, is a truly classic pop/rock album. Maybe someday they'll do it right. After all this time, I'll done holding my breath.$LABEL$1
" Includes Everything You Need" - what a crock!!. It clearly says right on the box "Includes Everything You Need". That would indicate to me (and most people) that besides the cake and possibly icing - everything you need is included in the box. This is incorrect. You are expected to purchase dowels and do drilling! in order for this cake to stand up. Very disapppointing! Wilton should be ashamed of itself. Maybe this is good for a professional cake decorator who already has these types of materials and has possibly done something like this, but for the rest of us - not good. The only thing this box includes are a bunch of crappy plastic castle pieces and some TERRIBLE instructions. Save your money and sanity and shell out the money and buy one at the food store.$LABEL$0
Very bad CD.. the music was amateurish, especially coming from name singers. I would think this CD is made up of studio throw away's.$LABEL$0
A pleasure!. As a dancer,I think this film may appeal mainly to those who are dancers/performers themselves, or those who have already seen Zumanity. Lots of backstage intrigue and enough scenes of the show itself to be titillating and encourage you to hop a plane to Vegas. Touching and often very funny as well- not an artistic triumph, but it more than held my interest. Wish they had more footage of Wassa and a little less of Miss Jonel's whip! The performers are absolutely spectacular and deserve full marks for their courage in doing what they do in Zumanity: present a vision of sexuality that is more...well,.. HUMAN, than the other banal, cliched and cartoonlike erotic shows in Vegas, or anywhere else for that matter. Spymonkey rules!!!$LABEL$1
Great value. I was surprised at what a high quality bit this is at such a good price, cut an exceptionally good, accurate plug at a bargain price.$LABEL$1
A terrible company. I would at all costs stay away from any product made by Phillips. I bought a dvd/vcr combo, it broke, I shipped it to them for repair, they charged me shipping and then sent back another broken unit. They then refused to take it back at their expense, even though they had shipped a broken unit (The first time the dvd didn't work, the unit they shipped to me had a defective vcr). Their customer service people have no authority to help you, and neither does their management. Repeated attempts to move up the ladder were ignored (i.e. being constantly told they weren't available, they never returned phone calls even after telling me they would, etc.). Beware of any Phillips product.$LABEL$0

The worst ever. This is the worst toilet paper I've ever bought. Packed loosely so it's soft, but so few tissues on the roll it uses up fast. It doesn't tear neatly, so there are bits left behind. And, it tears while wiping, nasty. Buy Seventh Generation instead.$LABEL$0
The Title Fits Them Perfectly!. Ice Cube went solo & had a successful career. Even though some of his songs were pretty harsh language wise, Cube always told a story, painted a picture of a young misinformed Blackman from the ghetto. Cube gave you the negative but balanced it with the positive. Cube's counterparts NWA completely fell into the bottomless pit of ignorance & couldn't recover. NWA's so called "street knowledge" in reality was "street nonsense." Without Cube writing the lyrics, NWA relies on ignorant word play & the most worst display of misogyny I have ever heard. There is nothing landmark about this cd, NOTHING! If I could have given this trash a zero I would. N4L fits these lames because only "N" would degrade their people as well as themselves this way.$LABEL$0
If you really like 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' chances are this disc will be a disappointment. Listen to sound samples before buying! Compared to 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' this CD was a big let down. Gone are the collages of movie audio samples placed over dark soundscapes (although a few short 'filler' tracks reflect this style). 'Hope & Sorrow' focuses more on guest vocalist and rappers and most of the tracks fail to impress. This seems to be an attempt at more of a commercial 'dance' release than the well crafted Turntablism record that I was expecting. I 'hoped' this disc would be an excellent follow up to 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' but all I felt was 'sorrow' upon my first listen. A disappointment.$LABEL$0
DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!. I bought this cooling pad and after 7 months it started making noise intermittently and then quit all together. When I contacted customer service, they said they would send a replacement. I paid to have mine shipped back and their replacement lasted a week.

Integral to Comprehending the why's of US-Cuban Relations!. As a student at the University of Connecticut I had the honor of being advised by Dr. Paterson and read this book as part of his History of American Foreign Relations course.

No longer supports Pocket PC's. If you want to upgrade and continue to use Money on your Pocket PC, don't bother. This new version does not support Pocket PC's.

Can't figure out why they've cut this off since they also write the software for Windows Mobile.$LABEL$0
Vocals Are Cheap. Richards writes pretty hooky rock music and uses the same sort of clichéd lyrics that brought the Stones greatness, but Mick Jagger, he ain't. To put it another way, he can't sing. Indeed, his vocals are so tentative and mixed so badly back that it's possible to believe there is no singer (maybe this was the engineer's intention). It seems clear that without Mick there would be no Keith, on the other hand, if one listens to Jagger's solo efforts one could equally convinced that the opposite is true. Doubtless they were wise to stick together; the sum is greater than the parts.$LABEL$0

wonderful autobiography. I'm a big fan of football, so of course i wanted to read, this book about Grambling's great coach. i'm a big fan of grambling except of course when they play Jackson state, or Alcorn. After reading the book, i found Eddie Robinson, to be a wonderful person who cared so much for his team, and his coaches. I felt bad for robinson when i read that a divison 1 school never even contacted him about a job, but what I liked best of all about this book, was he and his wife's Doris love for one another.$LABEL$1

poor quality. The very first time I used the lingerie bag for my delicates in the wash, the zipper broke. When I looked closer, I saw that the metal fastener on the right side of the bag was ripped and it caught one of my delicate items.

I am very disappointed that the lingerie bag did not protect my delicates and that it broke on its very first use.$LABEL$0
Great Performance and DVD!!!. Unlike the previous comments I thought the DVD was pretty close to perfect. I am not a musician nor am I an expert filmaker.

A decent Superman read. A very good and well written story, not spectacular or something hasn't been done before, but well worth the read.I'm not a great fan of the drawing style though, especially not the way Superman was drawn - he looks really fat, not muscly at all, and as a teenager, he looks way too old in comparison to Lana and Pete. I really liked the way Metropolis was drawn though - very much like Metropolis in Superman Animated Series.$LABEL$1

I inflated the tire to the maximum pressure specified on the tire, and I made it about 5 miles before the wire separated from the tire which allowed the tube to bubble thru the ripped tire, and then of course the tube exploded.I immediately removed the second tire and replaced them with WTB tires.These tires look like the typical junk that is manufactured to the bare minimum standards.$LABEL$0
It has many features but the GPS is worthless. If you want a GPS do not buy it. It takes a long time from the cold start to get signal. Several times it took about 30 minutes. The GPS is not precise, when I drove on the highway it was jumping around other streets. Two times it was off over a mile. You cannot see anything on the screen in a sun. I held two GPSs in the sun and I could see the Magellan's screen well, while I could not see anything on Plenio. I will return it for sure.$LABEL$0
My baby refuses it!. I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething.

I don't regret buying this album. I have had Clay's album for 2 1/2 months (since it first came out), and I have to say I don't get tired of listening to it. Some say this album doesn't have anything special on it, and that it doesn't show off the range of Clay's voice. I have to disagree with those who find fault with the album. Clay has a phenomenal voice, and I am sure that we will be hearing much more from him in the years to come.$LABEL$1
HOLLYWOOD PROPAGANDA, NOT FOR KIDS!!!!. Simply DO NOT buy this movie for your kid. There is swearing and so many adult themes I couldn't mention them all. Also, Hollywood has decided that THEY are going to raise your kids. They will say when and what your kids know about swearing, violence and sexuality. They force their values down your throat and you won't even know it until you have bought the movie. Don't buy this movie, avoid it at all costs.$LABEL$0
An enthusiastically recommended, thought-provoking cross-examination of modern society.. The Way of Ignorance and Other Essays is an anthology of writings by cultural critic Wendell Berry - one of Smithsonian magazine's 35 People Who Made a Difference - about topics ranging from what freedom is really being discussed when one speaks of "free market" or "free enterprise", to the costs of so-called rugged individualism in a democratic commonwealth, to sharp-laced observations on the Kerry campaign, and much more. Written in plain terms, The Way of Ignorance takes a cold, hard look at the doubletalk and doublethink that saturates modern American airwaves, stripping them down to bare conundrums, all with a heavy dose of the author's practical evaluation. An enthusiastically recommended, thought-provoking cross-examination of modern society.$LABEL$1

THESE ARE MY BOYS!!!. I have to be honest and say that Men Of Standards worst album (which was not that bad) was their first one, which was on a different label. I love these guys, because they can really sing, every last one of them can sing lead and that's pretty rare these days. They have had different producers, but they still produce a quality product. The only problem I had with this album is it's too dawg gone short. I recommend this album and all of the ones before it, even the first (so you can appreciate the evolution of these guys).$LABEL$1
Delivers What it Promises. Some may quibble over the left-brain, right-brain theory, but this is still that rarest of things-a book that actually delivers everything it promises. Experienced artists probably don't need it, but anyone who yearns to draw and thinks they can't will be amazed.I was 40 years old when my husband bought me this book and some drawing materials as a birthday gift. All those years, I'd been convinced I couldn't draw a thing. Using the instructions in this book and a beginner's class, I was thrilled to find myself producing some excellent drawings, including very realistic 3-dimensional portraits. Thank you, Betty Edwards, for one of the few books that really did change my life.$LABEL$1
I like this book more than others about this topic. One of the best things i like in this book is the soft and sweet way Katrina describe.

The grandaddy of all bloodline books. Hard to believe this book was first published over 25 years ago--it is still the granddaddy of all books in the Jesus bloodline genre.

Insightful view of Hitler's most fanatical troops. This book provides the reader insight into the men, organization and equipment of Hitler's fanatical SS who were undoubtedly not as fanatical as advertized.Plenty of pictures. Informative reading.$LABEL$1
Ryan's Return. I just finished reading Ryan's Return and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was interesting all of the way through and not totally predictable like so many books of this genre. I enjoyed the quirky characters and rooted for Kara and Ryan all through the story! Very good book.$LABEL$1
Raw talent gone stale!!. Where did Jonny's great talent go?? Where's it hiding?? Come back. The songs on this are boring love ballads and not what i was expecting. I am only 14, and if you can imagine a 14 year old hating this cd, how do you think older people feel about it?After listening to half the cd, I almost cried. I was so upset and disappointed that my favorite singer had let me down. Don't waist valuble bucks on this cd, wait for the next one. I'm sure after Jonny sees all the bad reviews, he'll learn his lesson and go back to the blues.WE'RE WAITING JONNY!! CAN'T WAIT!$LABEL$0
If you want modern-day Holmes, settle only for "Sherlock". I don't why we in the US do not want to watch the original shows! The BBC' "Sherlock", though only having 3 90-minute episodes per season is fantastically well written, and a true pleasure. After watching both seasons of it, I tried to feed my Sherlock need and moved on to "Elementary." I will not waste any more of my time.$LABEL$0
Disappointed by a long shot. I was quite unhappy to know that this wasn't a "Collection" of shows, but more of a "The making of" series. There were only a few episodes on it, and the rest of it was a disappointment by a long shot! If you are looking for watching actual Three Stooges, DON'T BUY THIS!$LABEL$0
Eagerly Awaiting the Sequel. This was the first book I have read by either Eric Flint or K.D. Wentworth and I must say that I was hooked from the beginning. The concept seemed fresh to be, man meets alien conquerors and fails to defeat them. This does not conform to the normal style of military sci-fi that I read. There isn't a whole lot of action, there is some and it is well written. The real catch of the book though is the characters. The Jao are an extremely well thought out race of aliens. They are different enough to not be human but similar enough that they are can be reasoned with to a degree. The aliens have their own culture/society that dosn't always mesh well with human culture/society. Aille, the storys main character, grows and learns from his time on Earth and the people that he associates with. I highly recommend this book to any sci-fi fan and I can't wait till the sequel is released.One more thing, the space battle in the sun's photosphere is super cool.$LABEL$1

I See A Deal....and Shame on Me.... I couldn't wait to get these shoes. I work with children and have to be able to run all over. I ordered two pairs, one in 6.5 (my true size) and one in a 7 (size I can wear in most athletic shoes). They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7. I've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have. Now, the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping. REDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again. I thought I could trust them because they were selling through Amazon...THINK AGAIN!!!!!!$LABEL$0

Average at Best. I ordered this radio based on the favorable reviews. Unfortunately, I am not very satisfied with the unit. AM reception as noted, is terrible, but even when you CAN get a station well, the sound is fuzzy and muffled. On FM, the stations are clear, but the sound is....OK. Not really the deal I was looking for, but the cabinet and radio are attractive.$LABEL$0
Not that good. I thought this phone would be better then my LG, I had. I love that it has a camera and video, but that is really the only good things about it. My phones freezes, drops calls, changes the audio on it's own, and now, it won't hang up when it's closed so my battery dies if I don't turn it off, so I have to turn it off when I am not using it, which means I miss calls. I am definitely looking into another phone right now.$LABEL$0
A must read!. Like most books of a commentary nature, Richard Manning spends most of these pages describing how agriculture changed the world, and not with the all too common culture hype. Did we live longer, enjoy life more and have free time as member of a hunting and gathering community? It seems so. Manning's thesis is that agriculture is and historically has been the recipe for most of the evils we now look elsewhere for the demons. The dinosaurs of the Industrial Age are everywhere, but firmly in control of agriculture, through massive government subsides. Processed "foods" made from corn, wheat, rice and sugar made from corn compose most of our American diets and make us FAT!There is however a deeper metaphysic in the book that should put it on everyone's reading list, and that is what really makes us human. "Against the Grain," gives us an insight into that history, not available elsewhere.$LABEL$1

Kid Rock-A disgrace to everything that's good about Rock. Please don't buy this cd! Spend your money on something that this garbage has ripped off.

Great Price, Poor Quality. I bought the Envision because of the price and what you get as far as specs.The first one I brought home would not power on. So I took it back and got a different one.The quality of the product is not that great. The plastic casing of the flat panel is just cheap. The cover on the back where you tuck in the cables has really small tabs that break off very easily, so be careful.I wish I would have spent a little extra and bought a Sony or Viewsonic$LABEL$0
I am using this as a picture book.. I showed this to my 1 and half year old daughter six months ago, and she still hasn't tired of it. The pictures are great and spark a lot of questions. I would recommend this to anyone who has a love of travel and other cultures.$LABEL$1
useful. We all need a good story. We need to people our exposition with the concrete. The listeners are o/k/ with saying, there was this man that... or I am told that ..., knowing that the preacher is using a storehouse of wisdom. Preaching is not about one's own special story, but about clearly and in an entertaining manner telling our shared experience and needs. This type of book is a must for all who preach or speak.$LABEL$1
Huge Disappointment. We planned an entire camping trip around the recommendations in this book and were sorely disappointed. "Yellowbottom" campground WAS paved, was cramped and there was no privacy whatsoever. We ended up in a Forest Service campground fifty miles away that was better by far. I don't know what the author considers spacious and private...but this campground was crowded, paved and lacked any of the reasons my wife and I go camping. We burned the book in our campfire.$LABEL$0

Awesome, quality is 100 times better. All right. Finally, after 17 years, we have a copy of KIMB that is listenable. Graet sound quality, the drums are tight, the guitars kill the ear drums, and the bass is fantastic. Good way to enter 2002 along with the new live album. Go Mustaine.$LABEL$1
Painful. The best thing about this book is the great cover art. The content...annoying, repetitive fluff. If you wanted to give your grandmother a nice book about a white supremacist who makes good; in a sugary way, sweet enough to rot her teeth out, this is the book for you. This is a very feminine book with the most masculine cover I've ever seen.$LABEL$0
A MUST for dryer owners. I'm not sure why dryers are engineered to be so difficult to remove lint build-up. However, with the help of this kit, I know I'm able to make sure my dryer is operating safely. I'm always amazed at how much lint is removed after just one month. I think this kit should come with all dryer purchases. It's definitely a necessity.$LABEL$1
Bad Acting. Ridiculously badly acted, especially by the lead actress playing the role of the mother. The movie amounts to nothing more than incompetent actors screaming and ranting.

Much better than HP!. This is my first Canon printer. Previously I owned several HP InkJet printers and one HP PhotoSmart printer. The Canon is leaps and bounds above HP. The main reason is that I have not had one single issue with it. It's smooth, quiet, prints beautifully. I like the separate ink tanks. I'm on here to buy a black replacement, which the printer kindly let me know was low. With HP, I always had issues with my PC not recognizing the printer and having to unconnect it, reconnect it, etc. I've owned this printer for about 6 months and am very pleased so far. It was a great deal at the $219.99 I paid. The copier and scanner work fantastically, too. The quality of the color copies is amazing -- especially considering how fast it copies and prints. It's so easy to be able to make a quick color copy of something rather than having to scan it in, then print it out. This printer is a great addition to any home office.$LABEL$1

Could be taller. I bought these because I have the two-step version and was hoping these would give some more height. They do but by inches. The washable cover is nice and I haven't had any issue with my dog mistaking them for a toy. My cat uses them the most, she's getting older and can't jump up on the bed as easily as she used to. Overall it's a great product but they could be taller. I currently have them set on top of a big shoe box to give it more lift.$LABEL$1

Worst game ever - not just among pirate games. This is literally the worst game that I have ever played of ANY genre. Comparing it to the original Pirates! by Sid Meier is very nearly an insult to that classic game. Simply put, this game has a terrible user interface, gameplay is difficult and BORING (gameplay refers to ship-to-ship combat, navigating through towns and swordfighting) and is incredibly BUGGY (as in constant crashing). Honestly, this is an insult for Bethesda to release to the gaming public in light of their other games (as in the Elder Scrolls series). Unfortunately, if a pirate game is what you are looking for, then this is about the only game out right now. I'd recommend, however, that you save your money and wait to get a game worth playing. Or at least a game thats FUN to play.$LABEL$0

If you pay for this nonsense you are funding the sickness behind it. I don't care if the book is amazing... it is being sold as the biography of a young boy. Not a fiction novel. The idea that this sick and perverted woman would create such an elaborate and twisted lie to play on the emotions and mentality of a nation is just pathetic and sick. I hope this woman does check the responses on Amazon, I hope she cringes every time she reads someone's response to her joke of a book. I haven't read it, won't read it, and would never put a penny into it. There is absolutely no excuse for this book ever being printed in the first place, and under the title non-fiction biography at that. Children suffer such horrors all over the world, and to make a mockery of that sickens me.$LABEL$0
Product Support is Essential!. I recently purchased Rosetta Stone Spanish from Amazon.com. I was initially delighted by the product and its approach to learning a new language. I then started having problems. I realized that an essential part to writing Spanish is the inverted question mark at the beginning of every question. I could not determine a way to make this symbol and I contacted Rosetta Stone Support via the internet and via telephone. I was amazed to learn that the normal level of support could not solve my problem and was told I would have to talk to a supervisory level. I was finally contacted by supervision 4 days later. In the meantime, I decided that this was not going to work and returned the product to Amazon.$LABEL$0

Thrilling!. When this book came out last year, it was acknowledged as one of the most awaited novels of the summer. I read an excerpt online and couldn't wait for it to come out.With such high expectations, the question to ask is..did it measure up?? I would say it did...for the most part. At times, I found the author was perhaps trying to create too eerie an atmosphere, to the point of being unnecessary.Otherwise, the story is amazing. The history behind Vlad the Impaler and the surrounding folklore and myths is absolutely captivating. The geographic locations Kostova takes the reader to are exotic and mystical;Romania ,Hungary and its political ties. These aspects of the book were expertly interwoven into the plotline, which was fast-paced and gripping. The characters got more interesting and provided more depth to the story as the book went on. A great read!$LABEL$1
Probably the Best and Most Current Book in the Field!. For my money, the best and certainly the most current book on the history of Chemical Warfare. Provides a lot of extraordinary detail on both the U.S. and Soviet Union's offensive Chemical Warfare programs. Easily readable with good, clear prose. Contains more detail than a casual reader might prefer, but for those with an interest, this book definitely satisfies. Deserves a place on the shelf of anyone that is engaged in this profession or with an active interest.$LABEL$1
"Oh god, mother, blood! blood!". The best sequel of all time. It's 23 years later and Norman is coming home. After 23 years in a mental institution Norman Bates is deemed rehabilitated. He goes home and begins working and leading a normal life. But his past continues to haunt him. Once he's in the house, familiar voices begin to be heard again. The sister of the 1st movie's shower victim wants to put Norman back into custody. So Lila, with the help of her daughter, begin to torment Norman. Murders begin to happen once more but are the murders the work of Norman? This movie contains all the shocks and turns that made the first so great. Alfred Hitchcock's gothic horror masterpiece was not shamed by this sequel at all. It made us realize what a good movie it really was.$LABEL$1
Most wonderful version of the life of Christ. This is the one movie version of the life, death and resurrection of Christ that I have truly loved watching. I would recommend watching Jesus of Nazareth by anyone who truly wishes to learn more of the story of His birth, life, and interaction with His disciples--and how He was so cruelly crucified, ultimately for all of mankind's sake--then, who wish to thrill at how death could not overpower and contain Him, because they believe Him to actually be Who He claimed to be--the Son of the Living God.$LABEL$1

Scrumptiously Illustrated Fantasy For All!. Having always been fascinated by those giants who roamed the planet eons ago, I had to have this one upon its initial publication. "Dinotopia's" tale of a land jointly inhabited by man and dinosaur is a truly captivating adventure.As fanciful as the premise is, the author logically develops the dinosaur characters based on the uniqueness of each respective species. Most are "good" and commune well with their fellow humans; but the T-Rex is still his usual grouchy self, much to the appreciation of us who were raised with the knowledge that the animal was one mean carnivore!By placing the setting in the 1800's, the book could have been written by Wells or Verne, which gives it the feel of a classic.And a classic, it is.$LABEL$1
Broke too easily. These sounded fine and were reasonably comfortable. But the connector to my computer broke after only a few months of use and was not fixable so it was money thrown out.$LABEL$0
Bad Idea. I can't believe that anyone would actually buy this. The average price for these DVD's is still around $12.00 each. It's not a deal at all. If they bring it down to $5.00 each ($150.00 total) maybe I'd consider buying it. Even if I wanted to buy it and the price was right, I already have some of these. Why would I want more than one copy of a movie?$LABEL$0
Very Good Introduction with great pictures. There are many books out there on the same topic, but Soldat features the best reconstruction photos going, plus provides a very good price into the bargain. Comprehensive, well laid out, with good colour photos in a separate section, SOLDAT is good for veteran and newcomer collectors alike. Highly recommended for collectors, re-enactors, costumers and historians.$LABEL$1

heavy wording. i like the idea of the book but it doesnt deliver what it says. it seems to be pretty liberal so far, and although it has high claims which sound nice, i am not impressed by the content of the book itself. at page 70 now. i find it difficult to read because the person uses difficult language and think it will not be easy for the majority of Muslim women to read, as delightful as the philosophy of self-knowledge and identity are within Islam, this book is a bust (so far). Very disappointing.$LABEL$0
Neat Stuff !!. Built-In Furniture is a great book for everyone who's ever dreamed of having a secret door to a hidden room or just wants to utilize seamingly wasted space.

Dramatically lower your blood pressure & cholesterol!. I eagerly read this book, since my partner has had lupus for over 20 years. As we adopted the vegan diet suggested in the book, my blood pressure has dropped from 140/80 while on 2 medications, down to 110/70 while on NO MEDICATIONS. I have also dropped 24 pounds since April (07). I thought that giving up coffee and sugar (especially chocolate) would be nearly impossible, but now I find that it has virtually no appeal for me. I'd much rather be feeling good!Ms. Harrington's recipes are quick & painless. She also suggests a wonderful, affordable health center in CA that gave us a "jump-start" on the vegan lifestyle. Thank God for this book. It has literally changed my life for the better!Donna PlaskiMilwaukee, WI$LABEL$1

Nice idea... poorly executed. Expensive with low quality.. I got this for my son for Christmas a few years back. At first, this seemed like a really cool toy. Its one of the few planetariums that actually project white stars instead of the inverse. Unfortunately, it was plagued by defects related to low quality. At first, a wire became disconnected from the planet projector light bulb. I soldered it back on and it worked. But ultimately what did it in was the failure of a position sensor on the main projector mechanism. The projector would keep turning and turning even after hitting the mechanical stop. I gave up and ended up throwing out this very expensive toy after only a month. My son was very disappointed. Save your money and look elsewhere.$LABEL$0

If the description doesn't sound like it's your cup of tea.. it's not.. This is a movie set in a fantasy world. You will see a group of young women in stylized fights scenes with Nazis, dragons and monsters set to cover versions of classic rock songs. If this sounds exciting, you will like this movie. If you're "not sure" when don't watch it. This movie has a very specific audience and many will "not get it." However those that "don't get it" shouldn't have bought it in the first place.This is a very twisted version of Alice in Wonderland, and if you want to go down this rabbit hole, you'll love the ride.$LABEL$1
Same as everything else these guys sell. From the number of historical inaccuracies in this amateur attempt at a karate documentary, it is obvious that the presenter knows absolutely nothing about the subject, and has made no attempt at serious research. He even makes errors with information he has "borrowed" from legitimate sources such as "The History of Karate - Goju Ryu" by Morio Higaonna and Classical Fighting Arts magazine because his knowledge of Goju Ryu in particular, and karate in general, is virtually non-existent.The "many little known facts" alluded to in the product description are "little known" because they are not "facts" but fiction. All in all, exactly what we have come to expect from this source.$LABEL$0

A perfect reason why people need to just shut up.. Berit Kjos is trying to push her personal beliefs and authority in this book. She fails to see that the true purpose of education is not to tell people what to think, but HOW to think. Berit Kjos is going the close-minded route and saying that we should tell our kids what to believe in instead of HOW to believe. It's very important for our kids to know HOW to think because that truly holds substance. Telling them WHAT to think , like how Berit Kjos outlines, means nothing. It's a terrible example of the closed-mindedness in our culture today.It's also poorly written as well. It's nothing more than an bunch of personal inferences. I would be inclinded to like this book more, were it not that its all based on one persons opinion. A really bad opinion at that.$LABEL$0

Much about Nothing. This is not a very good book. It goes around in circles and it is not an easy read. Half of the book is a waste.

Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus is SO much better.$LABEL$0
Don't waste your time or money. Don't bother wasting your time or money on this movie. I don't care about the quality of the cinematography, the quality of the story is what is lacking. From the elmination of Jack, one of the Robinson children, to the blatant disregard for absolutely any speck of information from the book, this film will make you cringe in horror. Rather, go get the original book, and curl up with your family and read. It's a better use of your time than watching this garbage. It doesn't deserve the one star I was forced to give it.$LABEL$0
Good Read. The book was highly recommended by two people whose "book opinions" I respect. Enjoyed the read. Really felt the "sisterhood". Brought back memories of my younger years.$LABEL$1
No Power. The book of Acts is a book of power! Sadly, this is what is lacking in the DVD presentation. The minute I began watching I knew it was going to be a weak (acting) rendition of the story. Thankfully, it is word for word from the Bible, which is why I gave it two stars. Reading through the book of Acts one can almost feel the electricity of the Holy Spirit working in and through the lives of the Apostles and believers. All of that is lost in the DVD presentation.I would not recommend this DVD. Stick to the Book instead.$LABEL$0
Ooo....I just can't get enough of his stuff! 1980 ME!. I totally dig this track, but it gets pretty tired if you listen to it all the time. I'm not crazy about the two remixes in this import (probably cuz I'm so fond of the original album versions). However, his DUET with Elisa Fiorillo in "Right Dead Back On It" rocks! We all felt that he should have included this in his album "Spin". Catchy lyrics and fun to dance to! And finally, the acoustic version of "Insatiable" almost brought me to tears. His voice is so compelling and I admire the influence of Kate Bush's "This Woman's Work" sung towards the beginning and end.I received this CD through an Aussie mate and I was excited to hear that he released "Crush" in Australia. I actually choreographed a dance number to "Crush (1980 Me)" and when the single came, I had my dancers sign it! If you ever experienced Pop culture in the 80's, you'll dig this song as well.$LABEL$1
Hmmmm. just to say I have a JPN PS2 + hard drive and you cant copy music or anything to it like an xbox can (i am fluent in Japanese so i know from the instructions). It may be different for this HDD but i don't think so. It dosent do much for other games though (you install FFX to it and it decreases the loading time by about 1 second, and you still need the DVD to play it). All in all, unless you are planning to play FFXI or other games with HDD support its not really worth it.$LABEL$1
Was good for about two weeks, then.... Top comments you see here are all correct - they let light in around the nose for sure, and the velcro strap is super uncomfortable behind your head. Also, if you leave some of the velcro strap exposed at either end it sticks to your pillow so you basically have to wear it at one length and completely loose the usefulness of the strap.Last bad thing: SEE THE SECOND PICTURE AT THE TOP WHERE THE BACK LINING CAME OFF. THAT HAPPENED TO MINE TOO, AFTER ONLY A FEW WEEKS. So dissapointing.Those bad things being said they are very light and nice otherwise. I never think they are that bad while I wear them as I fall asleep but my body hates them so much that I literally wake up every morning and I have tossed them on the ground next to the bed in my sleep.$LABEL$0

Great while it lasted. As with a previous user, the connection became loose very quickly (within 2 weeks) and does not provide a good connection between the power pack and cord to the computer.

Saw II. Saw 2 was a very good movie. If you enjoyed Saw then you will enjoy Saw 2. I thought that Saw 2 was better then the first one but the first one was still very good. I went to Saw 2 with a couple of friends one day and we all enjoyed it. Seeing it in theaters was awesome. It was a little bit loud. There is a heavy bass sound going on almost through the whole movie. I didn't get any sleep the night before going to Saw 2 from spending the night at a friends house and staying up all night. I thought I was going to end up falling asleep but I didn't because it was so good. I can't wait till this comes out on DVD I will definatly buy it the day it comes out! Very good movie. i recommend$LABEL$1
interesting but pretentious. There's interesting information here, about the role offshore tax havens play in our global economy; much of it is quite revealing, as we learn about the Cayman islands, and what corporations do in order to avoid paying taxes. The author gets pretentious, though (and nearly unreadable) when trying to put a philosophical spin on things... there is a long chapter on that which is simply indigestible, and the interpretations are so forced as to be laughable. If you can overlook that, though (just skip those parts) you'll get some interesting tidbits of information about the way corporations operate.$LABEL$0
Yeah, this isn't much good.. Conor Oberst's lyrics and songwriting just get worse and worse: while at least in the past he was able to write somewhat-interesting lyrics and come up with creative arrangements (such as the "Every Day and Every Night" EP), here he patronizes the remains of country music in a series of lachrymose, overwritten ballads that constantly strive after universal relevance, but just come off as self-righteous. The album's best moment is probably the single "Lua", but even that one's pretty lame. "We might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain"? Deep, man.Self-pity and self-absorption have rarely made for interesting art, and no musings about "What history gave modern man / A telephone to talk to strangers / Machine guns and a camera lens" will change that.$LABEL$0

"Tribute" Not One. I cannot in good conscience recommend this disk. I wasn't sure what to expect and am still at a loss after listening to it. It put me in mind of a bad lounge act in the Catskills ala "Saturday Night Live" and Bill Murray. (Is this what 'the Boys' have to look forward to?) If I could've given it less than one star I would have.$LABEL$0
Glitzy, but frustrating for younger kids. The program requires a lot of fine motor skills. It's too frustrating for my 3 yr old. For example, there is a coloring page ("color all the squares blue"). There are so many of the squares, and they're so tiny, that even I get a little frustrated trying to maneuver the mouse onto each one. In addition, the product is set up around a theme of "save the stars". Kids at the younger end of the age range, such as my daughter, would probably benefit more from a program that lets them "wander at will" a little more. (Try Disney Preschool.) Or, at least, a theme that's a little more laid back. (For example, Pooh Preschool, where the goal is to help everyone finish their work so they can make it to a party.) I also highly recommend JumpStart Preschool.My daughter is at the young end of the recommended age group, so maybe she will grow into it more. For 3 yr olds, I recommend staying away from this one.$LABEL$0
Is this a male fragrance, being sold as female?. Ordered this product based on reviews. Wow, I was definitely wrong to do that! The order and shipping was on point, however, the the product leaves a lot to be desired. It smells like irish spring soap. I could have gone to the local family dollar to get this smell. Never again.$LABEL$0
Respectable. Here's a book that read much longer than it really was. By the time I got to page 150, I felt like I had been reading it forever. But make no mistake, this author knows exactly how to pen a novel that I anticipate what the next page will read. With his picture perfect dialogue, Erick S Gray has obvious street credibility and is a master at displaying it in this twisted tale of drugs, prison, sex, violence, deception, murder, and mayhem along with the consequences brought on by the desire of money, power, and respect in the ruthless streets where there is often no escape. You can't help but want the best for Ricky and hope that the angel on his shoulders, Mr. Jenkins can save him from not only Kinko but himself.$LABEL$1
The Facinating Fusion of Kharma Zhu. Five stars for four amazing musicians! It's fitting how the first song on the album is entitled, "Music In My World." The worldly sound of Kharma Zhu incorporates rock and roll with flamenco, funk and blues. The music is upbeat, sensual, and even playful at times. "And Again" is another great song, using carefully crafted syncopation and Danny Marcus's falsetto to create a surprisingly sophisticated level of listening enjoyment. "Slave" takes the audience by storm with it's funky bass line and sing-a-long potential. This album brings you up and takes you down and makes you want to dance... A must have!$LABEL$1

Tempramental. We got this item from Walmart and I was not jazzed about it AT ALL. When we hooked it up to record, we could not get it to record one channel while we watched another. Then the tray stopped working after one week. I sent it to Samsung and they fixed it but it still didn't work right. When it was downstairs, I had to trick the tray to open and then trick it to close (HA! I could only do it... my husband could not). Then we moved it to the bedroom and miraculously, the tray started working.I've never been excited about Samsung products and this type of thing is why. We only kept this thing (for viewing not recording) because we already spent money on it and figured it would do until we were ready to switch over to blueray.$LABEL$0
Mystery solved. Next!. A sullen girl is imprisoned in France. A young nun in Brazil is tormented by mysterious abdominal pain. Father Joachim (Gerard Depardieu), the priest-surgeon assigned to the nun's case, is mystified by her ailment and fascinated when its cause cannot be determined. Perhaps he sees in the young woman's secretiveness a reflection of his own violent past? What is the connection between these cases and the mysterious words "screel deen" that the nun screams in her agonies?The filmmaker strings us along for the better part of an hour, as we tease out the mysterious connections. We are treated to mysterious voodoo rituals on the beach, a nosy journalist wannabe, an improbably love story and a mother with secrets of her own. There is so much deliberate confusion and unclear switched identities that by the end, I wasn't sure what happened and I cared even less.BTW: This film is rated R only for 1 shot of a nun binding her breasts during the opening credits.$LABEL$0
You need to read the manga.... The manga is alot better than the anime, and from these reviews on here people don't quite understand the story. This is basically an anime adaptation OF the manga...if you want the full story read the manga. Anime is never the full telling of the story.$LABEL$1

Saved My Dog's Life. I have a small 12 yr old death row pound rescue that started to fail so quickly that I was making plans for euthasia and cremation. I took the dog to the vet thinking she had diabetes but blood tests showed a borderline liver problem (elevated enzymes.) My vet was gone on Friday when I found out about this drug from my mother, whose dog was saved by this drug, but I couldn't get in touch with the vet.The vet wanted to wait another 6 weeks then retake her blood. I thought, she won't live that long at this rate.Since it is non RX I just went ahead and ordered it on a Friday night.By Monday it was here and I started her on it immediately. That was March 17. As of the 26th, she's 100% better, eating like a wolf, lots of energy AND buying from Amazon is half the price or less than the vet would charge. It costs about $21.47 a month.Thank you Amazon!!!$LABEL$1
ive seen military reports more interesting. i got this being interested in the combat history of the phantom and its abilities against soviet fighters,also in wishing to read about how it faired against them when they did not have crippling ROE working against them like in vietnam.I was very very board reading it as its hole text just one sleep inducing jumble of numbers.The decsriptions of the air fights is very brief and usually is SUCH AND SUCH GOT THEIR 3RD MIG KILL ETC ETC.The pictures are good and the plates are acceptable but thats not good enough if the bulk of the text is boring,hence the one star.$LABEL$0

My Favorite New CD!. First of all, I loved the movie. So, as I often do, I ran out to buy the soundtrack. The songs by Leanne Rimes are my favorites, but all the other songs are lots of fun to listen to. My only regrets are that they didn't include "I Will Survive" and "One Way or Another". Overall, I totally reccommend this CD.$LABEL$1
Go for cotton.... The fit of the boxers is great, as Calvin Klein usually does with all their underwear, but the fabric is terrible. When you use them for any sport activity you sweat twice as you would do with any other pair. Make yourself (and your skin) a favour and buy some CK Fine Rib Cotton ones. You'll thank for that.$LABEL$0
Not so great. As a mom of twins i thought this would be the perfect solution for the beginning. And i used this thing for way too long. It is IMPOSSIBLE to steer and you will find yourself straining and backing up a million times just to make a turn. Id say its pretty handy for 2 months max. But you might as well spend $50 more and buy a Graco Duoglider which accepts two carseats as well, steers great, and will last you because its also a real stroller!This double stroller frame is too expensive for what it is (or isnt).$LABEL$0

Terrible - save your time and money. Grisham's worst book by far (and I've enjoyed most of his stuff to date). A mediocre apology for the self-inflicted losers in society (drug abusers and prostitutes fare better than guy working 90 hours a week). Apparently, Grisham, having made plenty of money to date (which he earned), now feels sufficiently guilty about it that he wants the rest of us to help bring social "justice" about, so long as he gets to define the term. I could have lived through the social whining if there had been a story there, btu there wasn't much of one. An embarassment for Grisham and a complete waste of time.$LABEL$0
Not as good as it looks. This chair looks great. A friend of mine has one that is the same type of design but made from tubular aluminium and canvas that is so confortable that we fight over who gets to sit on it. I thought this chair would be a classy version with the same comfort so I bought 2. Boy was I wrong.The chair looks great but it is not comfortable at all. The end of the seat is too short or too long and your legs rest on the wood bar which is not at all comfortable. I'm not sure how it can be fixed (I think that the seating surface needs to be longer so that your weight rests on the seat and not the end bar) but it really is a design flaw.It also creaks very loudly when you sit on it.Definitely not worth the money as chairs but they do look nice on my deck! I now consider them purely ornamental.$LABEL$0

Not great for my daughter's hair type...or my nose type. My little girl is two. She has fine, but pretty wavy hair and it appears that it'll grown in very curly when she gets older (like her father). Though it hasn't grown in fully yet, I decided to hunt for a good detangler now to prevent nightmarish experiences with brushing hair later.Suave For Kids Awesome Apple Detangler does seem to make my daughter's hair easier to brush, but that's about it. Even the tiniest amount makes her normally shiny hair look dull and flat. The smell seems okay at first (like green apple flavored gum), but then has an after-scent of cheap hairspray that makes me feel a little sick if I smell it too long (can't imagine how gross it could be for her if she has my nose :) ). It may not impact everyone that way, but if you have a kid with fine hair and/or you or your child have a sensitive nose, keep looking.$LABEL$0
more features adds a frustration factor. I thoroughly researched cordless phones before buying Uniden and was surprised and happy that the replacement had many more features at a price substantially less than our five-year old Uniden: corded base as well as remote cordless handset; digital screens on base and remote for caller ID and speed dial/redial features and a plug for optional headset use, something that helps me a great deal. The negative: speed dial programming. The old Uniden model programming was intuitive, something that took about fifteen seconds. The new speed dial allows for entering a name with the speed dial number and a process that has my owner's manuel dog-eared from use. Press a wrong button and it's start over time. Yowch!$LABEL$1
Quit working after only 15 months. Do not buy this iron. It was fine for the first 15 months but today, it just quit working. No lights, no heat, no nothing! Of course, the warranty expired three months ago. Seems that this is a problem with this iron that others have also had. Irons I've had in the past worked at least five years before dying.$LABEL$0

The Runaway Jury. Out of all the John Grisham books I have read, The Runaway Jury was my favorite. It had an element of suspense that the others didn't, and I loved the plot. I thought it was very interesting to read about the "behind-the-scenes" of being on a jury, since all you usually hear is a verdict. The most interesting thing to me however, was reading about jury selections. I had no idea how much they research the candidates in high profile selections. Overall I thought it was a very entertaining book.$LABEL$1

Needs a DVD. The trainer works great. Gives my 12 year old grandson a lot of cuts that he was not getting before. I think it needs a DVD although to correct swing issues.

Stink, Stank, Stunk!. The author has been watching too much of the Blues Brothers movie where they go to Louisiana to compete in a band competition and meet the "Voodoo Queen". The conversations between the characters are choppy and unreadable. The story line in the hospital in ridiculous, with the hospital administrator being a drunk, the nurses being loony and the ONE police figure being unstrung. The ending is so comical, Blues Brother funny and unbelievable that you aren't surprised when she just ....STOPS the book with no plausible ending, leaving all characters, including the dog - just hanging. Please lady --- come back to the real world. If this is what the creole culture in New Orleans is really about it's a good thing they are rebuilding. Look elsewhere to spend $15.00.$LABEL$0
Great for electrical work. As an electrician, I have to cut out many rectangular holes for switches and receptacles. This tool is much easier and cleaner than the RotoZip I was using before.

Firewire option does not work. Any video recorded via the DVD-Direct firewire connection in Standalone mode does not work for me. I get unstable video when I playback the same on my DVD Player, laptop and PS2. Camcorders used were SONY DCR-TRV530 and Panasonic AG-DVC30P. Video fed thru DVD-Direct ( standalone ) S-video and composite inputs works fine on the same DVD+RW discs. Also works fine with the included NERO software. But the major advantage this model was supposed to have over others was the standalone firewire input. And that has failed for me.$LABEL$0

WHY? GOD, WHY?. First of all, Avril Lavigne is a corporate shill. She's a no talent poseur who doesn't write her own "songs," nay, she writes her own "lyrics." That's painfully obvious. There IS a difference. Why anyone would do a "Tribute" to Avril is beyond me. I could think of many more appropriate titles for this CD: "Avril Lite," "Avril Lavigne Karaoke," "We REALLY don't have any talent," "Now that's what I call really, really, really bad music."$LABEL$0
It works, but not everytime. Average instructions, easy to install, but it only works about 75% of the time. And this is with the transmitter and the receiver only about 12 feet apart, with no obstructions or walls separating them. And this is using the power from the original door bell, so the issue cannot be batteries.Not recommended.$LABEL$0
Not as great in person. I returned this watch because when I received it, I didn't think the quality was that great. It just felt cheap. Also, it's much smaller than I thought it would be. I have very small wrists, and the watch just didn't look right. The face and band should be much wider - it looks weird when wearing it. The watch looks great online, but it was disappointing when I actually received it.$LABEL$0

Zero star. It's not worth watching at all.. The acting is a bad joke but the special effect is good in some scenes.I think the movie depicts dark humor not horror but it's not funny at all. For example, in one scene, two ofthe best students of a professor killed his bride by cutting her into pieces. It's because they thoughtshe was just a robot created by him. While doing this, they kept telling each other how her body parts looked so real!I did not find that funny.There are much better horror movies which made me shudder.

The real deal on Pudd N' Head Wilson. I enjoyed reading Pudd N' Head Wilson. It was a little slow at times, but it made up for it, with all the mystery going on, within the novel. If you like educating yourself about slavery, and don't mind seeing the"real", I felt for the slave mother Roxy in the novel, I'm sad that she had to make that type of life changing decison for her, and her son. As well as Tom, and if it had been me,then I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing. I look foward to reading other books, but the infamous Mark Twain.$LABEL$1
The Academy got it right this time!. I loved this movie: saw it four times. But the screenplay is even more incredible, and it is blatantly obvious how talented these two writers and actors are. Seeing the movie enhances the screenplay, as ad-libbing is major and the hilarious stories are even funnier. Even without the movie, this is a fine piece of work and it deserves to be enjoyed by all who would hold it with as high esteem as it deserves. Enjoy and good luck Matt and Ben!$LABEL$1

What a disappointment. Well I am a fan of the book and I was really excited to see this so I went ahead and bought it. It got good reviews on rotten tomatoes and the cover just made it look good. Well, I was really disappointed. I tried so hard not to be critical, but it was BORING. They left all of the magic out of the movie. I could accept it not being very true to the book if only they had enhanced some of the scenes, but everything was just so bland. I should have rented it, and also the BBC version b/c that seems to be getting good ratings. The ending was in no way a good thing and I didn't feel any kind of true climax.$LABEL$0
Great Wire. This is the perfect size speaker wire to hook up your surround sound system. It's beefy enough to carry a great signal and still small enough to tuck between your carpet and baseboard.

Only reading it because I am past my delivery due date. Boooo-rinnnngg. Can you say Dean Koontz with an even bigger ego and smaller imagination? This was recommended to me highly. I wonder why. I am only reading it because I am waiting for labor to begin and have time on my hands. This is a path-of-least-resistance, lowest-common-denominator book with a mildly interesting premise. Flat characters, some are even charicatures, and the violence is so pervasive that one becomes immune to it very quickly. Like a Stallone film. High cheese factor, too. Maybe I'll pick up Pride and Prejudice again. Or read the side of a cereal box.$LABEL$0

Trekking to Everest Base Camp. As someone who has guided trekking and climbing expeditions in the Himalayas for 20 years, I would recommend the Khumbu Valley Blues DVD to anyone considering a visit to this region of Nepal.The DVD gives an excellent overview of trekking in the Khumbu, Gokyo, and Imja Valleys, and the animated 3-D maps illustrate the geography of the trekking routes quite effectively.Khumbu Valley Blues is not a high financed, professionally produced film, yet it's an entertaining program that provides a good feel for the Himalayan trekking experience.Mick BromleyB.C.

If you want to burn DVDs with your video, avoid this.. I have bought a lot of Sony products over the years so when I was in the market for a camcorder I foolishly just picked this up without researching it. After recording four tapes of my one year old I tried making a DVD and after 20-30 hours and using 3 programs, including Sony's Movieshaker (constant crashes) I have still been unsuccessful.

Bad directions, hard-to-find yarn. I agree with many of the other reviews written. I thought some of the patterns were cute and quick, but now that I've knit up 4 of the patterns, I'd have to say that they are just plain wrong! The baby's cardigan sweater and hat was a disaster. The kids rollneck sweater with fuzzy heart in the middle was not true to size at all. And others were just as bad. I checked my gauge beforehand and followed the instructions to the letter; the directions are simply incorrect. Sloppy work, Suss!$LABEL$0
Truly Dreadful Movie - Get the Original Instead. This remake of the 1939 film, The Women, is truly a terrible movie. If you must see it to compare, at least the fashions are fun. However, while the orginal is a great old movie, this remake has taken the plot and made is inexcusibly silly. Hated this movie. Watch the 1939 version called The Women instead. It's a well-done classic.$LABEL$0
All the wrong reasons. What a terrible Christmas book! Everyone is motivated by all the wrong reasons and no one changes. Everyone is hateful to the Kranks and they are hateful in return. They skip Christmas to save money. They then have Christmas to help their daughter catch a husband. People on their street decorate grimly--not out of a sense of celebration but rather one of duty. When Krank breaks step they don't throw off the shackles, but urge him to get back in step. One of his neighbors calls the cops on him. Charitable people doing good works are seen as con men. The Boy Scout leader gouges him when he has to buy a tree at the last minute. He and his wife seem to be engaged in a war. I feel like I've been ripped off. Thanks John! What a "nice" Christmas message!$LABEL$0
Works really good. I've had this headset for about almost a year and it works flawlessly. It is quite comfortable to wear with right size ear bud. Only complaint I have is it's bit too large.$LABEL$1
NOT Evyan. This is not White Shoulders and the name EVYAN is not on the box or container anywhere...not even the small print. This is by a imitation manufacturer and a deception!$LABEL$0
Not So Impressed. Our 4 year old daughter received this for Christmas and it was quickly returned. While the concept is great - kids love seeing themselved on TV - the execution on this product is less than impressive. After putting about $10 worth of batteries into the thing, the microphone didn't amplify very well. Our picture quality was about what you would expect for this price range. Overall, a good idea, but if you are looking for a good microphone, skip this one.$LABEL$0
thank god I checked it out of the library. It amazes me how being related to someone gives you full-fledged access to do things that normal folks would take years of living to acquire. I thought that I would get a really good book but boy was I wrong. My big question is "Where in the hell was Alice when her daughter needed her?" I guess she was writing those other whacked out books after Color Purple. This girl has issues that most of my biracial friends never had to deal with..ex: like a mother who was never there. I'm still trying to figure out how she can wax on for endless pages about "Color War" at a camp but we have a two paragraph mention that she is now in a relationship with a female. When did this occur?$LABEL$0
about EF! ?. Unfortunately this book is not really about EF! I was looking forward to learning about the operations and organization of EF! but instead was confronted by the authors own autobiography, largley about his work as a private detective. I wish the book had dealt only with EF! and extremists environmentalists instead of the author himself. I feel like the author missed an opportunity to provide an interesting account of his dealings with EF! Aside from obvious content flaws, the book was also written poorly making it a confusing and monotonous read. At the same time, I am glad I read this book because it seems to be the only one of its kind.$LABEL$0
Vapid Fragments and Horrid Rhymes. Morcheeba's latest is miserable at best. The lyrics are incipid and the sounds are tacky. Morcheeba has regressed from edgy triphop to bubbly pop inspired nonsense. This album reminds me of accidently leaving that terrible Vitamin C song on the radio too long. Don't waste your money,stick with Who Can You Trust.$LABEL$0
Husband loves it!. I bought the SkyScout for my husband for Chistmas with more than a little trepidation since customer ratings and comments seemed to be all over the place. I was concerned that he would not have the patience to go through what many of the previous reviewers had in order to get the thing up and running properly. It turns out there was no need for worry. After doing the online update, the Celestron has worked like a charm. Getting a GPS fix takes a few minutes, but after that it works amazingly well. He's been able to identify countless stars in the past two weeks and so far, he's totally thrilled with all that it can do. The SkyScout has been wonderful for finding a particular constellation and them identifying the individual stars within it. The informative audio information is not only educational, but surprisingly enjoyable since the recorded female voice isn't too robotic. I agree it's a somewhat costly item, but from my perspective, the WOW factor has been worth it.$LABEL$1
Great for little guys who like big sticks. My little boy is 2, and he loves to carry things around that are as big as he is. So naturally, he loves the golf clubs and he also likes playing with the ball dispenser. It's a cute kit and I think he'll have even more fun when he learns to putt.$LABEL$1

I refuse to buy any more Cd's of his. he has been a popular band up in this area, and the last few times he has been here his partying has been more important then the fans that sit and wait for him to get upon stage(I have been at two shows where he has shown up 1 1/2 hours late,some of his band members didn't even know what to think,and here we all find out he was out partying)So until he straightens up his act and quit acting like he's a superstar,this is one ex-fan who he won't be seeing a dime from and I have talked to others who feel the same way,and we all used to be die hard fans.:($LABEL$0
I liked this book. "FAthering the Nation" is dazzling in its range of subjects--Melville, Cooper, Douglass, Lincoln, political culture, architecture, political oratory--and the way it combines them. It offers sharp analytic tools for interpreting literature and culture in the antebellum period.$LABEL$1
Crusade: The Complete Series (DVD). I have had the VHS version since it first came out. But I no longer have a functioning VHS player. I would have preferred a BluRay version with 5.1 sound, but it looks like DVD with stereo is it for this now classic Sci-Fi spin off from Babylon 5.$LABEL$1
A New Johansen Reader. This was the second Johansen book that I read. I picked up Firestorm on CD to listen to during a long drive and instantly, I was hooked. The characters were memorable and the dynamic between them was incredible. I admit that this a little bit of a "chick" book (the fairy-tale ending is a perfect example of this) but I was holding my breath towards the end. Since then, I've read some of her others, but this is one of the best ones she's written. Bernadette Dunn did a great reading of it, which only helped me get really involved with the story. I hope that she writes another one with Kerry and Brad!$LABEL$1
Very Funny Book. I bought my mom this book for Christmas, and we both could not stop laughing at it. Definately get this book if you are a cat-lover.$LABEL$1
Another Excellent Book.... The author does a great job with this book, however, the characters don't tie in quite as closely as the other 6 books in her series do. I wish I had read "The Christy Miller Series: The College Years" first before reading this book because it includes a short portion about Seth Edwards. It would have helped in understanding a little more about him and his past. Overall it was a pretty good book once you get into it. The recipes are wonderful in the back of the book! Highly recommended if you love her books!$LABEL$1

the worst reprint possible. the colors are way off and quite ugly, they blur and the lines are quite thick, and lacking of detail. this is basically a reprint of a reprint of a reprint, the book that comes with is fine though. when compared to a friend's deck who got me into tarot, these just dont work at all and i dont get the same intuition as i do from his deck that he let me barrow, and his are over 13 years old, these look brand new but are as said before absent of the same vibrant color and detail. and that is important. just a bad experience for a first time buyer of tarot cards. i did want rider waite deck though, thats about the only thing they got right. could any one recommend the original to me with the same vivid colors and detail that i am seeking?$LABEL$0
One of my favorite Bruce Willis Movies. I love this movie. I don't know why. It tries very hard to be a serious, black noir ganster movie and it ends up taking itself too seriously. But I can't help it. The whole movie just entertains me. Excellent supporting characters are as one dimensional as cardboard, but they fit the bill. So what can I say, I recognize this isn't the best movie, but I love it.$LABEL$1
Weak Binding!. While the intellectual content of this book seems to be up to par, the book itself is very poorly made. Within a few occurrences of rather light use, the binding has already started to come apart!$LABEL$0
Beautiful Journey. This is a great example of what a good DJ is capable of. Takes you on a wonderful journey. Neil Lewis is a skilled artist and sensual master of the mix. Those of us who are lucky to catch him on the club scene know what I mean. Get this CD you won't be dissapointed.$LABEL$1
Fallout Boy- uhhhh another trendy crappy band. I have heard the entire cd and I couldn't even bare to listen to it again, its just that bad. It's one of those bands with a radio packaged emo punk wannabe sound. The song that they play on the radio "Sugar we're going down swinging" is one of the most terrible songs in the entire world and if I have to hear it one more time, it will be one time too many. If you are trying to listen to something of any value in the Punk/emo genre, please check out Through Being Cool or Stay What You Are by Saves The Day, which are great albums, although not for the people who enjoy garbage like Fallout boy. This album is a waste of your time and money...enough saidJS$LABEL$0
Over Priced. I totally agree with the reviewer who implied Acorn Media is short-changing the public, who consistently wait for the new Poirot DVDs episodes. This set is minus two episodes, already available in Britain.If you want all four episodes, "Mrs. McGinty's Dead", "Cat Among the Pigeons", "Third Girl" and "Appointment With Death" you can order it as "Agatha Christie's Poirot - Collection 7 [DVD] [2008]" from the Amazon.uk website. It is produced with a Region 2 DVD format; so you will need a DVD all-region player or one that has been adapted to play both Region-coded DVD's. You can probably get this cheaper too from overseas than Acorn Media, which has consistently been over-priced and always behind in putting out the episodes of this Poirot series and other mystery series.$LABEL$0

Great Idea But Does Not Work :(. The idea of a signal booster is a great idea, but you are lucky if it works. I read the reviews before buying and thought, hey maybe my phone would be different, maybe my service are would be different, but I am lucky if I get an extra bar and if you are in a building, home or basement, I do not get anything different than what I used to. It was cheap and at least I did not waste a lot of money, but still it would have been nice for it to work. Also installing it was a little fumbling jsut because of the way that it has to be stuck on. I would suggest to anyone buying this product to not, it just does not work.$LABEL$0
I loved it!. This was definatly worth the money, it has 3 great hits in Hard Knock Life, Can I get A....., and Money Ain't a Thing. You aren't going to get better songs on any other CD.$LABEL$1
Don't judge this book by its cover. . .. I am not new to spellcrafting, but I was feeling the need to give my practice a little boost. I headed to the bookstore and waited for a book to come to me. This one sort of dropped into my hands and didn't want to leave. I was sort of mortified by the Harry Potter references and put off by the cheesy cover art. But since I had "asked" for the right book to come to me, I took it home even though I would not have chosen it myself. Surprise! This is a great little handbook. It is simplified, but as someone already familiar with many magical techniques, I found the brevity refreshing. The techniques and perspective are solid and sound, but the BEST thing about this little book is that the spells can mostly be done using handy, everyday materials. Its a great little reference tool, compact but covering a wide range of magical subjects. Im glad I didn't judge this book by its cover.$LABEL$1
A mishandled "Voice". Yes, Mr Watson has the raw material for an attractive operatic tenor, but by the evidence of this CD the vocal material is still quite raw indeed. If he pushes, strains, and bullies his music in the manner heard in this album much longer "the voice" will be a mere shadow of itself in no time. Compounding the problem are the ill-considered re-arrangements of original material. The distending of Giordano's miniature marvel "Amor ti vieta" - to point out just one example from so many - shows how much the singer and his music manager misunderstand the music! Pass on this problematic CD and rush out and buy Naxos' superior Bjoerling album for a taste of a "real" voice.$LABEL$0
A must see Classic!. Imprisoned on infamous Devil's Island, Papillon ( Steve McQueen) is obessed with the idea of freedom. Together with his freind Dega (Dustin Hoffman), Papillon ceaselessly works on means of escape, his spirit refusing to be broken by savage and humiliating treatment from their captors. One of the few epic films which more than lives up to the promise of the great best seller on which it is based - aided by memorable performances of Hoffman and McQueen.$LABEL$1

Yep, Ground to a HALT!. Well, This grinder lasted for 4mo. and 5 days. I have to say that while it worked, it worked pretty well. It clogs up pretty quickly though. I kept it fairly clean but after the last clog it just quit working altogether. I gave it two stars. For durability I'd have given it one. It did work well originally though.$LABEL$0
Spend a little more and get quality instead. Purchased this to replace an old Panasonic Auto stop. Loved it initially, but with two kids sharpening pencils for school--not unreasonable, it lasted less than 6 months. The old Panasonic lasted 10 years. For the cost, I wish I has spent more and purchased something of better lasting quality.We sharpen 24 pencils each at the beginning of the year and colored pencils--sets of 12, then it's just as needed. This will last if rarely used.$LABEL$0

Didn't work. I purchased several cycles worth of this product after having read many of the glowing reviews about it, and also at the recommendation of a fellow TTC lady. I noticed no real changes. My CM was no better than it ever had been. I took the supplement as directed, so I don't see that there was any user error. It simply didn't work! I discontinued use of the product, since it's rather expensive, and I wanted to put that money towards some other form of TTC aid. I wouldn't recommend this product.$LABEL$0

LÉO THE LION. No,this is not DAVID BOWIE,who recorded a song of that title,but LÉO FERRÉ,one of FRANCE's enfant terrible de la chanson ,who had several faces over the years.This collection gives you a sample of his work.Four songs can be considered classics of his repertoire:PARIS CANAILLE,MONSIEUR WILLIAM,LE PONT MIRABEAU and PAUVRE RUTEBEUF.If there were a perfect song for him,it was MONSIEUR WILLIAM,the story of a middle age man who suddently is caught in a tragic love affair;LE PONT MIRABEAU is a famous poem by APOLLINAIRE set to music;PARIS CANAILLE makes good use of a sort of FRENCH slang(argot)and PAUVRE RUTEBEUF is a four hundred years old writing(i am not kidding).A good buy to get acquinted with LÉO FERRÉ.You can go deeper after that.$LABEL$1

What I Thought.... If you've never seen the broadway production, you very well may like this movie. I, however, have. I was highly disappointed with this movie.

Shag, The Movie. I knew it, I knew it!! When I bought the VHS format of Shag, I was disappointed because I was sure the music was different than the rental version I had seen. It wasn't nearly as good with the "new" music. I told the video retailer and they said I was wrong, that only one version was made. I read the reviews and I WAS RIGHT! One of the reviews says the DVD version restores the original music, so I am going to buy it. Can't wait to see the original version. This movie is one of the best feel good movies I've ever seen. Great for teens, adults...good memories. Like Pudge really needed that Metrical! It's the most fun!$LABEL$1
Dull. I have read many, many books about vampires, so perhaps I am jaded. This book was slow and dull. There is little plot excitement, little character depth and little originality. Parts of the book read well, but other sections read like the worst pulp fiction. It was a short book, so I was able to force myself through the whole thing, but I don't think I would have bothered if it were any longer. If you absolutely love this genre and have run out of everything else to read, you may find it just ok. If you are new to this type of book that start with almost anything else. I'm hard pressed to think of another vampire as hero/with romance book published in the last ten years that is worse.$LABEL$0

She doesn't like it. Our female cat had a favorite squeaky mouse toy covered with real fur. We were trying to find something with real fur, thinking that this was part of the attraction. It's more complicated than just being covered with fur. These Fur mice are hard--not compressible. I think that the cat likes something that her teeth will actually sink into, and that is not what this Fur Mouse is. This mouse looks fine to me, but for our cat it just isn't appealing.$LABEL$0

Warm Hands It Is. I bought this for my dad who works outside. In the winter it can get really cold where we live. He usually would put handwarmers in his pockets and have to fight with them all day.

Excellent Show!. I got seasons 1 & 2 on DVD on the basis that literally everyone I know loves Downton. I hadn't seen any of it yet. Started watching the first two episodes after work one night, and spent my entire day off watching as much as I could - so now I'm almost done already. COULDN'T STOP. Anyway this DVD set is alright, it looks nice and works well. However it seems that the first season is not HD while the second is. Also, not sure if this was due to the sound mixer on the original show or how the DVD version was set up, but the music gets really loud when there is no dialogue, haha. But I can't wait to see the rest : )$LABEL$1

Beautiful Colors!. I bought this scarf for myself and I love it! The colors are so beautiful and it goes well with many different outfits. The material is good quality and as a previous reviewer said it is 80% cashmere and 20% silk. In the picture it looks like there is orange in it, but in person it looks more like a rusty cranberry red. I guess it says that the colors may vary so this must be why. Anyway it's a beautiful scarf/shawl.$LABEL$1

Close, but no banana. (Miskatonic UCLA!). It has more Lovecraftian overtones than actual basis in one of HPL's stories and, in truth, these overtones, along with a pretty cool demon at the end, work best in the movie.It is kind of a hoot to see the University of California Los Angeles' own sunny quad pass for the miasmic, claustrophobic campus of Lovecraft's Miskataonic University, but even so this is pretty standard kids-trapped-in-haunted-house-fare.The sequel (with Maria Ford and Julie Strain as the demon) is considerably better.$LABEL$0
Only the first cd is any good.. What is this stuff for anyway? Sound torture?The first cd is ambient "space music" although it ends on a light industral note. CD 2 pick up on the industrial part but degenerates into torturous noises and screaming. CD 3, forget it. I had to listen to these in order to test them for skipping since the discs looked like they may skip.I felt like smashing my player getting through disc 3. Since my cd player is a 3 disc player, it was nearly heavenly when Clay Aiken's cd just happened to come on after that 3rd cd was over!!!!!!!!! Folks, if Megadeth came on it would have been a relief!It is also good that I did not listen to all three discs at once!!!!!Now for the price of a used copy, disc one is worth it for the ambient music. Maybe use the other two for Halloween parties or to torment someone for pi--ing you off.Speaking of torment, opening the packing is a torment.$LABEL$0

Sigh. this would have been a much, much, much better movie without the twist ending. A mother and father want to punish the serial killer who tortured and killed their son. Honestly, who wouldn't sympathize with that? So Mom and Dad kidnap the killer while he is being transported to a prison and lock him up in a empty cabin's basement and torture him.This is not easy for them, as they are not evil like the serial killer is, the mother especially has a hard time sometimes. Makes sense. Realistically done. Super.However, the twist ending blew everything out of the water. Now, there is not necessarily anything wrong with twist endings, as long as they are delivered and executed well and enhance the plot. In this case, it did NOT happen. It only ruined the movie and completely cheapened the story.$LABEL$0

Givin' It To Ya Straight. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The contributor really allowed Mason to express himself. This book was written the way I would imagine a conversation with him.

I am glad that I read this book, I always knew that there was something special about him. I see his love and dedication to God in his words.$LABEL$1

No selling out for Charlie.. You read reviews saying Charlie sold out with this release; I beg to differ. Mainstream radio wouldn't play this if their life depended on it! While he explores a couple of different avenues on two songs, this is far from selling out. You rarely hear the kind of rough and rumble, kick-ass style of country twang displayed here anymore. Some folks keep comparing this to his previous disc, and that's too bad for them, cause I can't see what the problem is here. Fickleness keeps some people from enjoying damn fine music. In this case, it's fine Texas music.$LABEL$1
Waste of money. Used the product 4 times, and on the fourth try the motor stopped working. Furthermore I wouldhave to run the grindings thru to get more juice. Makes more mess and is not worth the cost. Thestrainer is very difficult to clean although a wire brush helps. I bought for myselfas well as to give as a gift, and would be embarrassed to give as a gift it is so bad. The partwhere the juice goes in has to be held or it will slide away.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, NOT WORTH IT AT ANY PRICE.$LABEL$0

Music to mellow out to. I'm still a high school student, so I have loads of homework to do each night. The thing is, I really like to listen to music while I work, but most music really distracts me. That's why I love U2's ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND. I can listen to it and just mellow out and concentrate on what I need to. The melodies are soothing and relaxing, but they also have some nice, mesmorizing melodies. My favorite tracks are BEAUTIFUL DAY, STUCK IN A MOMENT YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF, ELEVATION, and WALK ON. I would recommend this CD to everybody. Just a note though, U2 isn't the kind of band that you really sing along to or anything, their songs are to be listened to and enjoyed, not vocalized by the listeners :-) Enjoy!$LABEL$1
The worst kids' video I've ever seen. This is the worst kids' video I've ever seen. Whatever you pay for it isn't worth it. The 30-minute video began with about 10 minutes of sales pitches (previews) of other videos made by Kid Vision (all equally excrable). When the "feature" started, an incredibly loud, phoney woman came on as host. She made my toes curl. When the primates finally showed up, one was wearing diapers, which gives you a clue to the educational value of this "Real Animals" video. In other places, the primates cavorted with the kiddies. How it ended, I don't know. I couldn't bear to watch the whole thing. I bought the video for my 5-year-old grandson, but I have too much respect for his intelligence to give it to him.$LABEL$0
It's a "companion" Not a Bible. I've had this book in my life for well over 10 years. When I first began studying Buddhism and the idea of Zen I was introduced to the Little Zen Companion. This book is a stepping stone. An introduction to bigger things. It's not a bible and it's not a guide to living. It's simply a tool to help beginners grasp certain concepts while at the same time reminding Masters that sometimes the mountain really is just a mountain.$LABEL$1
Blurry/Soft photos. No matter how I set up the camera, the pictures are just not very crisp. They are very "soft" and blurry. My Dad's 2 year old, 4MP Kodak takes WAY better pictures. I have a feeling that I may have gotten a bad camera and will try to return it for another one just to give it one more chance. Most people seem to love this camera, but there area few of us that are not getting very good clarity it he pictures.Other than that, I love the camera's size, features, feel, & ease of use.$LABEL$0
HOSTEL part 3(hopefully the end of the series). if there was ever a law in hollywood that should be enforced is labeling movies with a previous title. HOSTEL and HOSTEL part 2 are instant dark cult classics that brings the meaning of fear and asks oneself can this really happen?HOSTEL part 3(i have to call it that...) starts off like a ripoff of the hangover throws a BHC symbol and there you go!! The movie doesnt develop. The characters are weak, and the ending was so-so but it doesnt hit the point,If you a have a buck to spend at redbox and liked the other two. go ahead and rent it. its worth a buckIf Eli Roth doesnt do anything with the series, LEAVE IT ALONE!!!!$LABEL$0
Adrenaline Rush Action. Blade was a treat to watch. I took my girlfrind, who though we were going to "Ever After", and she loved it too. The begining 10 minutes and the last 15 are the best. After the movie I left the theatre ready to fight a few vampires myself.$LABEL$1
Ultimately Just Dull. This sounds like it could be really cool, in a David Lynch sort of way..., but strangely, after a couple of listens it becomes very irritating. The sound quality is pretty awful. Sometimes it comes across as exploitative (at least that's what I thought). This is one of those CD's you pull out when company comes over, but since it's nearly impossible to listen to an entire song you might want to save your money.$LABEL$0
Set your goals? Now all you need to do is achieve them....... If you've set all your goals, and need to figure out how to achieve them, this is the book for you. Full of sensible, practical advice and procedures for drafting (and sticking to) plans, it surpasses every other book on goal acheivement that I've read. It's not too hyper, if you like a book with a quiet 'tone of voice', but it's never-the-less inspirational with it. Buy it, read it, apply it.$LABEL$1
Wouldn't recommend for trimming the nether regions.... I didn't buy this for my beard, I bought this for shaving below the waist. True story.What I don't like about this is that it is a trimmer but is sized like a pair of clippers. Normally, trimmer blades are about half the size of clipper blades. The blades on this are way too wide to do intricate trimming, beard or otherwise.This just doesn't fit comfortably in my hands, it is just way too thick and I can't comfortably trim with it.They need to market this as actual hair clippers instead of a trimmer. It's just too thick and bulky to be a trimmer.$LABEL$0
Yet Another, Season 5 Disc 2 Victim - Disc Unreadable. I'm another victim of the poorly pressed disc #2. Anyone who buys this should check disc 2 to make sure it reads. They should do this a quickly as possible to make sure they can return their set, if they end up a victim. I highly recommend not buying this as a gift for anyone. No one is going to like getting a bad dvd set. Definitely not for Christmas!!!$LABEL$0
Ornish has the answer to better health. Like Dr. John Mcdougall, Dean Ornish proves that the diet, we as humans have eaten for millions of years in the key to good health. We have only eaten a high fat, high protien diet for the last 100 years. These food were limited to the wealthy and they paid the price with things like, breast, postate, colon cancers. These diseases are unknown in those cultures that follow all low fat, low protien, dairy free diet. He proves that most all cronic illnesses are related to the rich American Diet. A great book and a life savor for many.$LABEL$1

See "Saw". Sociopath movies usually aren't my bag but this film came recommended to me by a few unlikely sources so I checked it out. When the film started out it was suspenseful but the inevitable comparisons to "Seven" started to float through my mind. About the midway point the film kicked into second gear and delivered some twists that are superior to "Seven". Outside of an above average script for this genre type there is superb direction by James Wan. Wan really has a sense for establishing mood and paces his film well. About the only really qualm I have with the film is that the characters aren't really fully developed. For those who are a little squeamish, the film does contain some intense and grisly scenes but on the whole it doesn't go over the top.$LABEL$1
toothsome but enjoyable.... I agree with another reviewer. Miss Quick's newer romances are a bit longer wordwise. But the longer length is not needed and I hope she goes back to her older writing style. That said-With This Ring's was still filled with Quick's signature humor, quirkiness, intelligent characters and sensuality. It was also refreshing to have a 40 yr old hero and 30 yr old heroine. This book seems written more of a adventure than and "I adore you" romance but is still quite enjoyable. The love scenes are well written, especially the first love scene-against the wall, woohoo-is smoking!All in all-even a mediocre Quick book is better than most other romances out there:)4 stars-recommended:)$LABEL$1
Sucked - do not buy this book. Rating the author is senseless because the book (especially car books) never have enough pictures and detailed descriptions of the unique features of the selected car... however this book is a waste of a read. The author is way off base, his conclusions are nonsensical and he is ranting about something nobody cares about. I ordered it by accident, gave it to a friend as a present and he returned it... just my 2 cents$LABEL$0

Probably a waste of money.. Not so sure this is great stuff. I gave it to my 9 year old arthritic Leonberger, and it made her sleepy and VERY grouchy. She didn't even want to take it and I gave it to her anyway. Normally I give her a potato bread sandwich with Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM, Vitamin C, Turmeric and blackstrap molasses, which she loves and which quite obviously helps her feel lots better and quite perky. I only gave her this because I was running late and didn't have time to make her sandwich. I'll put it in the First Aid Kit, but we won't be using it every day.$LABEL$0
Not bad for the price. I installed this on my Rhino. It fit fairly well, however I can not zip the doors closed all the way. I also found the windshield hard to see through, so I roll it back up over the top (I installed snaps to hold it in place) It stays in place while towing.$LABEL$1
Good for the $$$. Hey, they're 50 bucks. What do you expect for that price? For this price, they provide decent sound, play loud enough for most environments, have good bass response, and decent highs. It's hard to criticize for the price. If you think you're an audiophile, you shouldn't be buying $50 speakers anyway. Break out some serious greenbacks and buy something that is designed for your "discriminating ear".$LABEL$1

Quaran...zzzzzzzzz. I rented this movie because i'm a huge horror fan...plus, i like Jennifer Carpenter...but to be honest, the movie just (literally) put me to sleep. That's all I have to say. I wouldn't write it off though...watch it for yourself, to each his own.$LABEL$0
epilator. Before buying this product I read all the reviews on Amazon and the theme was basically the same. It hurts like hell the first time you try it but it is worth every penny. The first time I used the epilator it took me about half an hour a leg. I almost gave up, however the second time was less painful and the third time was like normal. It's a similar thing with waxing, but in the end it really is worth the initial pain$LABEL$1
a fun crime caper set in south Florida - Miami Blues, part 2. Charles Willeford has definitely improved with age. His earlier works were a mixed bag. Competent, but no humour. However since the 1980s Willeford has developed a sense of humour which matches his ability to crank out good crime stories, complete with memorable characters. 'Sideswipe' carries on in this tradition.In 'Sideswipe' with have a violent ex-con, a disfigured ex-stripper, a retiree who just lost his wife, and a talentless artist caught up in some shenanigans. Solving the caper is Hoke Moseley, our quirky cop from the novel 'Miami Blues'. Actually most of 'Sideswipe' concentrates on Hoke and his odd family whereas the crime story itself is a relatively minor element to the book. But overall it works well. The overall effect is funny without being stupid.Bottom line: competent and fun.$LABEL$1
If you like bike stunts you'll love this!. I liked the fact that this isn't a studio production and totally homemade on a camcorder. It' all real and nothing is faked including a couple of crashes. I would definitely recommend it.$LABEL$1
IN STINK. n sync is just another baby band. They are such poseurs. One of the babies said he was going to pay Russia to go into space on one of their Soyuz rockets. Of course, it was just a publicity stunt. He was too scared and the Russian space agency is still waiting for him to say yes to the stupid stunt, which he won't, because he is a poseur like the other members of NSYNC.They do not play instruments, they do not write their own songs, the babies probably cannot even dress or feed themselves. They were spawned by the mega corporation "Disney", and they are one of the many contributing factors to the decline of this once great civilization.Baby Bands will fade in popularity like the leisure suit and the pet rock methinks.$LABEL$0

And people call this music. For all the people who are things like this is my new favorite song about "Everybody's Free," you need to check up on your definition of a song and also check p on your definition of music while you're at it. Even if you like the speech, uuhh excuse me song, how many times can you possibly listen to it? It's like listening to President Clinton's State of the Union adress with some really bad music in the background. This song and this album are a disgrace to the world of music. The only enjoyment I have gotten out of this song is when my local radio station took took the music and wrote a new, enjoyable speech that makes fun of everything Baz says.$LABEL$0
Entirely too hard to do, but definitely not the "no pain no gain" concept. Using this wheel is EXTREMELY HARD, especially if your are severely over weight.Its difficult to work your abs out with this product because it strains the hell out of your back!. The wheel is also very small, and it gives little to no support of your upper body weight, and its very hard to maneuver.I bought it, rolled it once, and threw it in the closet so it could just collect dust.Its just entirely too difficult and the only "gain" in this workout is some sore knees and some back pain. There are other products out there much more effective and easier to use.$LABEL$0
Mostly good, but breaks easily if dropped. I'm on my third one of these and will not being buying it again.The problem is with the design, specifically, that it breaks easily if dropped.The small loop attached to the main plastic bone is very fragile at the attachment point (which is very small) and, since it's part of the mold, cannot move. (it's like an "O" that attaches at the bottom, rather than an upside down "U" shape, as other brands have).It's also made of a more brittle hard plastic, rather than a more forgiving soft plastic, meaning that it tends to break rather than give under pressure.If you accidentally accidentally drop your leash with this thing attached (even a short distance from your hand to the ground), you'll probably cause the ring to snap off, rendering it useless.This happened to me twice already.Otherwise, it's not a bad product and works well, but until they address the issue with attachment ring design, I can't give it a full endorsement.$LABEL$0

The DVD does not play in my computer. I got a DVD of "The Importance of Being Earnest" for Christmas, but the DVD was defective and I could not watch the last part of the movie, so I exchanged it, hoping that the problem was with that particular DVD. The second one didn't even play at all in my computer. While this version of "The Importance of Being Earnest" is highly entertaining, I'm really frustrated with the poor quality of the medium.$LABEL$0
Not Worth It. This was the first clip art package I purchased, and I wish that I'd made a different choice. First of all, the images are not terribly high quality. The vector image can't be used in other program. The browser application is non-instinctive, and does not allow you to view thumbnails of images without actually changing disks every time you want to search a different category. There are a few images, photographs, mostly that are usable, but the majority of them look dated and ill-concieved.My recommendation is to check out Big Box of Art. A much better product at pretty much the same price.$LABEL$0

A huge improvement from Burnout Revenge. It takes a few tries to get used to the map and the Compass and all but it is so worth the time. This is one of those games that the more i play the more i want to play untill i cant see anymore! Dont be afraid of the change its like an album you have to listen to a few times to get it but then it lasts for a long time instead of getting it right away and getting sick of it a week later. This game is awesome to play online as well. I cant get enough.$LABEL$1
If you don't like it.....watch it again.. This movie grows on you. I thought it was just ok the first time, but upon further review I thought it was hilarious. Watch out for the gas station scene and the walk-off among others. Ben Stiller's facial expressions are classic and I find that Owen Wilson is always an excellent sidekick.$LABEL$1
Pre-order is canceled (Make a statement with your wallet). I was very excited about the release of Star Wars on blu-ray until George Lucas decided to get involved with the damn process. Once again he thinks making changes to the movies are for the better when in fact all he is doing is pissing off his fan base. You would think he would have learned the last time he made changes, but "NOOOOOOOOO". Pre-order canceled and I want nothing to do with this now. The once brilliant man has completely lost it. For anyone else who is upset about this, make a statement with your wallet. DON"T BUY.$LABEL$0
Andrea Yates Heads to the Country. This psychological drama has a paper thin plot, one dimensional script, and has been falsely advertised as a horror movie. The excellent cinematography and strong performance from the young lead actor cannot save this snooze fest.$LABEL$0
Resentment? More like revulsion. The title may see it all--Gary Indiana seems to resent everyone, especially if they're attractive or intelligent (like Dominick Dunne). He has no insight into the people he so recklessly attempts to portray (even minor characters that are easily identifiable), and he seems to think that he can aim poison at them without regard. The whole thing backfires--including his weird views about Southern California--and the reader ends up laughing at this silly concoction, not at the characters involved in a real tragic event.$LABEL$0

This model sucks. Don't buy.. My wife and I purchased two of these units for our daughters' families last year at Christmas (2003). Just as everyone else explained, they lasted about 6 months and the DVD player quit working.I don't know why the guy that posted a 5-star rating on this unit, and says to not complain about Philips or Magnavox, can make such a claim considering what all of us other "non-experienced electronics users" have to say about this unit (I'm a both a computer services program manager and video/dvd producer, and have never considered myself so unknowledgeable about electronics).Perhaps he bought from a different lot. It would be interesting to find out. Mine says "Manufactured:D August 2003". Maybe if others are from the same lot, we can contact our Attorney General and file something to cause a recall.$LABEL$0
A magazine article writ large. Unless you have more than one body type, this book will give you a mere three pages of advice for how to dress. I was pretty disappointed. My fashion advice: don't pay for a whole book when you get a magazine article amount of information.$LABEL$0
Strictly for newbies. There is very little information in this book that I found helpful even if I were a beginner. Lots of common sense. I found the format annoying ("dialog-based"). My recommendation - use the web for information. I returned the book. PS: There is no "easy" way to make money on Adsense... it takes a lot of work.$LABEL$0

Every parent in the U.S. needs to read this book!. I was anxious to receive this book since my own son has been diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease twice. Ms. Collins story about her grandson is a touching one. She does a nice job describing the impact this devestating disease can have on an entire family. She is obviously a very devoted and caring grandmother, and the story she paints of her grandson's life is moving and inspirational. She is the first of thousands of families in the United States to express the horrifying impact of this disease and I applaud her for her efforts. The information about the disease and the consequences of not receiving treatment contained in this book is something that should be readily available to every parent in the United States. Sadly enough, however, there are still millions who have never even heard of Kawasaki Disease.$LABEL$1
Never Even Got to Play it. I am a Sid Meier geek. I love Civ and all previous versions of it. I also play Pirates. I was so excited, as were previous reviewers, when I received this game, I ripped it open in anticipation. It installed fine, no glitches there. but I was never able to play it. I own a nice computer that exceeded the system requirements. I called "technical support", what a joke that was. After being disconnected 4 times, I finally got a human who told me to try a fix that had nothing to do with my problem. After 5 hours of applying that fix, the game still would not work. I am returning my copy and it breaks my heart.$LABEL$0

Do yourself a favor, Check it out first. I would strongly urge anyone to check this product out before buying it.... This is one of the first we bought. It is very slow. Our bright enough baby was unable to establish any relationship between mouse movement and what happens on screen. The characters talk to the baby and tell her or him what to do. Babies do not get it. Our baby is now a toddler and this softwere is still useless. I suggest Reader Rabbit Baby, Reader Rabbit Toddler, or Sesame Street Baby and ME. Stay away from Sasame Street Toddler. It is very old, probably a Windows 3.1 progrem that needs a lot of updating.$LABEL$0

dragged me in. I can't say enough about this book...and its successor The Glorious Cause. This book is what dragged in me to try to join DAR and learn all I could about the birth of our nation.Jeff tells this all in a voice that is not condescending but informs while entertaining. I feel these books are a must for any American History class or history buff. As a matter of fact I think all Americans, or those wanting to be should read these and understand the odds, the struggles, the remote chance that any rag-tag army could defeat the most formidable army on earth at the time!Exceedingly well written; I could not put it down and had to wait for The Glorious Cause!$LABEL$1
Not Recommended for the Serious Backpacker. I wouldn't recommend this book for the experienced backpacker or experienced dog owner. The author of the book writes regularly for Dog Fancy... fine publication I am sure, but neither myself nor my dog are particularly fancy. The information is overly broad (though I don't know what I expected for the price) and is not really applicable for anything other than the casual weekend trip or car-camp.If you are anything resembling a regular backcountry traveler who enjoys the companionship and security of your mongrel and are looking practical tips on how to keep your dog healthy, safe and happy on the trail, look at other publications.If you have a monthly subscription to Dog Fancy and a collection of brand new backpacking gear, this might just be the book for you.$LABEL$0
Superb!. 'Hitler: the Last Ten Days" is a very realistic portrayal of Adolf Hitler's days in the Berlin bunker. Alec Guinness plays history's most famous evil goofball very convincingly. The film presents verified events in a very engaging manner. It's an expensive movie, but if you have any interest in Adolf Hitler you will find it well worth the price. A film like this makes one appreciate how incredible it is that a weirdo like Hitler could have risen so high and done so much damage to humanity. To sum it up in three words-buy this movie!$LABEL$1
fantastic. The only fault I find in this series (Outlander)is the length of time between books. The last one came out in 2009, the next book in the series won't be out for another year. Four years is pretty awful. The series itself, (that means every book in it) is one of the best series I have ever read. Each book is almost impossible to put down. Having said that I wish I hadn't bought the first one till the whole series was published.$LABEL$1
Have I Heard This Song Before?. I like Alicia Keys, but I can always tell what artist she was listening to before she wrote/recorded this song. Even though I am young, I listen to music from the 50s, 60s and 70s. This song sounds a remake of an Aretha song with some Donny in it. In other words, this song is NOT original at all!! I do love the message of this song, but this sounds like a song I already heard before.$LABEL$0
Still An Enriching Experience. They may have cut the overture and intermission, etc., but what was restored in the directors cut lengthens the original. And I don't really feel the previously edited songs enhance the experience. Just like my dislike of "Apocalypse Now Redux." A poor addition of far inferior scenes in my opinion. Fortunately, "1776" still remains a patriotic and historical delight. Almost like watching a stage production, another example of how film adaptations done right, can add to the limitations of stage scenery. Should be required viewing for school children of all ages.$LABEL$1
Hello Garmin Customer Service?. I would NOT recommend this product. I bought a garmin nuvi 200, and it was great for the 1st year.

Their contact us page should read in bold "we do not care about your problems".$LABEL$0

Don't buy with the remote control included. This unit should come with a corded remote control attached. However many resellers don't have the remote and sell it without.You'll have a tough time controlling the unit without it. The buttons, especially the fast forward and reverse, are tough to handle and even worse the editing buttons are on the underside of the unit!I have one of these, without the remote, and learned the hard way that you really need it. NOw I'm scouring the net looking for a remplacement.$LABEL$1
Pretty but Not Sturdy. I bought this a year ago and have had it continually fall apart. It's very stylish and looks great, but the way the rack itself attaches to the wall mount is by one tiny little surface screw. The mount is secure in the wall, but the weight of the double towel rack bends the tiny screw its leaning on where it attaches to the wall-mount and falls down. I've even purchased larger surface screws that won't bend and that held it up for the past 6 months, but those are failing now too.Bottom line is that if you get a double rack (which is a worthy convenience) make sure to investigate how the rack attaches to the wall mount and that it is more than what you would use to attach a TP holder.Don't recommend this product, and subsequently the manufacturer.$LABEL$0
Sharp and effective, but the release is in a bad place. The release to retract the blade for safe storage is a great idea. But it it's right where your thumb grips the tool so you'll be cutting and CLICK - blade retracted. Other than that design flaw the concept is great and the tool works perfectly. I've saved so much time cutting material over scissors.$LABEL$1
Real Men Read Iron John. This book had been recommended to me for years. Finally, at the suggestion of my samuri sword teacher, I picked it up and read it in long sittings. What I like first and foremost about Iron John is that it combines memoir, translation, poetry, mythology and journalism all in one book and then delivers powerful messages about men's individuation from mother and journey into manhood. It not only provides a new vision of psychology and archetyping, but does so by dissecting the old, cross-culturally familiar "Wild Man." It helped me to better understand men's psychology and their initiation and rituals into manhood. It also provided me with thematic ideas to explore in my own fiction.$LABEL$1

An Early DWJ Title. From the previous review I think this was the book published in the UK as Wilkins Tooth. It's a fun story about two children who run a 'Revenge Service' to make some pocket money. As you would expect in a childrens book the scheme backfires. It reminds me of 'Ogre Downstairs' as it's set in an apparently normal town where extra ordinary events occur. I'm not sure why it's been out of print for so long; many of the issues surrounding some bullies in the story could be helpful to schools today.$LABEL$1
Dark Knight collapses. Terrible all around. Not engaging, not much of a spectacle, no messages or peculiar questions per se, the plot is beyond trivial. Compared to Dark Night I'd give it minus two stars. Compared to an ordinary comic-based movie it's 2 stars.$LABEL$0
Nothing special. I really don't understand all the hype about this movie. I am a personal fan of musicals, so its not the genre that bothered me. It is an entertainig and well executed movie, but not much beyond that. It sort of tricks you into thinking that its a good movie when really its quite flat. It has no message or theme, and you can't really come to care about the characters. 20 minutes after I had left the theater I had forgotten all about the movie, definitely a sign of a bad movie.$LABEL$0
WARNING! Not a Good Experience.. I purchased 5 thermocouples listed as "Honeywell #cq100a-1021 18" Thermocouple" and received 3 24" and 3 30" ALL of which had been previously opened, damaged, were missing parts, and poorly taped up. A couple even showed signs of use.....maybe the broken thermocouple returned to the store after a new one installed??? Either way I order 5 18" and didn't receive a SINGLE 18" and since the listing said NOTHING about used, damaged, opened, or parts missing products I rightfully assumed I was buying new product.The good news is they promptly refunded my money without any problems. Obviously they had had this problem before and were not surprised by my complaint. They did comment that they thought that is what I wanted..........NO, if I wanted 24" or 30" thermocouples that is what I would have ordered!! Overall a complete waste of my time and energy dealing with an incompetent and/or unethical seller. One star because ZERO is not an option.$LABEL$0
A really good and supriseingly hard science fiction novel. A great start to Michael Stackpole's Battletech novels, this one serves as an introduction to the whole Clan invasion, and is great for any fan of Battetech.Battletech itself seems odd, as few people would guess that giant robots blasting each other would be a good example of hard science fiction yet the novels are a a vocabulary building exercise in hard science fiction with just faster then light travel and the prime conceit that giant robots are the kings of the battlefield as places where it strays from very hard science fiction. Read it, it's good. It will teach you what magnetohydrodynamic means.$LABEL$1
Terrific utility stool. I don't have to be called from another room to get something from the top shelf of the cupboard. The stool does everything as advertised.

Delicious.. I wonder why I hesitated so long? I heard them first on a best of grass records sampler my aunt the DJ gave me in 98. I finally found where to get it almost a decade later.

Earlier Versions Definitely Better. While this is still a decent product, they have removed a number of the utilities that were offered in earlier versions. When I asked Norton about this, their response was "You can uninstall the new version and reinstall the old one," which is like saying, "Oh, well, guess you wasted your money when you upgraded!" Norton claims to have taken away some utilities because they weren't being used. Hey, I used them, and I bet a lot of others did, too. All in all, I was very disappointed in the "upgrade" I bought.$LABEL$0
Any one episode of JL is better. Here was an opportunity to put a little more time and effort into an animated feature as compared to the half hour episodes of Justice League (basically handled by the same team). It was an opportunity missed. The only "added value" you get from this direct to video movie is some mild cussing. I guess throwing in some foul language makes it more "interesting" or "edgey"? Anyway, to get to the point, any half hour episode of J.L. is better than this movie. And if you watch the ads you'll see a season set on sale for $19.99 at various retail stores. Pick up a season set of J.L. instead of this missed opportunity.$LABEL$0
This one's a WASTE- Is this even from Baby Einstein?. First let me say--my son LOVES the baby einstein videos--all of them--but this one. This doesn't come close--different format, weird animation and songs? it is totally random and doesn't have a good flow. It def. does not keep his attention (or mine). Save your money or buy Baby Neptune, MacDonald, Shakespear or any other one.$LABEL$0

Excellent CD. Fly is an excellent CD! Goodbye Earl may take a few listens to have it grow on you, but the other songs stick right away. Sin Wagon and Hole in My Head are two songs that get skipped, but the other songs are blared! Fly and Without You are the highlights! Highly recommended!$LABEL$1
Total paradox!. This book is very interesting, it tells the voyage of Varka, while he searches for his dead love, 'following' the tarot's major arcana cards. It's very simple and at the same time very complicated, in a manner that shows Louise Cooper's talent and originality. The word paradox will follow you throughout the book.$LABEL$1
Have muscles?. I bought this stroller so I could go for walks in the park and the stroller I purchased also had the feature "music on the move" which is the built in CD player. That feature was nice, but the stroller itself weighed a ton and putting it in my trunk was a task. This stroller is definitely for individuals with an SUV. Plus, the air pump they give you for the tires doesn't work at all. I was stuck going to my locate gas station to air up my tires. Honestly, I started off with the Graco Metrolite and I should have stuck with it. Anyone want to buy a HEAVY awkward stroller?(smile)$LABEL$0
Britney Bares Her...Soul. Poor Britney. No matter what she does, she's not going to get any respect from the critics. But In The Zone is as good as contemporary pop gets - it's fun, sexy, danceable and mature. Her voice is not a great instrument, but neither is Madonna's. What she is is expressive, sensual and energetic - she makes you feel what she wants you to feel. She had some great producers on this album, and it shows. It's probably a four star album, but I give Britney the extra star because I know she's going to take so many unfair shots from the haters. Which is too bad, because she's adorable and talented.$LABEL$1

programming reader. The book is terrific!!! The tutorials help me to learn the programming syntax, and users can try the case problems to apply what they learned. The case problems downloaded from the book website already contain basic code segment, so users don't have to type everything. Also, excellent references of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at end of book. As the title implied, the book is primary for learning HTML and DHTML. Reader that would like to learn JavaScript need to get another book, also recommed Beginning JavaScript from Wrox.$LABEL$1
Disappointment. If this is a "documentary", then every amateur U-tube video should also be called a "documentary". It is about that quality. All this amounts to is a few (very few) shots of some guys going down trails, almost no dialogue or explanation, and some heavy rock music - for 9 (nine) minutes!! The whole DVD is 9 minutes in length !! Almost no substance. So you spent over a dollar a minute, plus shipping, watching something of a quality you could have filmed yourself on almost any bike trail around.$LABEL$0

Big Long Book(that's a plus). Well, as any person would first notice about this book, it's HUGE! Or, at least it looked that way. I found the random use of French words irritating and i think that if a book is going to be translated they should at least translate it all of the way. I understand that the French is supposed to make an impression on me, but i like to know what i'm reading about. I love the plot. I love being able to constantly have to remember people who have not been mentioned in around 400 pages and have to test my brain to keep the plot straight. The other great thing is to be able to realize what's happening befor eit has been pointed out. READ THIS! pace yourself, and, if you don't like remembering too much at once, make a flow chart!$LABEL$1
Mine got ruined quickly. At first I was very excited about these headphones, mostly because of the comfortable fit and the retractable cord. I really couldn't tell the difference when I had the noise cancelling on, but then I thought, hey, this has a retractable cord, it's worth it. Well, I only have had these headphones for a couple of months, and now the cord is damaged and the sound is terrible, even though I have consciously took good care of these headphones. I think the cord got damaged through, oddly, the retraction system. Well, now I have to throw these away and get a new pair. I'm disappointed, for sure.$LABEL$0
Where's my magazine?. So I ordered this magazine along with Cosmo and Sport's Illustrated on November 29th. It is now Jan 28th and still not one issue. I would love to give this 5 stars since I think it will be a fantastic magazine, but I can't because I don't have it :-/$LABEL$0

Sound The Alarm for a Great New Musical Force. Sound the Alarm is a powerfully strong EP. The band formerly known as Sleepwell has put together a melodic blend of cool vocals and strong harmonies that mix tempos punctuated by heavy explosive guitars. Most of the songs start out slower and build to intensity with a crescendo of great guitar breaks blended with smooth powerful vocals.All the tracks on this disc are great. The production is clean and crisp.Although most people hate comparisons, I would say their sound is somewhat similar to bands like: Name Taken, Just Surrender, Race the Sun, Acceptance and at times reminds me of As Tall as Lions. Fans of those bands should definitely check this out. All killer and no filler on this promising debut under their new moniker.$LABEL$1
a great novel.. An orphaned boy goes to live with his relatives, and he slowly finds a new home. I enjoyed this book. The paperback with the cover of the porch scene is wonderful.I think the other reviewers were too harsh on this novel.

Revaluation of Values. I just have to ask: why is it that when a women has a torrid week of elicit aldulterous sex with another man she has found "the one true love of a lifetime," but if a man has a similar escapade, he is a shallow letcherous pig? The premise of this book is simply this: love is a blissful paradise which is at every turn impeded by such vile ecumbrances as committment, honesty, integrity and self-sacrifice. This book is the centerpeice of the vile "Oprah Syndrome" booklist. Intellectual depth is now merely a melange of "getting in touch with one's spirit," new-age psycho-babble and dizzy romantic love. To believe that such a book offers any intellectual substance is to assert with fervent honesty that one can survive a week's trek in the Sahara with only a glass of salt water and a stick of cotton candy.$LABEL$0
EVERYTHING is in this book!. 'A Bride's Book' is very complete and contains a page for just about anything a bride might want to remember about her wedding. There are pages for the wedding party, the guest list, the bridal shower, the rehearsal dinner, the reception, the cake baker, the DJ, the photographer, and that's not half of it! The book itself is a spiral bound hardcover, and it is very beautifully put together. My sisters and I gave one to our engaged sister for her bridal shower. If your bride likes to journal and scrapbook, this is the book to go with!$LABEL$1

SDRE continues to grow and amaze.... SDRE has managed to craft another masterful yet different album. This album is a logical extension of "How It Feels to Be Something On" but unique in its character and composition. The song-writing is top-notch. I have to say on my first listen I wasn't really that impressed - but I decided to give it another chance or two. Then it happened, a hook there, a beautiful melody over there and the spell was cast. The subtleties are just amazing! Combined with the craftmenship of the music - it's really a grand album.$LABEL$1

Hitler buffs might own it; the curious should visit library. This book is disorganized and the various topics, although related, are not cemented together with anything resembling a well-thought out, well-written structure. In what direct way, for instance, are Hitler's water colors related to the circumstances of his death? This book's most important information (who found Hitler's body, how Hitler died, where Hitler was buried, something I found of particular interest) should have been summarized in a two-page weekly news magazine article somewhere. Obviously, however, the authors felt that to read their exclusive but well-padded research should cost at least $20 or so, therefore, here it is, in book form. History buffs may want this book for the inserts and for what few pages actually contain fresh, well-presented information, but the curious who just want to know more about Hitler's last days should visit their library or borrow a copy from a friend-- who, I'm sure, won't mind lending it out.$LABEL$0

BIIG PIMPIN. OOOK, ive been waiting for this game to come out for a long time, thinkin yeah, secret of mana was awesome, so legend of mana is gonna be twice as good. WRONG. For one the game has no story line what so ever, and u really don't get involved in even your own character. Its just a bunch of pointless five minute adventures that lead to no where. You also have noo freedom of movement in the field world at all, its from one place to the next, no fighting. I'm sure all of your remember when your weapons get upgraded...well nope not in this game, which was one of my favorite options. Really i guess its the story line im disappointed in, i guess the first just won't be beat. I did have to give it two stars though because it gets kinda cool near the end when you get to do cool things with your "town". Overall id say that you'd be more satisfied with Superman64 or going to see Battlefield Earth.$LABEL$0
Good Investment. I am very happy with this baby sling. It's a little intimidating at first because of all the straps, and I had to have my husband help me adjust it to fit. But all the straps make for a very secure fit.My newborn is very comfortable in this sling. She gets to lay close to me. We tested this out by going to the mall. The whole time baby slept comfortably and not once did my back start hurting. I was very comfortable the entire time and both baby and I felt secure.For me the sling is less trouble than a stroller at this point and has been a nice option.I would recommend this sling. Just be sure to have someone help the first time adjusting it to your body.$LABEL$1

Shoulda paid more for something else.. I'm somewhat happy with this pressure cooker set. It takes a while to seal, and won't seal if it's not on high heat, so it's hard to make food you can burn, like rice. I think this is because it has safety features not found on old pressure cookers, but perhaps more expensive brands/models don't have this flaw. It's also hard to figure out how to use. The pressure valve label is confusing to some - the correct positioning is 180 opposite from what it appears. Only cooks at 8 psi and 12 psi, not 15 psi (250F), so it requires about 20% more cooking time (at 12 psi) than a 15 psi cooker. Didn't realize this when I bought it. For the $ I paid, it is OK. I wish I'd bought a better cooker; I'm pleased with the results.This is a copy of my review of theManttra Smart 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker. It seems the products are the same but for color, and I bought the silver one.$LABEL$0
This is a really bad movie; no refunds given at the door.. Curtis Hanson has made some very good movies(Bad Influence, LA Confidential, even Losin' It was cool), but this movie suffers from some kind of false scholastic irony and deadpan baby boomer humor that thinks can substitute for an entertaining story.Michael Douglas plays a loser. Tobey Maguire doesn't convince me that he is a genius underneath a loser exterior. And the absurd plot and weak relationships give the audience 120 minutes with no where to go.It is all a shame. This movie bombed for good reason.$LABEL$0
MDR-NC60 Doesn't Cancel Noise well. I had a pair of Maxell MAX190400 noise canceling headphones that broke. Instead of replacing them I thought I would try other noise canceling headphones. I bought (and returned) the following: Shure SE210, Sony MDR-NC60, and the Phillips headphones from Best Buy.The noise canceling on the Sony headphones is terrible. I work in an office that plays music that I don't like. I didn't expect total silence when wearing the Sony's, but the sound should be significantly decreased. However, I heard everything even though the NC feature was turned on. I just bought Maxell's HP/NCIV and they work much better and block out almost all noise. Don't waste your money and time with the Sony. If you really want noise cancellation get the Maxell.$LABEL$0
This book makes me feel stupid. I was so disspointed with this book considering i read and enoyied Dubliners and Portrait of a Artist as a Young Man and it is on alot of best books of all time list. The reason i liked Joyce's previous work is that both are not too long, he was a good writer and i am against the catholic church so any book that critizes it is okay with me. With his other books you really did not mind the parts when nothing really happens and his heavy prose style. But trying to read Ulysses is such a chore you end up scratching your head and having to read passages over and over again untill you get it. I gave up after after 300 pages and just went to [...] to read the study guide instead.$LABEL$0
World's shortest DVD. I expected this to be a 45 minute production or at least a 30 minute show. Instead it is like 5 minutes long. Can you call 5 minutes of flat video, shot locked down on sticks, a "documentary?" No awards pending here!I've never felt ripped off before because a DVD as to short! I certainly did when I played this - the world's shortest DVD production. The shots are fine for the duration of the 5 minutes, but there's nothing new here you couldn't find on the internet for free. Burn me once, shame on me! Perhaps it's time for someone to do a serious show on Cymatics. It is -- apparently -- an open market (no competition from this product).Cymatics is an incredibly important subject as it verifies the existence of the aether in a simple mechanical manner. This is topic in need of a serious documentary show. This is not it.$LABEL$0
A must have for any video collection. This is one of the best concert videos I have ever seen. The concert footage is fantastic and it also contains stories about the band and their travels. The guys from Matchbox 20 tell the stories themselves and they are a very humorous bunch of guys. It brought back memories of the concert I went to, including the feelings of excitment and exhiliration that I felt on the night. It truly made me feel like I was back there again. An un-forgetable experience. I have this video in my collection and I suggest you should have it in yours.$LABEL$1
Ehhh..... This is a well written and clever book, and the author is very talented. The thing is, I'm a little irritated and bored by the story of a 20-something, commitment phobic, seemingly adolescent kind of guy who is such an emotional midget that he can't even say "I love you." The protagonist reminds me of the quintessential young (immature) single guy whose self destructiveness is matched only by his narcissism...the kind of guy women (girls?) really go for until they get a little older and grow a backbone. Harry's a horrible jerk until she draws a line in the sand...then he realizes how much he cares and wants her back...have all of us not lived or heard this scenario in some way a zillion times since we began dating? Are we not tired of it yet? Maybe I'm getting old...it's just not very cute or alluring anymore...it was hard for me to sympathize and consequently hard for me to stop rolling my eyes.$LABEL$0
Magnets damaged my Treo. Quite happy with the case, which I use in my pocket (I have the case without the belt clip), so the weak magnets are not a problem.The magnets did damage my Treo (scratches). Sena responded to my email: maybe it happened because I take my Treo regularly out of the case?I thought this answer was not very useful, and their offer to replace the case neither, because my use of the product would not change, and the scratches were there already.Two stars because of quick reply to email and because I love the color (I have the brown case) - also cases do not come slimmer than this one.One more thing: I dropped my phone and since the top corners are not protected guess where the impact hit ...$LABEL$0
Awful. Being a big fan of prog-metal, and some prog-rock, I must say this was the stupidest excuse for music I have ever heard. If you like bands such as DT or even Spock's Beard, you'll be dissapointed. I have heard good things about this band, but they were obviously bias views. The entire album is eerie sound effects, that don't even come close to giving you that feeling of pure enjoyment. Music to me consists of a band utilizing their skills in song writing and playing their instruments, not making random creepy symphonic sounds with some lyrics. Only if you're interested in the traits in which I listed, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!$LABEL$0

Dr. Wilds' magic.. Chuck Wilds music is the flux that will put you in touch with your inner self. I have an amazing connection with his compositions. In the late 70's when I lived in Orange County my wife and I used to drive down the coast on Highway 1 (PCH). We had friends in Laguna so we would always stop and visit or have lunch. One of those friends was Wyland. Invariably at some point in the day we would end up on the beach, usually late in the day at dusk. We would sit and play guitars for a while and then just lay on the beach and meditate as the sun went down. I now live on the other side of the country but every time I want to recapture that feeling I put on Chucks "Laguna Indigo" and in an instant Im back there. Thanks Chuck. God bless you for your kind soul and the sharing of your wonderful music. Namaste. NklSk@t (SadhuDhaya) Nashville, Tn.$LABEL$1
Looks cool w/ iSight but is a huge disappointment. What you're paying for is the same thing as a cheap 40-watt desk lamp that can hardly light up a face in a dark room! Not only does the light hardly work, but the light casts you in a weird blue complexion, even in a well lit room. The ambient light sensor sounds like a good idea but doesn't really work that well (the light comes on even while in relatively well-lit rooms). Despite all of these shortcomings, the SightLight is very easy to install. Bottom line....Use an exsiting lamp or buy a cheap one on ebay.$LABEL$0

Great for carpet, not as great on hard surfaces or detail work. We've had our Sebo for 5-6 years and bought it for a fully carpeted house with very limited hardwood/tile. It was amazing, it is really an excellent vacuum with exceptional parts and performance on carpet. It does adjust to go on hardwood, but it doesn't really do a great job there, also, the standard attachements aren't designed to help you vacuum on any hard surface, just for occasional detail work (short reach, no hard floor attachment). Now that I'm living in a house with primarily hardwoods, I'm looking for a different player as it's not designed to be efficient in this environment.$LABEL$1

This book made me wet my pants - with laughter!. Are you looking for one of the craziest, out of whack books on any religious topic? Then you found the right book. Written by a former member trying to make his former faith look good, this author goes so far overboard one would have to be clinically insane to believe it - or to believe the religion found in it. I found my self crying at points I was laughing so hard at the insane ideas portrayed by this book. One has to admit, the author did a great job of creating a new religion. However, the one talked about in this book is more like Scientology (in that it is unbelievably insane) than "Mormonism."$LABEL$0

NEVER READ ANYTHING LIKE IT!. When I bought this book it was about six months before it became very popular. Acutually my dad bought it for me because he saw something about it on TV. Before I read the book I didn't think I was going to like it because it looked kind of thick. When I started reading it my mind changed immedeatly! I couldn't put it down! I loved how the author used big words I couldn't understand that led to big adventures that would get you so absorbed that you thought you were actually in thet book. I liked it so much that every time a sequal comes out I buy it immediatly. I highly recommend this book to anyone......even adults.$LABEL$1

Get the DVD instead. THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE AND POINTLESS CD.This is an expensive single disc CD. One side is music and the other side is enhanced so you can play the video on your computer. It is only 52 minutes long.This CD consists of the short songs from the complete concert that is featured on the DVD of the same name. This CD contains the lesser work from the concert. The only thing of interest on most of the songs, is that there is Randall Bramlett on saxophone.This show came just after guitartist Mike Howser died. George McConnell has just joined the band, but is so new, he is listed as a guest musician. He sounds out of place on most of the songs on this CD. He fits much better on the songs that were not included on the CD.Get the DVD instead. It has many great moments. The only real good song included on the CD is Rock.$LABEL$0

I know, Yeats--but listening once more to the Barry Lyndon soundtrack some 24 years after a first awestruck hearing has cast me back to my long-lamented lovestruck girlhood: what lost Celtic lass can listen to the Chieftan's version of WOMEN OF IRELAND without recalling Marissa Berensen reclining in her bath, and one's own shattered pilgrim soul. What a time it was to be caught up in Kubrick and Bach while my highschool mates played (what?) Mott the Hoople! I've hummed the song to my wee one every night for two years; finally I can play the lovely mix of passionate, rousing, and in turn melancholy tunes to him complete! The flute alone can break your heart. And oh the remembered passion of the line "But I cannot find the ribbon. . . ." What a movie! what an album! Listen to it and remember "how love fled, and hid his face amid a crowd of stars."$LABEL$1
Jumped the shark. Completely unbelievable.. Some of the "hacking" things that were done can, in fact, be done.However, not the way that was stated, and the reactions of people who do know computers (e.g. Angela) are horribly wrong.Also, almost everyone is acting out of character.Angela can't believe Pelant was able to edit a video to change the timestamp. She didn't say that it was edited too cleanly, but "how was it done?"The timestamp was inside of a black rectangle. That would be extremely easy for anyone with video editing software to change.I think I've given up on this show.Too lazy to continue this review.$LABEL$0
How about the solo albums on CD. With the Peter, Paul and Mary CD's selling between fourteen and nineteen dollars on Amazon, there is obviously a demand for their music. How about releasing the solo albums on CD?? If Warner's doesn't think there is a demand, make them two fers. Two albums on one CD. I would just love to have the "Mary" album on CD.$LABEL$1

NASB Black Leather Bible. I think this is a wonderful Bible and am enjoying it greatly. I was however, surprised to find that it is not a red-letter edition.

Maps and information missing. The Book includes a lot of hikes and nice spots on Maui but it was not a big help anyway. Some parts are written nicely, but this applies mostly to the car parts.The different hikes are not rated by difficulty and also no estimated time is given. Even worse is that maps of the hikes are missing so you lack orientation when you are on your way - I personally would even appreciate topographical maps - but not even knowing which trails I would cross or whether there were any alternative routs was very annoying. Furthermore description of the trail heads is unclear. Different hikes that are not alternative routes are described in the same chapter which makes reading confusing. All together I can not recommend this book, especially not as a full travel guide to Maui or as your only hiking guide there.$LABEL$0
Terrible pronunciation.

won't leave home without it. Just returned from a fab trip to Rome, and it was all the better for having Suzy's book with me. She was accurate about many of the stores (Francesco Rogani did lock the door while I was there), and having the addresses handy was helpful, as I don't speak Italian and sometimes have trouble reading the handwriting. From now on all I need to travel is one of Suzy's books, and a MapEasy's Guidemap!$LABEL$1
Packaging is Incredible. I bought this for my grandson. I had seen people on here slamming the packaging, but when he actually confronted it, it still surprised me. It seems to have been conceived ala PIL's "Metal Box"; deliberately designed to scratch discs or tear cardboard. I've never seen anything like it.$LABEL$0
Poor Results - Cannot Recommend. Sorry, but this product not only did not work, but it also killed the surrounding centipede grass and while the crabgrass is returning, the surrounding centipede is not. I used two bottles per the instructions and while the results showed within 2-3 days and it rained on the 3rd day, everything was killed. I was very disappointed in the results.There is no way that I can recommend such an expensive product that just doesn't work as advertised. Too bad, because there is a good market for this product.$LABEL$0
Look for something more sturdy.. This is one of those "you get what you pay for" items. (And I think I still overpaid). I would expect to find an item like this in the dollar store for about $1...in fact, if you look, there is probably one there. More than that, I don't think I would waste my money. It is very cheap plastic...like what plastic hangers are made of. This will not hold a lot of heavy belts...I'm sure it would not withstand any amount of weight. I was hoping it would hold more belts, but is not working for what I intended. I will keep looking for a much sturdier item as this one definitely will not fit the bill.$LABEL$0

Fantastic writing. I got this book after I won a contest. I initally thought after reading the title blurb that it would be a boring yarn about an autistic boy and did not read this for about 2 months. Later as I ran out of good books to read , I started reading it & I couldnt put it down. Personally I prefer thrillers and whodunits but this book really hooked me in. The character development is fantastic. The way the book goes on through the perspective of the boy is great. I also read the Rule Of Four which tries to kill time by writing loads of rubbish about the characters. The authors of "Rule Of Four" should read this book to understand what character development is.This book would make a fantastic movie too. Not a Hallmark channel one but an actual feature film.$LABEL$1

doesn't hold dinner plates well. I really like this dish rack for its attractiveness, and I like the way it is set up to hold cups all down the long side. The only problem with that is that the placement of the crossbar under the cup holders doesn't leave quite enough room for a large dinner plate. It's doable, but a bit precarious. Unfortunately, that makes it not very useable.$LABEL$0

The dullest yet.. When I read the last Jury book I promised myself I'd never buy another "hard cover" however in a weak moment I bought "The Old Wine Shades." This is, by far, the worse of the series. After this I doubt I'd even spend the money for a paperback. If I wanted to read about physics I'd go to an expert. Also, Jury and his friends are getting rather "long in the tooth"; older but not wiser. Another reviewer mentioned the ending - I never got that far.$LABEL$0

Seems like a good idea, but don't trust the pre-taped rolls.. I've used window shrink wrap products many times before, and when I saw the pre-taped roll, I thought it might save me some time. It doesn't.1) The tape on top doesn't stick as well as it should, and the double-sided tape for the rest of the window doesn't stick well either.2) The roll itself bunches in on itself, meaning that you have to cut the film much wider than you'd think to prevent creating little zig-zag cut-outs in the space you want to cover.3) The film doesn't seem to shrink as wrinkle-free as other products I've used.4) This one is a little but my fault, but I trusted the height a little too much. The pre-taped top is actually part of the height, which meant that the bottom came out too short on the first window I did. Re-doing the whole thing made me a bit grumpy.I wouldn't buy anything that comes in a roll again. I'll stick to the premeasured films that come in folded rectangles and do the taping myself.$LABEL$0
Great Techniques. I agree with the previous reviewer that the cardigan in the DVD is not to my taste but the DVD focuses very little on the design and knitting of the sweater. Instead, this DVD centers primarily around the techniques of cardigans including steeking, finishing edges, neck and front button bands, etc. If you have never steeked before or would like to see some expert tips demonstrated, this is an excellent reference!$LABEL$1
Big gloppy gloopy icky sticky mess. I read at a few different places that this would be good for papercraft, but it is definitely not. The glue brush/handle is just drenched in the goop and it's impossible to apply it with any precision. Definitely not for smaller type crafts. The applicator is just messy, no way to do it with any accuracy. Possibly only good for larger projects but I don't know.$LABEL$0
The only thing we have to fear.... I enjoyed this book immensely; both the story and the scientific lessons it attempts to inculcate. Unfortunately, the tale is all too believable.

How to apply for and obtain an Employer Sponsored Green. Most of the informations contained in this kit are also available in many immigration web sites.

Confused by Utterly Confused. I concur with Mr. K. Galligan's review above, I too spotted some of the same mistakes, moreover, on page 12 the author introduces the subject of Linking Verbs by using the term "predicate", although this is an introduction chapter and she has not yet defined what a predicate is, so for those who are unenlightened, or just learning grammar, they need to go to the index where they will find that the definition is on page 52, in chapter 4. I thought the approach illogical. One does not teach the basics by beginning with terms that have not yet been defined.The author begins the selection on verb tenses by explaining that there are six tenses in English, although another grammar book I consulted explains that there are in actuality twelve tenses altogether. The section on the distinction between "who" and "whom" was not particularly well explained either. For a grammar book that was supposed to help those who are utterly confused I found this book confusing.$LABEL$0

Very poor wireless range. The first unit I bought did not work. I returned it for another one. The second unit worked, but the range for wireless was less than 10FT.

samurai drama. Starts out as an average samurai drama but devolves into a pathetic Computer-generated imagery (CGI) battle fest that is too long and idiotic. 170 swordsmen can't beat 13 skimpy swordsmen.

Better out there. We have the wooden Melissa and Doug set. They are much better than these and cheaper. For example, look at the carrot. You can only cut it one time. In our wooden set the carrot is four or five pieces. Also, several of the peels and "throw away" parts of the vegetables are held on by tiny pieces of flimsy velcro. The husk of the corn and the leafy part of the cauliflower barely stay on after a few months of play. We originally thought that some of the peels and things might make this a neat set, but now it seems like those are the things that we don't like. This feels like a cheap plastic set.We own this set and the betterMelissa and Doug 31 Piece Cutting Food Box. If I were you I would go with the more durable and more fun to cut wood set.$LABEL$0
Just for your kids. It was incredible to see my 2 year-old son jumping and singing with the music of this television band.

Not what we expected. before we ordered the Oster 6058 toaster oven, it sounded like it had everything we wanted. Wrong. When standing at normal height and loking down to a counter top it is imposible to read what each button does. There isn't ever a light behind the buttons nor is the printing easy enough to see. In the window at the top there are red bars with something printer above them which I still have not been able to read because the printing is about 1/16 of an inch and not even clear. They don't tell you these things when you read about it. We like Oster products and always found them reliable. This one works fine, but it helps if you are 4 feet tall.Mel Bronston$LABEL$0

4 1/2 Stars-The People's Champ. Very good CD. I was very impressed by Paul Wall from the moment I heard him. I've never been a huge mark for the Houston music but Mike Jones I liked, Slim Thug's album i thought was garbage, and this Paul Wall I love. The beats are great, his lyrics are slick, and the overall presentation is very good, if you never saw this guy you wouldn't guess he was white. Paul is a big standout from the Houston crowd and now that he's on the mainstream I think he'll really break out because he's definitely something special. You wont be dissapointed picking this one up.$LABEL$1
For dog lovers everywhere it's a tug at the heart.. My daughter read this book first and passed it on to me, knowing that I would love it. And I did. Lou Dean writes in such a way that I felt that I was seeing the world in a way that was new yet familiar. Any one who has ever loved a dog will relate to her tale of growing up with a best friend whose tail always wags when you enter the room. A friend who loves you for yourself and for no other reason. I cried and hugged my own two dogs during the last chapter. Cuddle up in your favorite chair with your best canine friend and lose yourself for an afternoon. This is a short, well-written coming of age story that I recommend unconditionally.$LABEL$1
I love this guy!. I have several of Kendell Hogans workouts and I enjoy every one of them. I can even get my husband to do Kendell's workouts.

Awesome Shades. If you work outside, these are the shades for you. They are extremely light weight and comfortable to wear. The wrap-around shape provides good protection from flying debris.

Look elsewhere. This book was not good. It was conversationally written and thus easy to read, but if you are really paying attention and trying to learn something, you will notice inconsistencies and places where the chronology of events is not clear.For example: the Due Obedience Law is passed (exempting low-ranking soldiers from prosecution for dirty war crimes, as they were following orders). Next paragraph: "Despite government actions favorable to their interests, the officer corps remained unrepentant." Next paragraph - a group of soldiers protest. Next paragraph: "The Due Obedience Law followed." Huh?And that is just one example... one chapter was so jumbled I couldn't even follow it. If I could do it all over again, I'd choose one of the other histories of Argentina.$LABEL$0
Wordy, too little finance. Someone recommended this as a taut financial thriller. Well at over 500 pages it's NOT taut! I realize people reading financial thrillers envy their protagonists (the "wannabe" effect), but the portrayal of the protagonist here is annoyingly silly and shallow: keeps gloating about his Ivy education, berating everyone else, travelling the world etc etc etc.As a result the FEW chunks of financial and political plot (the dynamics of distressed debt default in syndicated loans, elasticity of oil with other markets, the details of algorithmic trading by what is known today as VWAP, TWAP etc.) are watered down with too much annoying, long winded, completely inconsequential tripe pertaining to the "high culture" of the protagonist. You get the idea. Bleah. The tripe to plot ratio in this book is over 60%. This book could be a "good" 200 page read. Instead we are treated to the author's diarrhea.$LABEL$0

The guy who gave this CD a 1-star rating was wrong. This CD sounds great, offering different versions of some of the songs we've come to know from previous albums. Townes remains alive and kickin', thanks to the loving production of Jeanene VZ. Thanks to her for her hard work and devotion, and to the sensitivity of the musicians she selected to work on the album. I think this version of "For The Sake of the Song" is the best yet. It made me really feel sad, all over again, that Townes has left us so soon.$LABEL$1
Ash Wednesday. As an Elijah Wood fan, I stupidly spent the money to buy the DVD "Ash Wednesday" thinking that if Elijah was in it, it would be worth spending the bucks to see more hours of 'that face' on my television screen. Boy, was I wrong! What an awful movie! And frankly Elijah didn't do well in it because he didn't fit in! Surrounded by dirty, bitter, foul-mouthed losers, he could not quite find his niche. Further more, the storyline is ridiculous. At times it seemed that dialogue was being invented...which actually would be an easy undertaking by depositing a particular four-lettered verb between each and every syllable. If you like Elijah as I do, skip this movie. Buy the much more superior "All I Want".$LABEL$0
1080i instead of 1080p. this film on blu ray was mastered in 1080i resolution instead of 1080p resolution INTENTIONALLY. it was done to compensate for the framerate of this film and had it been mastered in 1080p it wouldn't have been compatible with north american television's frame-rate capabilities! amazon, PLEASE BRING THIS ITEM BACK! the one star review is just to get this review noticed so more people speak up, and it in no way reflects my opinion of the title itself***EDIT 10/21/11***hey! someone listened! amazon brought the item back!$LABEL$0

This is a "Short Stories" review since there isn't one. After all that's been said above about this heroic album, "Olias," it would be silly to go on. Since I haven't found the first Jon & Vangelis album, "Short Stories," on Amazon, I thought I'd give it a go. At the time, knowing that Yes had disbanded yet again but in a way that signalled a true breakdown of the 70's musical vision, I was a desperate man. "Short Stories" should be made available by Amazon because it is the LAST Yes-vision album to be written. Vangelis rises to the occasion orchestrally and rythmically while Jon delivers the cleverest melodies. I only wrote this to tell you it's one of the last jems from the Yes-related folks at their best. That's all.$LABEL$1
Fun book for kids. We liked this book and my 23 month old (well she was 19 or 20 months old when we go the book)liked the colors and the interactive parts in the book.

This is not a classic!. The Philadelphia Story is pure garbage. People and critics have always raved about this movie so I decided to watch it and see for myself, to my utter disbelief this film is nonsense. The plot is childish and goes nowhere and the non-stop talking drove me insane 30 minutes in. Jeez Katharine Hepburn never shuts her big fat mouth, talk, talk, talk! James Stewart is pretty good but he didn't deserve the Oscar. This film is for whiny, spoiled upper-middle class nutcases! I hate it sorry but I can't pretend this is cinema art.$LABEL$0

Load of Crap. One of the worst books I've ever read. He wrote it hoping to get a movie -- just plot and action--NO character development. He's supposed to be a novelist.

We should demand more from our writers.$LABEL$0
poor quality, but "I got what I paid for". Knives in picure are not what was sent-very similar though. Pay a cheap price, get a cheap product. Locking mechanisms on knives are poor. I took the best/sturdiest knife sailing for 3days, despite the fact that the blade says "STAINLESS" the blade was rusty from the humidity alone. If in fact it is stainless, it has to be the lowest quality stainless in the world. No stainless knife should show rust from humidity over 3days. I would not buy again. I would have been better off spending the $$ on one higher quality knife.$LABEL$0
Nearly a waste of time!. This story is a very typical "makeover and get the guy" romance. The characters I could have really cared less about and the author spends more time talking about shopping sprees and interior decorating than she does on who these people really are.

There is no place like home and friends. All writing needs a beginning, middle, and an end.

Too Cute!. This cell phone holder is adorable. The only problem is that it doesn't allow you to attach it to anything; you have to have something to attach it TO.

I love it and have received a lot of compliments on it.$LABEL$1
i love them, but they're not durable for excersize. Well, I love these headphones, about 3 or 4 years ago I started buying them, because they don't allow any interference to enter your ear. I love the bass sound, and the overall loud sound they provide. The only complaint I have is that the cord is very frail, and because of this, these headphones cannot be used for running, or any other physical activities. I've purchased other similar koss headphones to see if they can be used for this, but they all seem to have the same issue.$LABEL$1

I'd like that shower now, please.... There's an amazing quote on the back cover of this book, something along the lines of, "Without obscenity, our cities are dreary places and life is bleak." And wholeheartedly agreeing - the Disneyfication of NYC 42nd Street to my mind rips the heart out of the city - I plunge in. What do I find? Nothing much that's terribly obscene, merely sorta sad and tawdry. The only thing that seperates it from a technically accomplished photodocumentation of a fratboy bachelor party is the mild millennial frisson the [gaijin] reader gets from the Tokyo floating-world setting. The Kenneth Starrs of the world (and there are lots, wouldn't you know) will find plenty to gasp at - "Look! She's got his penis in her mouth! Shocking!". But for the rest of us, Araki-san and his many imitators will have to do better if they truly want to save us from our sterilized, sanitized, thoroughly G-rated future.$LABEL$0
Works perfectly!. I get a few video dropouts from importing video to my laptop from my MiniDV camcorder. But since this is the only time that I've ever had to deal with firewire, I rated it 5 stars because the video looks amazing! So I don't know if the dropouts are due to my hardware/software or this cord. Either way, the dropouts are negligible for personal video production so I highly recommend this.$LABEL$1

Cold Creek Manor DVD. I never was able to watch this movie. It was made for some other "region" so would not play on any USA device.

Great introduction to Queen, this tape changed my life.. After hearing Bohemian Rhapsody on the radio some time ago, I stormed into my parents cd collection and pulled out Classic Queen to listen to that marvelous Freddie Mercury hit. Soon I began to listen to the other tracks on the album and instantly fell in love with the band's unique sound. Right then I knew I had to see this band in action. When I popped in the tape right from its fabulous plastic wrapped box I sat for 80 minutes straight in awe. This provoked me to start a band, even though I only played the didgerido. Soon enough I had joined a real band, bought a cheap Johnson bass, and practiced incessantly. Now I sit back and jam with my band on my Fender fretless sunburst jazz bass pondering where I would be without that splendid video.$LABEL$1
Hollywood Hogwash. The thrilling action sequences do not make up for the complete lack of historical accuracy, and anti-British tirade. Will American audiences swallow anything? The portrayal of a peace loving, patriotic, slave-freeing Hollywood hero is enough to make Ghandi vomit. Not that Mel Gibson is a bad actor, or the directing is poor, it's just that the message is absolute garbage.I'm a student from England, and am particularly interested in the British Empire and the colonies in the Americas. But this portrayal of valiant and innocent rebels standing up to evil, Nazi-like redcoats is laughable. British soldiers burning people alive in a church? On what grounds do they base that? The American rebels were early terrorists, not freedom fighters. Half of Americans liked British rule and King George, bless them!See the film if you must, it's quite enjoyable, but dig out your history books later and learn a few home truths about the American revolution.

Lots of fuss over very little. I really just don't get the fuss. So far this year this is the most mediocre book I've bothered finishing. And the only reason I finished is because a friend recommended it. I ended up skimming huge chunks just to get through it.The plotting was transparent. With perhaps two exceptions I could pretty much tell what was going to happen. Boring.The characterization was nonexistent. The heroine had no personality, the hero was perfect and had no personality, the secondary characters were archetypes. Boring.The world building was thrown at you in undigestible chunks at the beginning. A good author weaves the world seamlessly into the plot, IMO.And how hokey - she gets a normal face and doesn't know if she's ugly or pretty <eye roll>. And worst of all, this book ends in the middle of nowhere. It. Just. Ends. ARGH!!If I hadn't gotten this book from the library and had actually paid full cover price for it I would be frothing at the mouth.$LABEL$0
great while it lasted.... This coffee grinder made great coffee...for a while. After two years, it started acting up and now does not work at all. Quite a shock the day I went to make my coffee and couldn't! Ended up using my food processor for my beans that day...yech.$LABEL$0
Love it!. My grandsons love Bibleman. I have bought 5 of the videos so far (and the costumes, at their request). This is my all time favorite so far. The villain, Shadow of Doubt, is a scream. He plays it just right and his dance number with the two dark sisters is hilarious and inspired. Everything just works in this video, a real treat to watch and has some good lessons.$LABEL$1
A must for children of all ages. This was excellent!!! Tina Arena was very beautiful. Glenn Close was wonderful too. Micheal Ball has always been my favorite broadway singer. He was wonderful in Les Miserables, and he can do no wrong! Sarah Brightman was terrific, and Micheal Crawford was missed. Lottie Mayor is so wonderul,she is my new favorite. Everyone should leave Antonio Banderas alone. He was wonderful. He did a terrific job, and he would make a great Phantom. Andrew Lloyd Weber is wonderful, eventhough he stole most of his stuff from the early Italian composers.$LABEL$1
It's just plain WRONG!!!!. How could anyone make Barbie Arwen and Aragorn dolls, that is wrong on so many levels!Tolkien did not write the Lord of the Rings to have dolls made out of his characters to be played with by 2 year olds who can not even start to grasp what the Lord of the Rings is about and the fact that Tolkien was a genius!People should not by this it is just offending! I mean honstly Barbie itself is just lame, but they don't have to bring in a brilliant film and book into their stupid toys made to amuse stupid 2 year olds!!!! Come on now honestly, I just can't believe they did that!!! Grrrrrr...$LABEL$0
A Gem. My sister turned me on to this cd years ago, when it first came out. I didn't even know who Christinia was. She stole my heart. And till this day, I still pull this cd out and listen to it. What great talent, a treasure.$LABEL$1
excellent and souful music. I thoroughly enjoyed the first cd although it was kind of pop sounding. But this cd is very well written and performed. Joey's voice has really matured. The lyrics have a great deal of meaning and depth. I normally listen to OZZY, MARILYN MANSON, and NIN, but this CD is a definite change of pace. If you can get it, do so because it has a beat and it is a cd that anyone will like. When I told my niece about this "new" discovery, she asked if I had been living under a rock. This cd is probably one of the better ones I have, so do get it, you won't disappointed. I am looking forward to his next cd. :)$LABEL$1
Love It!. It is so refreshing to receive a product and it's just as it was described. I love this grill and and it works just as they said it would.

GABO, AT HIS BEST, REJOICING IN MAGIC REALISM. A tropicalized Abelarde-et-Heloise-like story, in which a rabies epidemic is confused with diabolic possession. A beauty of Spanish + African ancestry, already incubating rabies, is pursued by a monk who was in his way to become a saint. Both the young woman and the monk fall for each other with a passion that challenges State and Church, the latter intent in destroying them through its instrument of terror, the Inquisition. They cannot win, of course, but they shake both structures. Her hair does not stop growing even after death. The estate of the decrepit Marquis and his love/hate relationship with his un-titled spouse of mixed origin are only surpassed by GABO himself in his Autumn of the Patriarch.$LABEL$1
Ripped me off... Bait and Switch PRO's!. I ordered this item and it was a complete bait and switch... I was charged 51.00 US and was shipped the ONE piece (hand masker ONLY) and was NOT given my change back nor DID AMAZON do anything about it once I complained to them of these guys pulling the bait and switch. This said I STOPPED spending my hard earned money here altogether, as they need us/our money much more than we need them. Until they either give me the product that I actually PAID for I am not spending another dime within Amazon which is unfortunate because most vendors here do indeed have great products and morals as to NOT pull the old bait and switch. The major problem I have here is that Amazon did NOTHING after I placed a complaint in their system... You think they have your back until you actually get ripped off to find they actually don't care.Bu-buy Amazon.$LABEL$0
Camp Counselor Needed Equipment!. When I was a camper, my counselor would read Tajar tales to me at night. I loved to hear about the misadventures of Tajar and when I was very young and had a very huge imagination, I swear I really did see Tajar right before I left camp! Now that I am a Girl Scout counselor (at the same camp I went to as a child) I continue the tradition and read Tajar Tales to my campers every night!$LABEL$1
Petsafe Battery Review. The Petsafe Battery does not live up to the specs that indicate that it will be approximately 3 months life. One of the recent batteries I purchased was completely dead in 2 weeks. Typical is 2 months.$LABEL$0
Fantastic!!!. Since purchasing this original for my son, it has gone through three children, all of whom can't get enough of this book. Even my eldest whom does not enjoy reading, will gladly read this to his younger sister. I recommend this book for any age. The pics are simple and colorful. The language is relateable to all.Great enjoyment!$LABEL$1
NOT VERY HAPPY. I BOUGHT THE DYSON VACUUM AFTER HEARING SO MANY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT AND READING ALL OF THE REVIEWS. I MUST SAY THAT WHILE IT DOES PICK UP A LOT OF DOG HAIR AND DIRT IN YOUR CARPET IT DOES NOT GET IT ALL. I HAVE A HOOVER WIND TUNNEL, AND I WENT BACK OVER WHAT I JUST VACUUMED WITH THE DYSON, AND IT PICKED UP A WHOLE CANISTER FULL OF DIRT AND DOG HAIR. SO WHAT CAN I THINK BUT I JUST WASTED A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY ON A VACUUM THAT I SHOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT, AND JUST STUCK TO MY HOOVER. THE CANISTER IS A LOT EASIER TO EMPTY ON THE DYSON VACUUM. BUT IN THE END I AM A LOT MORE CONCERNED WITH GETTING ALL OF THE DIRT AND HAIR OUT OF MY CARPET AND THIS DYSON MODEL DOES NOT DO IT.$LABEL$0
Good and funny!. Anyone who's ever planned even one wedding knows how out of hand things can get. This poor woman is a bridesmaid in three separate weddings in one summer, so she's tearing her hair out even before the murders start! If you're planning a wedding, and about to kill the caterer or your future in-laws, read this instead.$LABEL$1
Good book good insight. Very insightful. Looking forward to reading his other book on war. Hate how you have to have a word count to leave a review.$LABEL$1
Respect and admiration for a brave bibliophile. Wow...this lady can READ! If she's read half of those she's recommended in two volumes, RE-read many of them, AND found the time to write these books-listing-books atop that, well...I'm truly impressed. That's a life well-lived in the world of reading.It's all a matter of opinion, but a few of her suggestions were outright bombs where I labored to get to page 10 (Amazon probably will strike me down for saying so, but thank God the library's free). Then again, there were a few which more than made up for them-and which I'd never have tried otherwise. I was delighted to find a few of my own favorites among her lists, and some that I'd found to be blatantly missing.The important thing is to keep reading once you find an author or a style you love. If it's not on Nancy Pearl's list, it could-and should-be on your own.$LABEL$1
awful. worst microphone I've ever used. lots of noise, loss of signal within feet of the receiver. had to order new microphones same day. yes it's cheap so I don't expect nearly as much... but cheap trash is still trash.update:ended up buying this: Nady DKW Duo VHF Handheld Wireless Microphone System and it was worlds better and still very affordable.$LABEL$0
Finally got a copy.... After hearing this on XM radio for well over a year, I finally got a copy in the Amazon market place. This is some great, jangly guitar pop. I hope they're still around, and make another album.$LABEL$1
Well, I had some reservations, but not anymore.... It's not Soundgarden, and it's not Rage: it's just Audioslave. The name may be cheesy, but the music speaks for itself. It's a blend of thundering guitar riffs in "Set It Off" and "Show Me How To Live" that only be from Tom Morello and soul-pounding songs like "I Am the Highway" and "The Last Remaining Light" that have established Cornell as the most versatile singer of the past two decades. There are a few slow moments in the album with "Like A Stone," but make no mistake, rock has finally returned to the ariways. I really didn't care for the CD upon the first listen, but after the second, I was on board.$LABEL$1
Great VALUE!!!!. I purchased this frame as a Valentine's gift after doing a lot of research online. I am very satisfied with the overall quality and appearance. The internal memory is great and easy to fill using the suplied USB cable. Also the ability to use the SD card right from our camera was a plus.The only con I have on the frame is the instructions included. I was a little disappointed in the depth of the included instruction sheet, but the ease of use overcame the lacking instructions.I would buy this product again without a second thought.$LABEL$1

Wonderful to give to a new mom!. My mother gave this book to me right after my son was born. She liked the general mothering idea it proposed - sort of a "whatever you do, so long as you do your best, all will be OK." It was wonderful to read Maria's thoughts on motherhood (and all of it's ups and downs) while I was still adjusting myself. I read most of it while breastfeeding (the early months can be marathon feedings)!$LABEL$1
Sylvania 6615LE - Excellent choice for small crisp picture.. Unpacked the item, and immediately plugged it into my HDTV Set top box using the component output. Voila! a beautiful 1080i picture as stated in the technical specs!.. I then hooked it up to a 2.4Ghz audio/video sender connected to my satellite dish and voom! now have crisp satellite images from the living room TV in our Kitchen, with a very nice, compact 15" self supporting GREAT television set!!. Did I mention it is now a WIRELESS TV?.. Tons of great things you can do with this TV/HD Monitor that many stores that sell the item don't even know about. Fry's electronics said that this set couldn't be capable of displaying HD at that price! Ha I say!$LABEL$1
Fine for killing time on a 5-hr flight, but mostly boring.... Grisham's "The Street Lawyer" won't keep you turning the pages with excitement like his earlier novels ("The Firm", "The Pelican Brief"). There's not a whole lot of suspense, fear, or emotion in this novel -- the main character has an epiphany that leads him to leave his high-paying, power law firm for a street clinic, helping out the homeless with their legal problems -- not the stuff of a thriller. To be sure, there's some contrived tension arising from some shady characters threatening physical violence and the hope that you're still reading The Firm. But the story mostly just unfolds and then gets resolved. At least the main character doesn't end up living in Aruba at the end of this story :-)For true Grisham fans (and I'm one of them), it's a quick and easy read that you might as well add to your collection, but it won't leave you talking about it the next day like many of his other novels...$LABEL$0

too much M$, too primitive. This book is horrible, too much IE5 loving. Has no or very little XSL references, but has a couple of chapters exclusively por IE5. Otherwise, it's too primitive a book, and doesn't allow to extend knowledges. Has interesting appendixes, however$LABEL$0
the secret of her success. Gail Evans sets down the rules, both spoken and unspoken, that it takes to get ahead and be successful in business. Because they were created by men, following them as a woman presents a different set of challenges.Luckily, Evans lays out these rules in a practical, sympathetic manner. I guarantee that even if you're already a successful business-woman, you'll find at least a few things here that are helpful and surprising.Sexist-sounding or not, men do see the world differently than women, at least when it comes to business. Women, Evans argues, are socialized differently and because of this need to be aware of how men have set up the game, otherwise they will continue to be overlooked. That's why a book like this is such a help.$LABEL$1
Great for cooling down your steering wheel!. This is an elastic, fuzzy cover for your steering wheel. Nothing fancy, but it does what I wanted it to do, which is keep my steering wheel from getting to searing temperatures during the summer in Houston. It slides around a very little bit on the wheel, but it doesn't bother me at all. My last one (same thing) lasted about 3-4 years before the elastic broke. It didn't fade or degrade during that time either. It was one of the few options that didn't have dragons, or butterflies, or flames on it too. So if your looking for a nice plain cover to keep the wheel cool, this is the winner :)$LABEL$1
Surprising disappointment. I gave up on King when he stopped writing horror a few years ago, but had to pick this one up. The Talisman was one of the best King (/Straub) books, so it seems that a sequel would be a sure hit. Unfortunately, this is not really a sequel to the Talisman. Its more of a horror/mystery story with some talisman references tacked on to the end. It was a good story, but the whole time I kept thinking how much better it could have been (Imagine Jack, Henry and Beezer on a journey through the territories).The first 500 pages could have been a lot shorter, leaving more room for what we really want - Jack in the territories again.I think the high point was the tie-in to the gunslinger series though, wonder how he talked Straub into that?$LABEL$0

Disappointing. Having purchased nearly every ballpark book in existence, I have to say that this one falls short of the mark. The author, evidently a Dodger fan, (pages and pages on Dodger Stadium and Ebbets field) gives scant information on many of the parks with some really poor pictures, when pictures are provided at all. For example, the author never shows an interior picture of the new Miller Park. There are much better books dealing with ballparks - skip this one, its not worth the money.$LABEL$0

Great first part story. Much like his earlier work "Disinherited / Legacy / Debt of Ages" in scope and feel but with a deepening sense that the main characters will not "live happily ever after". This book seems to be the historical background of a multi-part epic and I await the next installment with anticipation.$LABEL$1

Britney is terrible. This is more proof that Britney is a joke, she'll be out of a career in maybe...a year or two. Once the little boys and girls who love her grow up and realize that there is real music out there, they'll desert her. I thought the DVD prooves that she is terrible. Anyone thinking of buying this DVD, DON'T. All the 5 star reviews are from little kids who would give Britney 5 stars if it was great or bad, and bad in this case. Don't buy this DVD.$LABEL$0
Bifocal shades. Excellent product, performs as advertised. I use them for cruising and everyday use while riding my motorcycle.My only issue is the ear pieces seemed a little tight in the back, but a hot water soak and a little bending relaxed them and fixed the problem.$LABEL$1
So very odd.... I bought this book because of the good review I read in 'Preview' and was really kind of confused when I actually sat down and read it. I have never read anything like it, the whole set up and style was foriegn to me. I found the story itself pretty depressing. At least the parts of it I understood. I can see how some people would consider it deep and moving, but when I finished it I just felt like I had been tricked out of fourteen bucks. Read the first few pages of the preview on this site, it gives you a pretty good idea of the tone of the book. Wish that I had done that.$LABEL$0
Gotcha journalism. For documentary, this movie is far from objective. It's almost as bad as watching a Michael Moore film: a bunch of cleverly edited gotcha questions and responses$LABEL$0

A Big Disapiontment. I was really looking forward to reading this book, but half way through I was still waiting for it to kick off. Unfourtunatly it didn't, the book is very slow, and the ending was quite poor. I don't think i'll be reading any of her other books, not impressed at all.$LABEL$0
Typical China Junk. Most of the good reviews are on older models. The new ones are made in China. Typical Chinese quality control. The "0" ring on the lid will leak after awhile, if you use the lid to drink from, the coffee tastes like plastic. Who knows what chemicals China uses in the plastic liner of the cup.Also, it says it holds 34 ounces. Maybe, all of the way full.......but not with the stopper screwed in.I had one that lasted 2 years. Thermos would not give me a replacement. I am looking for a new thermos, but I will never buy another Thermos branded item.$LABEL$0
Poor performer. I have a smaller spt sh-1507 model heater and I've been happy with it, so I bought this thinking its big brother must be better. This heater feels and looks like cheap plastic similar to what you get with those cheap toys you win playing skee-ball. The unit ran for hours and never heated up the small room 10x12 room it was in, even though the smaller sh-1507 could heat it up just fine. The digital controls also appeared to be flaky. As the unit oscillated, I could see it change the temp 4 times in a single oscillation. We used this for about 2 days before we boxed it up and returned it.$LABEL$0

A nice change. Actually, I'm not a very big fan of the Stars. But when I picked up this album I loved it. It's refreshing, different, a little twangy but not overly-so. It's definitely a departure from the Stars...but isn't that the point of going solo? I say bravo...and frankly I think she has done just as well as Emily Haines.$LABEL$1
Don't waste your money and time. Junk - Professional junk, Don't waste your money and time buying this garbage, it's really noise, slow, it doens't do thin slices at all and you only can work 10 minutes, after that you have to live 1 hour to cool it off. What kind of proffesional equipment is this?? Shame on Amazon, selling this kind stuff. Please be more carefull on what you sell. If is possible try it out before selling. I'm really, really desappointed.$LABEL$0

I REALLY REALLY WISH I COULD HATE THIS GAME. Being one of my most wanted items on the top of my Christmas wish list last year I was really happy when my Survivor game arrived courtesy of Santa himself and I couldn't wait to play it. The day after Christmas the trouble began as the game froze while trying to load an immunity challenge and I ended up starting the game again and the day after that the game froze AGAIN at the very same part and starting the game over again was very tiring for me. Finally tired of messing with the game i took Survivor out and popped in the Sims and I was really happy. Mark Burnett should be really ashamed of what Infogames has really done to the computer games of his creation. And people and diehard Survivor fans will be disappointed with this game. Let The buyer beware,P.S. Mark Burnett could you ask Infogames to create a game starring my crush Rocco Dispirito plese?$LABEL$0

HORRIBLE BOOK - WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I am a network engineer with almost 10 years experience. I have typically shied away from certification tests because I have always found them to be of the "right answer, wrong answer and TEST ANSWER" category. Security+ is absolutely no different but my job required that I take this certification. I signed up for a class at the local college and this was the textbook for that class.I read the book cover to cover twice, skimmed it twice more, answered the end-of-chapter questions, took the practice exam included on the cd over 20 times and passed everytime with scores 85% and higher. I failed the security+ exam. The difference between the questions on the test and the topics in this book was amazing. DO NOT RELY ON THIS HORRIBLE BOOK TO GET YOU THRU THE TEST. IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.If I could have given it negative stars, I would.$LABEL$0
Disappointing. After reading the claims that this book would turn the world on it's ear, I was expecting a whole bunch more. There's been more than 50 years of scientific research into fossil fuels, I find it difficult to believe that all of a sudden everything we know about oil is wrong. A few quoted technicians versus 1000's of teams of geologists and research specialists doesn't seem like a fair match.This book didn't prove it to me, oil is fairly obviously becoming harder and harder to drill for, and more expensive to bring up. The Canadian Shale takes almost as much energy in natural gas to produce the oil as it's worth, and they can only generate a million barrels a day. Hardly enough to make a difference in a world that uses 89 million barrels of oil per day.For another book in this category I highly recommend Michael Ruppert's "Crossing the Rubicon". THAT book makes sense, and scares me as a see the effects of our diminishing cheap oil supply.$LABEL$0

Forward thinking. I believe we are all given a brief time to share the gospel with others. And in the process, we should always be looking for others to "take our place"...so to speak. The Leadership Baton gives a practical view on how to do just that. These are people (the authors) who have obviously "practiced what they preached" and are genuinely serving God, remembering we are all here for a brief time. And we all should be asking the Lord how we can help others become servant leaders. I recommend it to anyone in leadership roles in the church, be it as a profession or a layman.$LABEL$1
True Appalachia. If you have an interest in Appalachian cultre, history, literature, or women this is a must. I discovered this book while doing research on female Appalachian writers (a genre largely ignore by the literary communiy). These writers will touch your heart, bring a tear to your eye, bring a smile and make you laugh out loud. The best collection of Appalachian writing I have had the good fortune to come across. A wonderful way to experience Appalahia if you are a stranger to the culture, an even better way to remember it if you've left the area, and finally a wonderful stroll down memory lane if you are living it.$LABEL$1

Ho-Hum, the humor is kind of mean. I watched this once and wasn't too impressed. I did not see the original so didn't know the back stories, but I still felt like I knew what was going on. Nothing jumped out as being good, however, as a mom, I don't think I want my son watching this.Hood goes into training with a group of women known as "Sisters of the Hood." There's women there of all ages but there is one old lady who seems to be the comic relief. As in, a rolling pin hits her and that's supposed to be funny. I'm not sure why, but it's supposed to be. Then later on she falls (not sure why, maybe something else hits her) but then the head lady steps on her. Hard. In fact she walks all over her. It's like she did it purposely! Why is being mean to an old lady funny? Is there a back story in which this old lady did something that I am unaware of? I didn't like my son seeing this kind of behavior. Which actually worked out well because even though we saw it once, he never asked to see it again.$LABEL$0

challenging theme, bad writing. For those who feel the dramatic difference between the 1950-1960 generation, and that of 1970-1980,and are troubled by it, this book is the answer. It compiles all the possible reasons - psychological and sociological, explaining why the young are what they are and behave these days. The facts and figures cited are interesting and convincing.However, the writing is dry and technical, semi-scientific, could be much more lively and artistic if case-reports, personal stories or interviews were added.$LABEL$1
Battery Life is horrid. I was given this drill/screwdriver as a gift. Right off the bat, it would not hold a charge for more than 24 hrs. And to top it off, the battery is not user replaceable.

Learning to Read with Reader Rabbit. I ordered this software for my almost 4 year old who loved the Reader Rabbit Toddler software, but had outgrown it. To get the most out of it, your child should have the ability to hold and click a mouse, and should already have basic recognition of capital and lower-case letters. The lowest level is perfect for my child but would have been too difficult at ages 3 - 3 1/2. The software teaches both letter and word recognition as well as phonics. The games are cute and when your child gets tired of learning to read there are fun songs and graphics to listen to with "reading propaganda" lyrics about how fun and important it is to learn to read.$LABEL$1

Riki-Oh I just wasted 25 bucks!. I had high hopes for this film--based on the reviews I read here. I'm a big fan of kung-fu and silly horror films like Evil Dead. I thought this movie would be the best of both worlds. WRONG! This is not a kung-fu movie, it's just a gore film. The "fight" scenes don't even last 30 seconds. Riki simply makes one attack and punches through the bad guys' chest or head. Buy this only if you're a fan of Dead Alive, not if you're into kung-fu.$LABEL$0
A confusing, poorly written book. A very poorly written book. Many grammatical errors. Tries to justify the Jews as the cause of all problems. No coherent theme. Does not make the difficult Middle East situation any clearer. I'm glad I didn't spend the money to buy the book.$LABEL$0
More than I expected. I have had this watch now for about a month and it has definitely exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting the quality to be as high as it is - the band alone is probably worth $25.00.I was very surprised that the dials stay readable(not bright)all night long. I have had more expensive watches that wouldn't do that. Also the date magnifier is really nice.I am very pleased!$LABEL$1
Nice. This is a good piece of workout equipment, especially because it is so slim and portable. My mom uses it and then folds it up and leaves it in the garage. Very handy and looks durable too.$LABEL$1
A Good Read. The book is told in first person, storied format, which made it really enjoyable to read. I could care less about whether or not it's non-fiction (which the author claims), it's a good, suspenseful espionage type story, that teaches you a little something.I didn't read it looking for political knowledge for debate, I read it to have something to read, and it was good, plain and simple.$LABEL$1
Its Not As Good As Everyone States. After reading the reviews, I immediately went and purchased the CD. The CD has a few (maybe 3) good tracks, however, it is not the greatest CD that I have heard. I purchase alot of R&B and I would rate this CD on the lower end of those purchased. Maybe he'll improve over time.$LABEL$0
Big Rock Candy Mountain!. I remember watching these videos when I was a child, and I hope my children will enjoy them just as much as I did. Especially Big Rock Candy Mountain and Wee Sing In Sillyville. I never knew what these movies were called when I was younger so being able to find it today and remember what they were just by looking at it..brought back tons of wonderful memories.Especially since I go around and ask people if they remember "little bunny foo foo." Now I finally know what movie I was reffering too. :]$LABEL$1
Absolutely Amazing. I absolutely love this stuff- I don't suffer from dry skin but I use this as an all over body moisturizer including my face- I take a tiny bit in my hand and add a splash of water to it and am able to moisturize my whole body- a little goes a long way. Really great product$LABEL$1
Absolutely Atrocious. The self-aggrandizement is downright nauseating. Randal can easily put you to sleep with his "knowledge" and "insight". The title is a little misleading since you dont even hear a thing about Bin Laden till the sixtieth page practically. All you get from this is how the Bush administration is comparable to the Nazi propaganda machine with it's "Big Lies" and that Israel is the Great Oppresor. His constant chastizing of the Bush administration as simpletons toward their policy on Terror is quite comical since his grand idea is appeasement/containment. Wow , do you think he thought that one up all by himself. Bold thinking I'll tell ya. His blather is extremely numbing anchored by his favorite word, comeuppance. I would give it a negative star if I could$LABEL$0
Hard to read. Not very interestingThis is not the type of book I enjoy and would not recommend it to anyone to read$LABEL$0
Excellent music!. This Kate Wolf anthology has many of her best songs. There are some from each album.It has the words and chords. You can make up your own strumming or finger picking.$LABEL$1

The Book of Fate. This was the first time that I read this author. I was intrigued with the Masonic reference and was extremely disappointed in the scarity of masonic references. I also felt the book started slowly and gradually gained speed, but by that time, I just wanted to finish. In fact, I almost put it down mid-way.$LABEL$0
I must have missed the part about the blood.. I know there was a lot of literature with this product, I did not get through the literature before I found the product hazardous. (Two days.)I am only slightly overweight, but I have found pregnancy weight difficult to get rid of, so gave alli a try. Now I am quite unhappy, and mildly fearful, for having tried it.I can handle a little bit of gross farting and loose stools, but the spots of blood made me very nervous.I threw my pills away. Good luck everyone else.$LABEL$0
A quick reference to those forgotten legends. First thing you will notice is that this is definitely a picture book. I has pictures of great works of art that depict different interpretations of great legends (and I believe them all) from around the word and throughout time.This book is a keeper. As time passes and your interests move form one location to another this book will get you off the ground with the basics. I checked out Persephone as I have a copy of Dante Gabriele Rossetti's Persoperine in the library. I found references and related art peppered through the book. However, I seem to remember her eating six pomegranate seeds, not one.The book has a clear well organized table of contents (also with pictures), an extensive cross-referenced index and easy to read layout.$LABEL$1
A "MUST-READ" for parents with extremely difficult children!. My husband and I both shed lots of tears during the reading of this book. Finally! Someone who really understood what we were going through! And to read actual case histories of children just like ours.... I can't tell you the extent of the relief we felt just READING this book. We knew, before we even tried it, that it was going to help our family. Dr. Greene writes in a crisp, easy-to-read format, interjected with humour here and there. This book will be your bible in helping you to manage your chronically inflexible, explosive, difficult child.$LABEL$1
Didn't like the material. Its press board I wish i had paid more attention before i purchase. The product has gr8 reviews but i am regretting after buying this item.$LABEL$0
Not quite what I expected!. One might think that since this book is a "tribute" edition it could be a colorful and ambitious item. Don't be fooled fellows! Close to 95% of the pictures are black and white and of very poor quality. I`ve been trying to get my hands on this book for many years and now that I have, can't help but feeling let down. Probably because my expectations were set on the pictures. However if you`re only looking for a retrospective essay this might actually help.$LABEL$0
Delicious and salty. It's very delicious and I love salty foods .. But I wish that contains olive oil instead of safflower oil :($LABEL$1
Bad Advertising. I ordered this product before christmas and i put down Gamecube for the system and i got a PC disc my son can not play the PC disc because he does not have that, I would advise you to ask the seller questions before buying.

Of Mice and Men. Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck was set during the Great Depression in CA. In this book there are two characters called Lennie and George. They are the two migrant workers, who had travel together and they want to save some money and buy a ranch of their own. George is a small person, ¡quick and dark of face¡. He always takes care of Lennie and he act like a father to Lennie. Lennie is a huge man and has a mind of a child. He always gets into trouble. Every time when Lennie gets into trouble, George always gets him out of the trouble. Lennie acts like a son to George. Will George and Lennie make their dream come true or will Lennie¡s weak mind and strong body destroy their dream?The book Of Mice and Men is a good book. I will rate it as four stars. In this book, it has a lot of conflicts and events. Also it tells us how important friendship is event if it is a very hard time. Friendship will help you get through anything.$LABEL$1
waste of money. I bought a product from Calphalon Commerical Non-stick product line and it was great, so I thought the new Calphalon One should have better quality as they are promoted. It turned out to be a big mistake. I used the product once and it was discolored, besides the cleanup is not as easy as the non-stick edition. I decided to return it right away.$LABEL$0
Great deal for universal charger. Very good price for a USB wall charger that actually works. I use this for our iPods and phones. For some reason it doesn't seem to charge my iPad which is strange because it's basically a USB charger and should charge all USB devices. Not sure if this is a defect or my case is an anomaly, but all in all very satisfied with this product.$LABEL$1
not worth buying online. these tattoos look fine, but only have a very few in a pack. definitely not worth buying online bc they get sent in this ridiculous, wasteful packaging. just go to your local museum or little toy shop to pick up a pack.$LABEL$0
Poorly written...not the usual witty humor. I bought this thinking my 5yo son would love it, as he loves all things Scooby Doo. Well, Scooby and Shaggy are in it, but not very much. Also the Arabian characters all sounded American, and the khalif was a whiny little white boy with glasses...who thought that was appropriate??? And after watching 20 minutes and seeing none of the rest of the gang, no mysteries or puzzles to solve, my 5yo asked to turn it off. That was a first. And I had to agree with him...this movie is just plain boring, and certainly not respectful of the culture.$LABEL$0
Defective merchandise. The base of the feeder was cracked and the water poured out. Had to be repaired before use.$LABEL$0
Makes a good cup of coffee, BUT.... I was disappointed after spending $90.00 for this coffee machine. Cons: It is cheaply made, no insulation, very loud, and no water filter. Now the thing that makes me most crazy is the screw down cap on the carafe, it is extremely hard to open after you brew the coffee because the heat from the coffee distorts the cap,, making it next to impossible to unscrew to get your first cup of coffee. The cap has a thin edge with small bumps to grip, very bad design. It slowly gets easier as the coffee looses it heat. Pros: The water comes out at 200 degrees which is a good thing for making a great cup of coffee. The coffee stays hot for a long time like 5hrs. If you don't mind all the negatives than this is the coffee machine for you.$LABEL$0
Dirty when received.. I was very disappointed when i received this item. I received one that had a stain looks like a blood stain. I cleaned it and it did not go away I was disgusted by it. I was very upset and return the item.$LABEL$0
Tootsie does not suck :). I have to admit, I was never really a fan of 80's movies. Very few movies filmed in the 80's have ever appealed to me. So after watching Tootsie, I was glad that I had found one comedy made in the 80's that does not suck. In fact, it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, an unemployed actor who pretends to be a woman in order to get a job on a soap opera, and raise enough money to produce his roomate's new play. Bill Murray plays his roomate, and is very funny in this role, one of the funniest I've seen him in actually. Dabney Coleman plays Ron Carlilie, a character you can't help but hate, because of the way he treats Julie. Jessica Lange as$LABEL$1

thoughtful, in-depth daily study. thoughtful, solid, in-depth daily study organized to cover passage/topic over the course of several days/weeks - application questions and prayer suggestions are well crafted.Superior to many daily devotional books in its depth because of the multi-day attention to a single challenging passage; MacArthur is always solid Biblically!$LABEL$1
Easy, effective.. Loved it so much for my one foot's Plantar's Fasciitis, that I got another one to keep my other foot healthy as well. Better than the "against the wall" stretch - a deeper better stretch. This along with getting inserts helped my symptoms go away. (Took 2-3 weeks of just consistent 5 mins 2 x/day, but keep doing it - don't give up!) Also, ice before/after exercise & I did Epsom Salt footbaths as well before I would go to sleep.$LABEL$1
Terrific product. I wish I would have had this years ago!!! I've tried every method of hair removal available, this is far and away the best!Far less painful than waxing, more practical than shaving.Within an hour of first getting this I had done my legs, arms and face. It is very fast and works right into my regular routine.I noticed that it worked best on 1-2 day stubble after shaving.Tip: Use a loofah sponge to reduce ingrown hairs.$LABEL$1

The Way I Feel. I have become an instant fan. WOW!!! This is the best albumI have heard in a long,long time. Remy Shand is a twenty three year old muisical genius. Every single track is awesome, I can't even say I have a favorite,they are all my favorite. I have already purchased 2 CDs and plan to purchase more to give as gifts. Remy is a wonderful fresh mixture of the old school,Marvin Gaye,Al Green,just to name a few. This guy is here to stay! WOW,WOW,WOW!!$LABEL$1

Simply inspired. I bought this item as a gift for a woodworker friend and he said that some of the material was very helpful and the rest was "simply inspired." I guess that means that there are helpful tips that are explained in a very user friendly fashion.$LABEL$1

Good but needs some more explanation. I have been reading this book for a couple of weeks and have found it very helpful in my journey towards understanding Java Development. There are lots of examples and the book is generally very readable.I do have a critiscism though. The book in some area's could have done with a little bit more detail in its description of some of the tasks provided by ANT. For example in it's covering of the <apply> task the use of the <mapper>, <srcfile/> and <targetfile/> tasks within the context of the <apply> task was only 2 sentences. Although the authors had covered <mapper> in a previous chapter they could have discussed them a little bit more in the context of thier use within the <apply> task. I had to sit down and work out how to use them rather than relying on a clear explanation by the book.All in all though I have found this book helpful and I now feel as if I understand ANT quite well.$LABEL$1
Revelation in fiction - awesome. I read the entire series and loved it! It is a great introduction to the book of Revelation and what the End time may look like, on a personal level. If you have seen the movie, don't write the books off yet!The characters have depth, the situations are believable and line up with scripture. It is easy to see this happening in the near future. This is a great book for evangelism as well!$LABEL$1
you have to read this book. Amazing. Try to remember what it was like to live in your heart. Your future depends on it. A must read$LABEL$1
Miserable, boring book. I picked this book up with the hope of finding a strong, moving story of a child fighting death. And, for a while, it was pretty good. But the problem is it's basic plot: child fights death. For 100-something pages. The book basically begins with "Johnny is going to die. Lemme tell you all about it. Every day of it." And so on. The plot is alright, but there needed to be more added to it to keep things interesting. It tells you of his slow struggle with death by nearly each excruciating day. Most of the time, it's nothing interesting at all! It's like: Johnny went in for testing. Now I'm going to tell you all about his cancer, all over again. And the testing that happened, and what witty things he said to the nurse, and so on. It's awful. I skipped twenty pages, and I found I was able to pick up exactly where I had left off twenty pages ago. I had missed nothing. That's how much it drags. It's a miserable excuse for literature.$LABEL$0
Eerily Refreshing!. I watched the movie on TV & am now going to add the DVD to my collection! You're constantly pulled into the plot but never quite know until the end, just exactly what's going on. It's one of those that keeps you on the edge of your seat, all the way to the end, of which the outcome was also a different surprise! It keeps you constantly guessing who's good & who's evil!$LABEL$1

Polemic Leavened with Invective. Islamic terror and its roots are an important and fascinating topic worthy of someone who actually speaks Arabic and is a scholar of the region's history. This gadfly book is composed mostly of invective and polemics. I recommend to anyone who seriously wants to consider this subject the work of Professor Bernard Lewis.$LABEL$0
A ridiculous, hateful and missinformed piece of garbage.. Anyone who is not a complete idiot or blinded by their own religious allegiances knows that the reasons Arabs despise the United States are our ridiculous foreign policies and unabashed imperialism.To suggest that Islam is concerned with the destruction of Christianity and Judaism is complete nonsese. One quick look at the historical record should prove to even the most ardent Lindsey supporter that he is utterly wrong.$LABEL$0
Substandard product. The cable is skinny and no mark to indicate the wire gauge or any standard body approval. However mark on the male head indicate 250V 6A, which obviously mismatch with the cable capacity. Furthermore, the male metal prongs thickness is so much less than the standard US plugs and cannot stay in the wall socket. It falls off from wall socket very easily.$LABEL$0
USA Today the Complete 4 Sport Stadium Guide (2nd Ed). An useful book in 1998, getting bit useless in year 2000. A lot of that has to due to old stadiums long gone and new ones coming on line. A book like this needs to be updated every other year or something. 1996 is simply too outdated to be useful to current travelers. I also wish there were more information on nearby lodging instead of one or two entries and a map on how to get there. For a guide book, its rather limited in scope and information. Still, its the only book of its kind right now so we are stuck with it.$LABEL$0

Not for babies with sensitive skin. These wipes are very rough. We bought these when our daughter was first born and I ended up not using them on her because she would scream everytime I used them. If your baby has sensitive skin I would recommend the Huggies Newborn or the Huggies supreme wipes. Wipe your face with one and you will see how scratchy they are. Imagine how your baby's bottom feels afterward.$LABEL$0
Not What I expected.... I ordered this for my husband. It is not good. This Tea has a funky smell and tastes the same. I thought it might just be us so I gave a box to a friend.(I've got alot of it) She came to me the next day and asked if I had tried it? I lied and said "No, Why?" She told me "It's kinda funky tasting and it stinks" She gave it to her Mother-In-Law who is Vietnamese but I haven't heard how that went. I'm hoping the MIL likes it so I can unload the other 5 boxes.Very Disappointed.$LABEL$0
Too much cheese!. I was disappointed in this production. While it had all of the elments needed for a good video, even some humor, it lacked in performance. It was over-acted and cheesy!!! I was hoping for something fun, uplifting, and decently performed. Veggie Tales beats this by a long shot! Turn down the cheese factor and put more solid acting and you might have a decent film.$LABEL$0

WHY WHY WHY. Okay, I was willing to overlook the music changes this time around, because I really enjoyed this show, and I grew up with this school. For better or for worse, Dawson's Creek will always remain in the back of my brain. Season 3 has alwasy been my favorite, but when i heard that they music changes where so drastic that the theme song is being replaced, I had to put my foot down!!!Columbia why would you do this, or better yet, how could you? Don't you know that fans would rather have a MSRP of $80 or so for an additional disc (to lower compression) and to make ***MOST*** of the song???I can't in good conscience recamend a DVD with the WRONG THEME SONG... Two stars is because I could never give DAwson a 1.$LABEL$0
Boy(band) was I disappointed.... I guess I got completely swept up in my new love affair with Robbie Williams. I really was excited to order this retrospective of music of the band that help shape and mold the funk/pop/sex-god/in-yer-face Robbie Williams into the master of Escapology. Nothing on this CD remotely reminds me of Robbie. All I can say is thank God he was able to escape with his talent! Not only is the music here sappy (and, believe me, I expected that to a degree) but the recording is weak. I have to turn the levels up on my system so high that when I play any other CD the volume scares the hell out of me. Weak songs, weak voices, weak harmonies and a weak recording make for an investment I regret. I do enjoy owning, if not listening to, the peppy remakes of "How Deep Is Your Love" and "Could It Be Magic" so I guess it's worth the two stars.$LABEL$0
Doesn't live up to the hype. The first time I read this book I thought it was great, then when I re-read it I realized that just too many wierd things happened to the Piper family. If you want to read it, read it for it's depictions of New Waterford and Sydney, N.S., which are dead on.$LABEL$0
Tres Jolie. Beautiful as always. I love Daniels voice no matter what he's singing. He is an amazing artist with incredible versatility. I prefer this and Comedies Humaines(my fav cd in general) to some of his early work, which can sometimes feel a bit dated. You can tell they were done in the early 90's. It's funny, I don't speak french but for a couple words and I prefer his french albums to the English, they seem more poignant. This ablum is a bit lighter than comedies, more upbeat. For a good preview visit his page on myspace, and as always, I have to say: If you haven't listened to Notre Dame yet, forshame, and if you like his voice at all then you must listen to Le Petit Prince.$LABEL$1
This CD rates. I first heard this concert in the late 70's on the radio- it was also my introduction to the Strawbs. I thought the playing was very powerful especially the keyboards and I particularly liked their rendition of No Return and Simple Visions. I still have a soft spot for it (I was thrilled when it was finally re-released on CD) and would strongly recommend it.$LABEL$1
Good, even if defective. I bought the double sun/insect mesh even though I only have one child in anticipation of the future. It works fine even with only one seat. It goes on pretty easily and my 2 month old can see out of it just fine.My mesh came with a missing snap in the back, but there seems to be no issues, we generally only snap the top snaps to keep it in place. And I do wish it had a flap to get to the baby easier. Overall it is a great product and I don't have to worry about my baby getting sunburned or bit by bugs while I am running.$LABEL$1
NOT made in USA, even though description says so!. While this rack set is nice, it is made in Taiwan, Not "Proudly made in the USA by Nordic Ware" as the description states on Amazon's website."Made in USA" is THE reason I chose to purchase this specific product. Shame on Amazon and shame on NordicWare for the false advertising!$LABEL$0
Classic document. You don't know about boogie, about Canned Heat and about this period if you don't know this album. The 40 minutes Refried Boogie is the ultimate jam session I know of. Parthenogenesis shows that Canned Heat can also do something else than this nonstop boogie, Going up the country will stay as a classic tune, other tunes are good standard Canned Heat. I enjoy the booklet with a good complete presentation written in 2003, saying that this album is a "extreme double LP": I agree. Now it's time to boogie !$LABEL$1

Outrageously-priced shipping. Don't pay the RIDICULOUS amount for shipping for this item. You can get the exact same product at a better price at www.mybrandsinc.com. Just look under "O" for Otter Pops. For the same amount of Otter Pops at this site, it was roughly $12 cheaper than what this guy wants. (For this guy's product, my total was $32 with shipping. At www.mybrandsinc.com my total was $20 with shipping.) This product is a rip-off! If I could, I would give it zero stars.$LABEL$0
Legendary.. Are you kidding? What else can be said about the best series of RPGs ever. My love of the post-apocalyptic realm started with Wasteland on C-64 and culminated with these classics. With only the excellent Stalker:SOC to tide me over until Fallout 3, its been a long wait. If you've never played them and turn-based is not your cup of tea then I would recommend Fallout:Tactics, faster paced and real-time.BTW not being able to get the game to run on your system is not a reason to give a game a bad review..patches are easily found by competent users.$LABEL$1
Clifford family fun pack. I ordered this product more than a month ago and paid for it as well. I have not heard from the vendor, and heard from Amazon last week that I would get a refund if the product was not shipped within 30 days. Of the 4 products ordered the day I placed my order, I did not receive 3 of them! I have never had this happen! Poor service and lack of communication by vendor. Amazon at least followed up. I am in an awkward place, I need the item and have paid for it, and don't know if I should reorder from another vendor. Awkward place to be in. Be warry of this vendor.$LABEL$0
A husbands Journey to save his marriage. I was so pleased with this novel. I was very anxious to read it, after I had read the Notebook. I absolutely adored the character Wilson. He was so determined to convey his ardent love for his wife in the most exquisite way I have ever read on paper. The story revolves around Jane and Wilson's daughter, who Jane thinks is rushing into a marriage with a boy that she has been living with. Throughout the novel Wilson endeavors to become a better husband by cooking elaborate dinners and attempting to lose weight. The novel also includes Janes affable father, Noah, who aches the loss of late wife, Allie.This novel will not dissapoint Spark fans...it delivers a strong message that marriage is sacred and should never be taken for granted.$LABEL$1
Clone Wars makes up for what was lacking in the prequel trilogy.. Season One of the Clone Wars is simply put, outstanding.Voice work is great, CGI is beautiful to look at, and the music (even though it's quite a departure from William's standards) is also perfectly done.Even though the epsiodes are each less than a half hour, they all have a huge scope and nice character development.While it is animated and broken down into the short episode format, the Clone Wars has greater story strength and is even more "adult" than the prequel triology ever was.For Star Wars fans new and old, and even those left with a bitter taste from the prequel era films, you owe it to yourself to check out Season One of the Clone Wars.$LABEL$1
Decent ear-buds, especially for it's price range. These have decent sound quality - while it doesn't sound like a 200$ or even a 50$ earbud; it's still a significant improvement over stock earbuds.Especially with bass - I didn't expect bass like this from a 20$ earbud, let alone a 10$ earbud.The design is simple and rugged: the case even resisted my purposeful attempts to crack it.Now as for the downsides: The case's cover pops off easily after a while, and the cord is really, really short - I sometimes have to tilt my head when it's plugged into my computer.Secondly, the sound is very sensitive to positioning if you don't have the cover - it gets muted if I tilt my head in the wrong direction, and it feels awkward. And it's still an open-ear earbud, so don't count on this when you're mowing the lawn or something else noisy.Still a good choice if you aren't willing to pony up an additional 10$ for better earbuds.$LABEL$1
great product. Great product, shipped very quickly, not too slippery straight out of the box, so good to use right away. The 1/4" thickness is nice on the joints. Nothing special, but no carrying strap, which would have been nice to have.$LABEL$1

Genuine Transformative Art. Transfigurations is a beautiful book that does an excellent job presenting the work of Alex Grey, one of the most important artists of our times. There is no artist quite like Alex Grey. For many years, I have used this book and an earlier Grey book, Sacred Mirrors, as a transformative tool both in my own life and helping others.$LABEL$1

Simply Outstanding! You will not be able to put it down!. I settled into the large Volume 1 on a transAtlantic flight and was thoroughly immersed in this story 9 hours later. The plot is excellent, the characters well-developed and likeable, and most noteably, the characters exhibit common-sense and do not do things which leave you commenting, "That's ridiculous!"...$LABEL$1
1 Star is 1 Star too many.. Even though this arrived in perfectly undamaged packaging, the table top had an ENORMOUS gouge across it that looked like someone'd lost control of their Dremel grinder. And since the packaging was fine (even that thin, gauzy plastic covering the piece) that means it left the factory in that condition. I thought I'd assemble it anyway. Just for kicks. The screws aren't quite long enough to use the washers and still be able to catch the wood. The cabinets doors aren't wide enough to cover the cabinet opening - there's about a half ince gap there - and one door is warped or something so it doesn't stay closed anyway. This worthless contraption could never have sold for the $350+ stated original price. Save yourself the trouble.$LABEL$0
yellowcard does it again. with power-pop beats and true punk sound, the boys that are yc have cemented their status as great artists. with songs like believe realting to 9/11 to other tunes like view from heaven, this cd concludes the prospect of taking deep lyrics and light sound and creating a dazzling mix in the end.-cali_surfer009$LABEL$1
more info please. I won't buy any supplement w/out first seeing a complete list of ingredients and hopefully a more developed Product Description, of which this product offers neither. If the product description holds some weight, substantiating the merits of the product, then i next look to see the products' list of ingredients, preferably by being able to view the back of the bottle. Reading the reviews is not enough; at least not in this case, though the comments about the expired dates were certainly disturbing.$LABEL$0

I have waited years for this. Finally it's here!!. The show is great, probably in the top 5 of all time best cop shows. The quality of the picture is great. The only problem I have is that it's not the full season. For the price we paid, it should have been the full season or a couple of bucks more. This entire series, if bought on DVD, will cost more than any other out there. I know many are waiting for the distress sale from Amazon when the price will be cut in half and that's a real shame. It's great to see this quality TV show.$LABEL$0
Best CD of the Year. This is by FAR the best CD I have purchased in the past year. No Mermaid was the first song I heard on the CD when it was first released, and I instantly fell in love with Sinead's mellow, wistful music. And the CD is very complete. There are some catchy, faster moving tracks like No Mermaid, Whatever it Takes..., and Diving to Be Deeper. Then there are slower, more penetrative tracks like Don't I Know, Hot on Your Trail, and Loose Ends. The song What Can Never Be actually made me cry. I love EVERY song on this CD; and there are few CDs I can say that about.$LABEL$1
Great book!. Great book and for a great price. I recommend the Cat's Cradle on Kindle version. I never read Kurt Vonnegut book before and this is a good start for anyone who wants to delve into this venerated satirist.$LABEL$1
TaxCut Next Year. I've used TurboTax since 1986 and this is the last year. I would rate this product a 5 except for Intuit's activation scheme so I'll rate it a 1.While I had no problem activating TT using the internet, I now find that I'm going to have to reformat my hard drive in the immediate future. This will require that I reactivate the product to continue to use it. The same will be true if I change out the HD or buy a new computer. Also, each time I use the program, my registry is modified on the next boot which is a direct result of Intuit's activation scheme.I haven't let others use my copy of TT but I feel like I'm being punished anyway.$LABEL$0
It's not a story about a Lost Eden. It is about a Restoration Plan. I thought it was really something about Africa's Lost Eden, like they were able to capture on film the last "Eden" Animals in Africa, without humans. I don't want to see humans in "Africa" or "Eden"-themed films. I waited for about an hour for the real story to begin but as soon as the bull elephant died, the story was over even before I knew it. What a total waste of money! And there's only one story in it. Oh wait, I couldn't have waited for an hour because it was just 50 minutes. The only redeeming part of this film is that you get to help National Geographic when you buy their films. When I think about that, I do not really regret buying it.$LABEL$0
Only for a long flight to San Jose, CA. Somewhat interesting, but I should have known that there was trouble brewing when I spotted a typographical error in the second paragraph of the dust jacket of the book. The main character's name was mis-spelled. The book reads like a dream...disjointed, rambling, and out of focus...probably best forgotten the next day. Good for a flight across country, but only if you have already read the day-old Tribune that you found at the airport. This book seemed to have been created from the cuttings of the editing floor of another book and stitched together with a very fine piece of twine. Two stars if you have little else to read on your journey.$LABEL$0
A Great Guide to the Mysterious World of Trent Reznor. This book has an in depth way of showing you around the world of Nine Inch Nails and it's mysterious creator, Trent Reznor. The book is filled with pictures,interesting facts you can't find anywhere else, plus it has a complete history on the band and its ever-changing members. This is the number one Nine Inch Nails book and portfolio. Great Job Martin Huxley!$LABEL$1

Wow. What a P.O.C.!. I'm not an audiophile, so the sound is fine with me. My problem with this is the design of the cabling. I'm not a fan of the assymetrical cord lengths. Besides the assymetrical cord, the worst part of airbuds is the rubberized cord. This material allows for the cable to easily tangle. If you are tempted to put your earbuds in your pocket, please be ready to spend a few mintues untangling them. Very frustrating.$LABEL$0
Good AP book. This book was just a little disappointing in that it didn't have alot of concrete advice, just kind of general ideas that I already had in mind for parenting. I still would recommend it though because I really like Dr. Sears and think that what is in the book is pretty good, it just wasn't exactly what I was looking for. If you are new to the idea of AP parenting then this is a good one for you, or just struggling with what to do, it might be a good reminder.$LABEL$1

Vinyl Version - Bad Sound Quality - Sounds like a CD. I like the songs. This review is about the vinyl album. It sounds like it was cut from a normal 44khz CD. It sounds dull and lifeless like CD's do. Might as well buy the CD instead of vinyl.$LABEL$0
worse HP ever. Over the years I have always purchased HP Laser printers for my business. This is the third generation, and one would think that they would improve, but not in this case. I have never had so many problems with a printer in my life. I have 2 of these running (and i use that term loosely) on a Mac and Vista. They both constantly hang up and I have to power them off and then on. HP support said I needed more memory, but my previous HPs with less memory never had 10% of the problems that these do. It is because of this printer that I have had to install "Baseball bat free zone" stickers around my computer. Otherwise they would have been trashed. This is my first review ever, but with the frustrations I have had with this printer - I couldn't not rate it. If there was a zero choice, I would have picked it and even that would have been generous.$LABEL$0
HomeBelly Groove {LIVE}. The Spin Doctors HomeBelly Groove {LIVE} is their second best album. I love the into when they play What Time Is It this CD is great if you love the spin doctors im sure you will love this one.

The sound on this CD is the best quality ever so take my advice and buy this on amazon for the best price believe me you will love this CD.$LABEL$1
Terrible product. I wish I would have read reviews.. This memory card literally failed the second time I used it in my camera. I was on a once-in-a-lifetime trip, and lost over 400 meticulously created photos. I/O error appears to be unrecoverable even after trying several data recovery programs. I am absolutely furious. I haven't yet talked to customer service, but from the sounds of it, that will likely be fruitless.DO NOT BUY THIS CARD!$LABEL$0
Not good!. I don't get what all this hyps is about this cd. It's not even that good. Very overrated. i have to admitt that "Yeah" and "Burn" were good tracks but his third single "Confession(pt2) has to be one of the worst tracks i have ever heard in my entire life. It has no point and it lacks substance. The beat is just awful. And the other ok songs are "Caught up" and "Bad girl" and thats it. This cd will be in the rash can soon. All usher talks about on this cd is relationships. Man give us something we haven't heard yet. Dont' buy this cd. trust me. You will be disappointed. U mind as well just buy the singles "Yeah" and "burn", but dont buy this cd. Its not recommended and even my best freinds heard it and they don't even like it.$LABEL$0
No problems great video. Installed on my second generation HD rear projection TV without the DVI input.

I kept waiting for something to happen then it was over.. I purchased this movie on pay per view for 7 dollars.The previews looked great but the movie was just stupid.Loud thumps someone standing in the hall one second and gone the next,very cliche.The ending was not very suprising and really didnt explain the rest of the movie.The acting wasnt all that bad but not enough to make this movie good.If you want to see all the best parts just watch the preview for free.$LABEL$0

Insightful Indie Film: Pattern Behavior inspiring new Patterned Behavior!. "Lift" is a great film addressing organized urban crime. The more significant message, however, is the depiction of inter-generational patterned behavior. Kerry Washington and Lonette Mckee shine as mother and daughter each acting out of their own individual emotional turmoil.The interaction is remarkably true to life. Director Demane Davis brings inter-generational issues to the surface and forces viewers to face behaviors most people would rather hide in their closets. Watch it!$LABEL$1

Another Rip-off. No matter how many Punisher movies they make or comices they sell, two things do not change.1. The Punisher continues to be a clear rip-off/imitation of the Executioner, Mack Bolan, series. All the way from the character's background and motivation to the uniform and weapons he uses to even a war van which was another Executioner series original. Except the Executioner has a sense of right and wrong, emulates the true meaning of justice, yet does it with heart.2. For approximately every 5-30 "bad guys" the Punisher kills, he ends the life of one innocent person.If you believe the end justifies the means and do not mind a few innocent people getting in the way, then you're the type to enjoy this immitation of the largest selling book series in history.$LABEL$0
Wow - that's really fresh goth!!!. That is really excellent stuff, I liked the older Darkwell releases, but this one really kicks ass...It is a completely new approach to the genre...It is a bit like Evanesence but still more innovative and "metal".

The vast majority were giving a defective disc or no disc message.Stay away from Ritek/Arita and whatever other off-name they use.I now use Taiyo Yuden and I have never had one single problem with their media.

I truly believed she didn't have a bad book in her!!!!.

Such a warm, sexy sweet scent.. Rich, sweet scent that smells like caramel and warm vanilla. This is not one of those cheap teen perfumes that fades away quickly. This fragrance lasts and a little goes a long way. I can't wear the strong floral, heavy musky perfumes simply because they give me headaches, so Pink Sugar saved me from that. So glad I've finally found my signature scent. Thank you Aquolina!$LABEL$1
Don't waste your money. I've had the same problems as everyone else, trouble tracking satellites, trouble maintating a signal. The main reason I'm returning it though is power consumption. I can't feed my visor 8 triple A batteries every day just to play with gps, and even then the sporadic functionality is very frustrating. The fact that no car adaptor is available for this product is ridiculous. Wait for a better company to release a springboard gps.$LABEL$0

Last Junior Year. I read this book for the first time when still in grade school. I loved this book because I could relate with the horse subject that it contains. So many times the "horsey" books are written by authors who are not really familliar with how life really is in this strange horse show world that some of us live in. This book, although was in places very fictional, also had many realistic aspects to is as well as many true to life locations of horse shows as well as people. I hope to find a copy of this book for my daughter, because I am sure she will love it as much as I did.$LABEL$1

Disappointing. As other reviewers have noted, this is a very disappointing version of Sudoku. In addition to their complaints, I would state that I get the same board offered multiple times (both Sudoku and Kakuro). I don't know if this is because I haven't met some minimum time? Speed is inhibited by the navigation of the game (at least it does let you wrap around from the top of the screen to the bottom, etc.).One thing I do like about the game is that, being new to Kakuro and not very quick with math, the game tells you when your math does not add up. When I get more proficient with Kakuro, this may become a "leave me alone, darnit" feature, as it is currently on the Sudoku side of the game.Brain Age's version is soooo much better - can't those folks just put out an independent Sudoku?$LABEL$0
Doesn't harden very quickly. This product seems to be durable, but doesn't harden very quickly (to the point that you could sand it). The hardening process takes a few days, maybe because it was cool here at the time of the repair (around 55-60 F)...$LABEL$1
Low water mark. There weren't many occasions when America's greatest film actor, James Stewart, was flat-out terrible in a movie but this is one of them. For reasons no film historian has been able to explain, Stewart's remarkable skills as an actor deserted him in the early Sixties, and he was never the same. It's an atrocious performance in a Civil War film that is full of them. Only James Best as a Rebel veteran manages to bring some life to the proceedings. The script is sickeningly sanctimonious and made all the worse by the incompetent direction of one of Hollywood's all-time hacks, Andrew V. McLaglen, who also blighted the later years in John Wayne's career.$LABEL$0

No longer a good product due to cheapening of design. This used to be a great baster - the best. I am sorry to say that the manufacurer decided to make the walls of the bulb out of thinner silicon than they did just a short time ago. This change has made it nearly useless as a baster as it now lacks "sucking-power". It is truly unfortunate that an excellent product has been rendered useless by a short-sighted decision to save some money. Shame on the pin-head(s) responsible.... shame. I have little experience with other ISI products but this baster says a lot about what you can expect from ISI.$LABEL$0
For Retro Fans Only. With their screeched falsetto singing and synth based disco beats, it's obvious where the Communards roots lay. They are eighties dance pop mavins from the gay pick up scene (think Pet Shop Boys or Bronski Beat), not surprisingly, there music has not aged well. Those nostalgic for the time may enjoy them, but their dated boogie will win no converts, at least not until 80's retro really comes into it's own.$LABEL$0
2 failures in less than a year. We bought this unit to use in our daughters room. We use it specifically for the CD player to "sing" her to sleep at night. The first one we had died after about 4 months of use. Putting any CD in it resulted in it saying no disc. Philips replaced it at the cost of shipping which wasn't too bad, but now our second one has met with the same fate after another 4 months.I have no idea what the cause is other than poor quality components. My wife has a philips CD clock radio (earlier model) that is more than 6 years old. She uses it every night before bed and it is humming along just fine.I wouldn't recommend this model. Until you see a change in model number I would assume that the same poor QC has gone into all of them.$LABEL$0

Horrible Product. The light-bulb is very low voltage, the "lava" is very poor quality, and the water is cloudy. Don't make the same mistake I did, I thought that there was no way Amazon would actually allow the selling of such a defective product, but I was wrong. These lava lamps are horrid in every way, as evident from their horribler and cheap manufacture from China. These are not worth $14. These are trash.$LABEL$0
This book helped me. I couldn't figure out why I was having such problems with my mother. She was always difficult to deal with, and was very mean to my sisters when I was growing up.

A Guide On How To Be An Irresponsible Owner!. Even after 14 years in animal control, I still am sometimes surprised at how well people can rationalize their irresponsible behavior where pets are concerned. And this lady made money off of it! A woman who has no regard for either the dogs nor her neighbors, I also find it hard to believe that her behavioral insights can be respected when even her own dogs ignore her "leadership" by the end of the book. A very regrettable book that glorifies dangerous, unthoughtful and uncaring treatment of dogs.$LABEL$0
Too Much. I use to be a big fan of Britney, but now shes all about being sexy. I really don't know much about this CD, some of the songs may be actually good. But, since I no longer like her, especially for her appearal, I don't take the time to listen to her music anymore.$LABEL$0
What happened???. I can't believe that I actually spent money on this before listening to it. If I had, I'd be $8 richer and believe me, I wouldn't mind, money's so tight right now! This is by far, one of the worst cds I've bought this year-its' actually painful to my ears. The lyrics suck and the music, well, I wish I could say something positive. I guess the only thing going for this cd is the first 2 tracks, but you can find "Friends & Executioners" on Wired Injections (Cleopatra Records) and that cd is a much better investment than this, dare I say, album. Save your money kids.$LABEL$0
Voice like Velvet. Sarah Vaughan is my favorite jazz vocalist. I like Ella Fitzgerald, but I like her best when she is singing slow, moody tunes. I can listen to Sarah any time and any place. She brings the goods!This cd is from her later years and she doesn't use vocal acrobatics all of the time, like most young vocalist do, she knows her instrument and takes the tricks out of her bag when the feeling hits. You've got to hear her do the "Trolley "song. I don't want to compare her and Judy Garland, because I like them both, but you've got to hear it. Also, her version of "The man I love", mmmmm! you haven't heard anything so fantastic if you love this kind of music.$LABEL$1

good for a stick nailer. This gun has been used and abused and I have never had a problem with it. The only downfall I have is that the capacity is not even close to a coil nailer. If I had my choice I would have one of each, due to the fact that both have their advantages and disadvantages. Overall though, after using it on actual job sites, I would recomend this nail gun especially if you are only going to purchase 1 framing nailer.$LABEL$1
A waste of money. I bought the WinTV tuner to use primarily as a video capture card. Frankly, I believe using a computer as a TV monitor is a waste of a good computer. I intended to use the WinTv-PVR 350 to convert video tapes into digital format but when attempting conversions the computer freezes up. I have lots of RAM and plenty of room on my hard drive. The longest capture I have managed so far is 15 minutes, but most range in size from one minute to six minutes. After spending a day splicing together the fragments of a VHS tape I converted with the 350 and which I then burned to DVD, I discovered the quality of the image far below DVD quality. It is far below video tape quality.I am willing to spend some real money on a good video capture card but it isn't the WinTV 350. It's not useful as a capture card and it's too small to be a doorstop.$LABEL$0

A waste of plastic and metal..... This is without a doubt the most brainless movie ever made. Created for the "Frat Boy" demographic, Coyote Ugly is packed with scantilly clad hoochies dancing around on bar tops and acting very badly. The hoochies are impressive but that is the only halfway worthwhile aspect of this dreadful film. The plot is a stupid retread of the "small town girl goes to the big city" story ,the producers did'nt even try very hard to make a decent film around all the "T" & "A".Why would anyone want watch Coyote Ugly at a theatre or buy it on DVD when movies like this can be seen on late night cable seven days a week? At least the "acting" is better on those cable shows.$LABEL$0

We used this cup happily and without incident for 6 months until my 1 yo hid it in a cabinet overnight. When I found it the milk inside had curdled, now I can't get the smell out of the cup even after several attempts to sanitize it. I am afraid the cup is a lost cause and we can't use it for anything anymore, my son refuses to drink out of it because it smells.$LABEL$1
Call it what it is.. Clearly this was a termination. Most of us would be honest and call it an abortion. For those who claim that since the baby was born alive it was not an abortion, not true. Many abortuses are born with a heart rate. For people who are so "right to life" I think they have walked a fine semantic line by not confronting the truth about this baby's death.

NO INCREASE IN MY LIBIDO!. Being over 50, I had high hopes for this product. I so wanted to recapture that excitement with my husband. I tried it for 2 months, taking as directed. I noticed no change whatever. I'm still in love with my husband and he with me regardless.$LABEL$0
Forgettable. I didn't like this book. I found it really boring. I had to force myself to finish it. The heroine was too perfect, and I didn't feel that she and the hero had a lot of chemistry. I prefer passionate love stories. They were so dull together. I don't think I'll be buying another book by this author.$LABEL$0
Interesting Title but Little More. Coming on the heels of "Icebreaker" this ranks as a major disappointment from John Gardner. The plot and prose is a collection of disjointed and very uninspiring ideas for our hero James Bond. However, several of these ideas did seem to make it to the screen shortly after in some of Roger Moore's later Bond films and Timothy Dalton's first outing. "Role of Honor" ultimately has a rambling plot that leaves the reader totally disinterested. I was very disappointed with this novel.$LABEL$0
History forgot this one because IT SUCKS.. If you look at the majority of the reviews on the other DVD page, they all complain about this being too campy and too cheesy. Well let those reviews warn you- Bond and space do not match.I'm not going to mention the plot here since it's just plain ridiculous. But this is indeed the third worst Bond movie ever. When Cubby came up with the idea for this abortion, he said something like "It's not science fiction, it's science fact." Well if we're supposed to believe that Space in real life is Star Warsish, than this is indeed "Science fact"- a Turd of one, that is.It's just a complete and utter disaster. A completely inane and stupid plot, a bored looking and sweaty Moore, a cheesy-as-all-hell final fight, this all equals an incredibly cheap and cheesy Bond that's disgusting and just plain awful. And what was with the "Bondola"?In short, just avoid this one. Time abandoned this movie because IT SUCKS.$LABEL$0
Really, really exciting.. In #18, Ax and the Animorphs find out from Erek that a certain top guy in the President's Secret Service was knocked down by a car. So? The big thing is the car belonged to Chapman and his family and his boss don't even know he's in hospital. When Ax and the Animorphs check him out, they totally erase the morphing technology history of morph mass replacement when they try to acquire our man H.A Third and land up in Z-space. Luckily they were rescued by Andalites. But now Ax is back with his own people. And he doesn't know if he wants to go home...$LABEL$1
Not impressed. My experience was not good with this product. I think I temporarily ruined about 3 different knife edges with this. I would attempt multiple times on each blade, but the knife would just not end up sharp enough to cut paper. I followed the instructions perfectly, but I think the one size fits all design just doesn't work well enough on a variety of knives. Go with diamond and Arkansas stones and you will be much happier.$LABEL$0

fast moving story. Nora Roberts has proved that she can tell a story. The details make you feel for the characters. You will find yourself rooting for some of the characters to pull through. You will find you will relate to these characters as though you have know them, or maybe wish you had. (I did enjoy the ghost visits, as I feel our love ones are near, whether we choose to notice or not.) The only objection I have is I do not feel it necessary to go into details with steamy love scenes! It is not that I am a prude, but I don't find this to be necessary to tell a good story. I can't wait to read the next book of hers.$LABEL$1
Sub-par guitar rock drone - their other records are better. "Magnified" is a very average record. Failure's 1st record "Comfort" and their 3rd "Fantastic Planet" (their last record before they broke up in 1997) are much more worth your hard earned cash. Still, if you like your guitars thick and loud, you may dig this one too. Coincidentally, there is a band named Magnified who have had their name before Failure used it. They are in New York City and are starting a huge buzz with their energetic, unforgettable guitar-based songs. Their independent CD is much more worth checking out!$LABEL$0
didn't realise it was particle board. I have to say I move allot so I hate particle board. I purchased this for dvd's which it didn't hold close to all of my dvd's.

If don't ever plan on moving this would probably be a good item for you especially if your good and reading directions but for me it's crap.$LABEL$0
Should be a standard reference. Dave Perkins and Evan McGinnis have put together what has to be one of the most useful books I've ever shelled out my own money for. I've been writing MIBs since 1993 and find this is the reference that I use the most. It covers the basics and also advanced topics. The authors include notes of caution and don't mind giving their opinion - which is actually labelled as such.$LABEL$1
Product is ok but. I used my marinator twice a month. After a year of use, the lid cracked and container would not hold its seal. Lid cracked along top, near rubber vac. hole. Clearly it broke from the suction action of pumping, not misuse. Loved the thing but it definately did not marinate well in 5 minutes (or even 30 minutes) but worked very well when I'd prepare foods in the AM before work and stuck in fridge. At least it made me THINK I was doing a better job.After it cracked, I threw it out and bought bag/jar sealer...much more versatile.$LABEL$0
You can't hear the caller!. It's a really good looking phone in a good size.Major con:- You won't be able to hear the caller unless you use the speaker or hands-free!- There is a major error in the user manual that took me hours to find "Settings" of the phone.- The only availible holster is in leather - not very attractive.$LABEL$0
"Operation Rogosh" on video--finally!. The great "Operation Rogosh" episode of "Mission: Impossible" featured the series' first time-displacement scam, with an environment completely recreated from scratch and a mission that, to be successful, had to be completed within a strict time-frame. To one extent or another, this first-year installment set the tone for the rest of the series, and after 37 years, "Rogosh" is still fresh, and still a model of staging and editing.Director Leonard Horn was a veteran of the sci-fi classic "The Outer Limits" ("The Man Who Was Never Born," etc.), as was writer Jerome Ross ("The Man with the Power"). Other "Limits" tie-ins include directors Lee H. Katzin and Paul Stanley, as well as co-producer Alan Balter.The second episode on the video, "The Train," is more gimmick-reliant but quite entertaining, with one especially nerve-wracking moment. To quote an early reviewer of "Mission: Impossible," fine stuff!$LABEL$1
Simple and excellent. What you need from a VCR is this modern age is simple: stereo, excellent picture quality, s-video output and an easy to use interface. It also appears to have MACROVISION handling for backing up forgotten video favorites that are no longer sold in stores or available in DVD format. Anything more extensive in a VCR (like PAL or SECAM features) involves a bunch of other issues to be considered and might clutter its simplicity. For what it is, it is a terrific (and reasonably priced) piece of equipment.$LABEL$1
Poor Quality. I received the bracelet and took it out of its packaging to place on my wrist. Upon placing it around my hand it immediately snapped in half. The bracelet was not too small but of poor quality. Also, it took the seller two weeks to respond to my refund request and then they demanded I send the broken bracelet back to them (two weeks after it had broken and had been thrown away). Poor product. Poor customer service.$LABEL$0
Il Divo Divine. This music is amazing and just think - we have Simon Cowell to thank! The blending of the four voices in harmony and melody is wonderfully soothing to my old ears and the guys are pretty easy on the eyes. I would heartly recommend this CD!$LABEL$1
It's ok. Look just buy Meteora and Hybrid Theory from Linkin Park. Now if you only listen to rap then you'll probably just buy to this album. The point is that this is pretty much the same thing as the normal songs except in the middle they'll cut and put in part of a Jay Z song or vice versa. It's better if just listen to Linkin Park album cuz it sounds better without Jay Z.Best: Numb/EncoreWorst: Big Pimpin'/Papercut - LP's best song totally ruined.$LABEL$0
Ruben "The next big Star". Ruben exemplifies grace & talent. As he sings he brings about a smile & shiver. As I've watched him, he's grown more powerful & still maintained his grace.

May God continue to be a blessing upon him.$LABEL$1
They leak all over the place!!. I used Avent with my first child iin 2006 and I was very happy and had no problem. BUT the new BPA free bottles that I am using now with my second child leak all over the place. It's very frustrating. DO NOT buy them until Avent fix the problem.$LABEL$0

Remarkable! Sure to be a classic!. This is Martin McDonagh's masterpiece---actually, I take that back. I hope he has more and greater works in him for years to come. We need them. This is a superbly theatrical tale that examines the nature and purpose of storytelling. Why do we humans feel it necessary to invent fictious worlds and examine our life not through direct observation of the real but of the invented? And in a land where personal freedoms are virtually nonexistant, how long can the storyteller survive, before he is done away with by the forces of control and order? The blackest black comedy you'll probably ever read, The Pillowman will remain with you forever. Don't just read it, see a production of it when it comes to your town, for surely it will.$LABEL$1
if you found this, please read on. I don't know how anyone will find this, but if you do and like soul music, don't miss this disc. There are songs here that are impossible to find anywhere else, and the mastering is the best I've ever heard, and that's the truth. I have a few of these cuts other places, and the sound there doesn't hold a candle to the sound here. I give 5 stars rarely and grudgingly, but I would give this collection 6 stars if I could. Worth it for the original version of Some Kind of Wonderful (boy, is it! ) alone. Snap this up before it's gone!$LABEL$1
you get what you pay for. i guess the cheap price on this should have clued me in. i ordered this for my wife. looks great on the model in the picture most likely because the use different sizes, meaning you get it and the bottoms are huge and the top is small....not anything like the proportions in the picture.$LABEL$0
very disappointed. I really wanted to like this book. I love series and especially series involving the supernatural. It was mentioned in reviews of Charlaine Harris's books (which I love) and I wrongly assumed (you know what they say about assuming...) that the Anita Blake books would be similar. Hamilton introduced an interesting universe but it went down hill from there. I didn't particularly like the heroine and the book was just so inconsistent. A group of vampires hire Blake to do a job for them and instead of actually letting her do the job, they keep trying to kill her. Doesn't quite make sense huh? Honestly this book just annoyed me to no end. When I was finished with it, I threw it away rather than inflict it on unsuspecting people at the library.$LABEL$0
Good product, good price. Arrived quickly, decent condition, works great. Just plug it in and go, didn't even have to install anything or set anything up. Finally, I can use my cd drive again! :)$LABEL$1
I love this CD!. I love this CD. I had originally heard Charlotte Church on the TV movie Joan of Arc (I love that movie!). I fell in love with Panis Angelicus. I asked my mom to get me Voice of an Angel (so I could pay her back, of course), but she purchased Charlotte Church instead. I fell in love with it. My friends may think that I am crazy and listen to 'wierd' music, being I am only 15. I laugh at that. I hate pop music! They are the ones who don't listen to good music. I at least gave their kind of music a chance. This CD is perfect. So it is played switching places with my Edwin McCain and Motzart CDs. What a combonation of music! Charlotte Church has a beautiful voice, especially for one so young. I can only imagine how her voice will improve as she as well as I grow up! --Carol aka "Lyra S."$LABEL$1
high school teacher. The content of this video is wonderful. My students just finished reading Night, by Elie Wiesel. I was hoping that this could help enhance their understanding of the themes involved with with Wiesel's experience. My students had a hard time understanding Wiesel, and being 15 year olds in their 1st period on a Friday, they weren't willing to try to understand it. Next year I will show it again, but have some questions for them to answer so they actually try to understand. I will check out the PBS supplemental items as well.$LABEL$1

Unlike the ghost and the darkness, this book will bore you. When I read this book, I was horribley disappointed. I thought it was exciting like the movie. But it wasn't. Don't waste your mone$LABEL$0
Find a proper history instead. Perhaps it's a case of, "It's the sort of thing you'll like, if you like that sort of thing", but I can't say that I liked this one. The author presents a very-nearly-interesting concept, that Custer survived the Little Bighorn fight, only to be court-martialed for his failures. However, he presents it in third-person, present tense; an unusual choice in modern literature. Also, the narrator offers the inner thoughts of a different character each chapter. The result is a style that I found tedious and forced. As to plot elements outside the realm of what one might read in a history, they appear to have been left out. Although one of the characters refers to the case as "having more intrigues than the Arabian navy", I suspect that I've known houseplants with more interesting lives. Finally, lacking any notes from the author, I'm left not knowing what was fiction and what was not. In the end, I wish that I'd read a proper history of the incident instead.$LABEL$0

Works fine. Doesn't need additional tamper.. The machine works fine. I just wanted to comment that the included tamper also works fine and the comments I'd read about needing a "good" steel tamper are unwarranted. The plastic tamper mounted on the side of the machine is hard and sturdy and more than sufficiently rigid to tamp coffee plus its the right size. Comment about "needing" a steel tamper are just pretentious dribble. If you like the looks of separate steel tamper that's fine, but it won't improve the flavor of the coffee.$LABEL$1
terrible. It is not that often I feel my IQ level goes down after watching a movie, but I think we are talking at least 3 points here. This movie is utter crap.$LABEL$0
Good for the job.. I bought recently this product and I have to say that it is working fine. I tried it with pork, beef, bread, onion and pepper and it is doing fine. It is heavy solid made product from stainless steel. However the knife and the grinder itself are catching rust, so probably they are not a stainless steel parts. For this reason I dry these parts after I wash the machine. As the product is cutting well everything I put inside I guess I shouldn't complain. I didn't try it for sausages yet, so I can't comment if it is doing a good job there. In genereal I consider the product as a good buy.$LABEL$1
Con Job. This is another example of a low-quality item passed off using a high-quality brand name as cover. This mattress is of a lower quality than most of the "store brands" I've used, and is certainly of a lower quality than the Coleman brand widely sold for less than half the cost of this Eddie Bauer version. Watch out - in this case, you're going to get less than half of what you pay for!$LABEL$0
Not Worth the Money. The case itself is sturdy and the pockets are quality but if you intend on filling up this case, don't bother zipping it up because the zipper will break and become useless.$LABEL$0
Product works great!. I bought this product based upon reviews on Amazon and have been very happy. I'm not a car freak but can appreciate a good wax. I used this after using the car clay kit I bought at the same time. The combination of the two really left my paint looking deeper and richer than ever before. I have a 2008 Altima with standard Nissan dark gray paint but it looks better than new now! Very impressed...$LABEL$1
I can understand the methodology..... I see what the insert is trying to accomplish by decreasing the pronation; However, my flat feet are so severe that this product only causes pain when worn for a long period of time or when working out. I've worn the inserts for about 3 weeks but will continue to wear them in hopes that the pain will lessen.$LABEL$0
Tedious, poorly organized, etc.. This book contains excerpts from several of Hubbard's other books, and in a couple cases from lectures. For a book the Church of Scientology pushes heavily, it's pretty awful. Almost all the 'sections' are preachy, most of the insights are unoriginal, and there are a few things which are patently offensive. For example, in one passage, "The Vocabularies of Science", Hubbard calls Japanese a "baby talk language" and proceeds to espouse his almost complete ignorance of the language. I find it difficult to believe the CofS includes that in their translations for prospective Japanese scientologists. On the other hand, if you think Japanese is a baby talk language, and also believe some of the other bizarre assertions in this book, maybe scientology is for you... In sum, I cannot fathom why any thinking person would join the CofS as a result of reading this book. Lousy, preachy, ignorant, and boring. To put it bluntly, a complete waste of money.$LABEL$0
cute...but!. I was given a set of these cards by a friend who knows how much I appreciate the Sacred Circle Tarot by Anna Franklin. Unfortunately, the Fairy Ring oracle cards are not even as half as good as the Sacred Circle Tarot who is not only beautiful but also gives extraordinary messages when used in combination with the book it comes with!The 'art work' of these cards is cute, but the messages of the cards are...not useful at all! And this is being kind! This deck is a cute past-time for those who like to play with the Fairies, and to be honest I believe the author and creator of the deck has just done that - gone off with the fairies!Satisfaction guarantee...good for a laugh but not to be taken serious!$LABEL$0
almost perfect. This is the third gravy separator I've owned. The first two were made out of plastic and I doubt that I got to use them more than 10 times before they cracked. I gave up on replacing them, since they were made out of plastic that could not stand the thermal shock, until I found this one. This one is made out of laboratory glass and has survived over a year of frequent use in my kitchen.The only gripe I have is that the spout is not profiled very well, and it's more or less impossible to pour out of it without spilling some of the liquid.$LABEL$1
Don't waste your money. I bought one of these to replace my old WearEver Popcorn Pumper (RIP). Boy what I would give to resurrect the old pumper!! The first problem is that this popper is built with the airflow straight up so it blows unpopped kernels out into the bowl. The second problem is that it has such low airflow (necessary due to the direction) that it doesn't get the popped kernels out into the bowl so they build up and scorch. Add to that the fact that, again due to the airflow direction, it pushes a large number of unpopped kernels out with the popped corn. Then add that the butter melting container is also the corn measuring cup, so you need to stop and wash it between every batch. The butter melting cup is plastic, instead of aluminum like the WearEver, so it doesn't have good heat conduction and won't melt butter that isn't already half melted.Overall, don't waste your money.$LABEL$0

Pretty dull. This game is of little interest to my six-year old, who has other Disney software that he loves. While there is some animation in the tiles themselves, there's not much else going on.

Killer Album Of Blues Covers. Where Me and Mr Johnson focused on acoustic blues ( great job btw ) , this album is quite different . It's plugged - Very plugged . If you want to know why Eric Clapton is held in such high esteem , buy this album .It's an album of covers by blues greats like Eddie Boyd , Lowell Fulson , Freddie King , Albert King and Muddy Waters among others .Clapton's guitar is at the forefront on this album .He does an incredible job with these songs and if you don't agree with people who put Clapton at the top or near the top of the greatest guitar player list ...this album will have you jumping on the bandwagon .If you like blues ..just buy this . you'll love it.$LABEL$1
Easy to use. Looks and feels good. I am not a fan of the arm bp monitors so decided to spend a little more & get this one. I really love it. I'm able to connect it to my PC to where it keeps track of my readings so I can actually get a clear view of my BP trends. It has helped me with maintaining a healthy bp level because I know when during the month I may experience a slight increase so I'll do a bit more exercise and a few more Resperate sessions during that time of the month. Also, it's Omron. You're dealing with a great company as well.$LABEL$1
Opened my Eyes to Facebook,and great story and actors ... I went to go see this movie in theatres with avg expectations at best, but let me tell you this movie delivered and then some. I had no clue the actualy story of how Facebook got started and was unaware that the guy who started Napster was even remotely involved. I am not sure how accurate this movie is to the true story but none the less, it was a well written story, and this movie wss CASTED perfectly having Jesse Eisenberg (who I feel doesnt get the acting credit he deserves, being compared to Michael Cera WAY @ MUCH), and Justin Timberlake did a incredible job portraying the guy who started Napster.I have a Blockbuster online membership,but this is the kind of movie you want to own imo, and they have a great deal for their 2 disc special edition DVD,but since I have a Blu Ray im getting it on Blu Ray which I hope includes the same material.Check out this movie.$LABEL$1
Battery needs work. I purchased this item this summer and at first it was great, picked up everything, until the battery life went south. It would work for a few minutes on full-power and then it was going dead but would run for 20 minutes. Thought I might have over charged the batter and ruined it so I purchased another one and this one I made sure that I didn't over charge the battery and the same thing happened again. Maybe I got two batterys that were lemons but what are my chances. It was great while it lasted. $20.00 a battery is not worth it if it only works for a few months....$LABEL$0

works until it melts and the cooking plates fall off. Got this thing about a year ago, and the removable plates, timer, and adjustable temp are big improvements over earlier versions. But after a few uses, the plastic cover on ours melted a bit and is now a bit deformed and ugly. AND the top cooking plate tends to disconnect when opening the thing. Today it fell off clanged onto the floor just missing my foot, spattering grease all over the place.Hamilton Beach and Cuisinart make similar products, and they are probably better engineered. Even though this one is no long under warranty, it's getting boxed up and shipped back to the manufacturer.$LABEL$0
Great premise, but disappointing overall. Four very different individuals accidentally meet on the roof where they had all planned to commit suicide.The writing was abysmal and the characters were all very flat and unlikable. There were a few insights I found interesting, but they were presented in a somewhat forced and cliche manner. This is the first book I've read by Hornby and even though it was terrible, I still might give him a second chance with one of his more popular books, such as High Fidelity.$LABEL$0
Surpasses even the sparkling brilliance of "Black Woman".. Not to take anything away from Judy's "Black Woman" album (which is an absolute classic) but songs such as "Ethiopia Salaam", "Mother Africa", "Lovemaking" and the stunning title track surpass the above-mentioned classic album's splendor and brilliance. Judy has never made a bad album and I highly recommend all of her works.$LABEL$1
30 years later, and still nothing like it.. Very few people have ever been able to write in such a way that can render nothing of the imagination or fantasy more compelling than the realities of what actually is. Incredibly, 30 years later, very few things in this book are truly outdated, and there is still no book out there which can so accessibly and comprehensively serve as a "You Are Here" starting guide to all that is. It remains an essential and irresistible read for anyone with a natural intellectual curiosity and desire to understand.$LABEL$1
Poor resolution and sound:(. Great Movie, But surprised at the quality of the Blu-Ray! One star is even too much. Also where is the sound on the movie itself? The special features and new Clash of the Titans 2010 preview has sound, but not the movie. They need to re-release this and take time doing it so we can really see Hi-Def in all it's glory. This is VHS quality, if that.$LABEL$0
eh. ... ..not awful by any means and there are very pretty moments, but the overall album just lacks in emotion and depth compared to the original. many times the arrangements are very thin and have to leave out important harmonies and sometimes entire lines. it's still enjoyable, mind you. there's just no thom yorke. the absence of his voice really leaves you wondering what to think. if the makers of this cd read these things, can i offer a suggestion that you get a whole string choir with lots of members to beef up some sections and bring back a few things that had to be left out because of your numbers if you ever want to do more radiohead. and get the real man for the melodies.$LABEL$0
Read this to be paranoid throughout your pregnancy. Although this book is written from the standpoint of presenting the facts, it does so in a warped and paranoid way. The "facts" presented in this book are not the facts but the author's extreme ideas presented from extreme reported examples that are perfect to make any mother-to-be paranoid about her pregnancy. This book will make you believe that having sex WILL cause you to have a miscarriage (which is extremely rare!) In addition, the author speculates that having one x-ray at any time in your life will cause all of your future offspring to be deformed... which could not be more FALSE. This book sells lies instead of the helpful information a mother-to-be will need. In my profession I have already had to council the fears of a young mother who read this book and received all of the wrong information.$LABEL$0
Oh god.... How the hell can they even make a movie this bad,didnt they read the script first!

Biased Ivy League reviews. This is a decent guide for the most part. The trouble is that the authors' biases are clear when they review Yale's "rival" schools. Is anyone surprised that this book makes Yale out to be the flawless shining star of the Ivy League and Harvard, Princeton, et al. to be overrated, filled with unhappy students, etc.? The not-so-subtle advertising compromises the book's integrity where the Ivy League is concerned. If those are the schools that interest you, Fiske and Princeton Review are better bets.$LABEL$0

Excellent, strong bags w NO Failures. I have been using Bags on Board for at least 8 years. I walk our dogs (2 Shar-pei's - 45 and 55 lbs) every day and have actually NEVER had a failure of a bag.

I heartily recommend these bags for durability, reliability and size - What more is there? I trust them and will continue to use them.$LABEL$1
Kept freezing on me. Couldn't even install. After hearing about how easy and intuitive an ipod is, I eagerly opened the package and after charging popped the installation CD into my computer.

Feed Your Chickens Too. I wanted something to feed my chickens with that didn't require me entering their cage. Having rabbits as a kid, this fit the bill.

The best children's book ever. I just read the other reviews of this book and feel compelled to add that it had a similarly profound effect on my life. It is only published every 20 years--1947, 1967, 1987 and hopefully again in 2007. It is the best children's book ever--an unrivalled compilation of timeless--and non-commercial--poems and rhymes. Only Shel Silverstein has come close to achieving the same greatness. I learned the whole book by heart as a child and my grown up sisters and I still recite the rounds together when we are feeling silly. Everyone should have this book in their permanent collection.$LABEL$1
Product Great but Seller is Shady. The phone that I purchase is great. It met all of the expectations of the razor phone. BUT, the product description was misleading. It said that it was "Unlocked for use with your existing GSM 850 MHz, GSM 1800 MHz, GSM 900 MHz or GSM 1900 MHz service provider" To the untrained purchaser(me) I "assumed" (you know what happens when you assume!) that it was good for ANY service provider. My son tried to use it with his Verizon account and was unable to get it hooked up. At the very least, I think that the seller should have had a link (Like the one he sent me when I tried to return it!) to explain which providers it was good for. The seller was very shady in his presentation of the product. But if you have one of the GSM providers the phone is wonderful!$LABEL$0

Funny, Fast paced. Dacinda(Daisy) Ann Minor, a character who can only exist in a little southern town, is the archetypal small town spinster librarian. But this particular old fashioned, next thing to a virgin, wants to get married and have babies. On her thirty fourth birthday, she decides to do something about it, and that's where the fun starts. She gets a makeover, moves out of her mother's house, witnesses a murder (unintentionally), buys a puppy, and starts something up with the town's hunky sheriff, who is far from a "good" ole boy. Now the romance in this book is more of the slam-bam-thanks and lets get married-ma'am variety than a Grand Romance, and the action is very secondary. What drives this story forward is Daisy, and then eventually Jack, and how Daisy's evolution changes them both. This is a very fast paced book- everything takes place in less than a month, but it's definitely worth reading if you enjoy a character-driven plot and laughing.$LABEL$1
REALLY REALLY LOUD. I have just called today to get a second replacement for the refurbished kitchen aid I purchased a month ago. The first was really loud and growly, but the second one is really loud and ear-piercingly annoying. It is hard to even be in the same room with it on. The Kitchen Aid person I spoke will said they are all noisy due to metal gears. Let's just hope the next replacement is tolerable or I spent an awful lot on a lemon.$LABEL$0

Pre-K teacher. I teach pre-k and the children love this toy! I found out about this toy from another teacher who said that the children really enjoy it. It was a bit expensive but a few parents chipped in for it and when they saw how much the children enjoyed it, they decided to buy it for their homes as well. It is a fun and safe toy. Many magnet toys are not safe for young children but these are big toys (not swallow-able) and the children can build beautiful structures with them! If there are more than three children, I would recommend getting the pack of 100 since children enjoy using many tiles to build structures!$LABEL$1
Bad design - it will crack at no time. I bought two of them. While installing them into my license plate frame, the thing did not fit over license plate. You actually have to cut your license plate edges about 1/8" at the sides to fit it into the cover.It didn't help and the cover cracked at one place near the license plate screw. Honestly, I didn't over tight the screw.I put it over my front license plate (I live in Illinois) only to protect myself against Laser radar. I think everybody who installed this cover over the license plate take a chance to be ticketed for obstruction the plate as it can be seen clearly only when you look at it absolutely straight. If you have a cop looking at your plate at the slight angle, at least couple digits would be distorted or hidden from being seen them at all. Plus I am not sure that Laser beam will be reflected from the license plate solely and not from the rest of the car.I would NOT buy this cover - waste of money!Michael.$LABEL$0

She's attractive, great at the piano, should hire a vocalist. I've never heard her cover an octave. To be fair I did give up listening to her.$LABEL$0
The running man DVD. i have been wanting to get hold of the this copy of the DVD starring Arnold Schwarzenegger since i was a young boy.However, where I am staying I cant find this dvd at all and I have been searching for this movie for years.Finally,i came across this website and I found what I was looking for.I purchased it immediately.I eventually arrived at my doorstep.The only issue was the dvd case had cracks on it,must be due to the ship handling but the 2 disc edition dvds were perfectly fine.I watched the movie and I was amazed at it special features,extras.So i decided to purchase for 2 other movies from amazon.I am now waiting for them to arrive and I am a happy customer wanting to buy more from amazon again.The one stop place for the huge database of movies.The Running Man (Special Edition)$LABEL$1

Same as The Language of Emotions. I purchased The Language of Emotions and was so intrigued by the book, I searched for additional books by the same author - I was absolutely thrilled when I came across this book! Imagine my surprise - and disappointment - when I reviewed the Table of Contents to discover the book is almost IDENTICAL to her newest book, The Language of Emotions. If I had known that, I would not have bothered to purchase Emotional Genius.$LABEL$0

An outstanding book THAT DOESN'T cover up the Masonic Connection to JFK's murder. The most important line in the book is the oneabout how the FBI used the Masonic Lodge tomeet in 1960...laying the groundwork for JFK'seventual removal by the 'Shadow Government...Ask yourselves, Mr. and Mrs. America, is itjust a coinsidence that LBJ, Hoover, Major ofDallas Cabell, the former Gen.

Love it. I bought this for my baby boy 4 years ago and the blanket/fitted sheet still look like new, even after all the washings. I loved the colors and patterns, it's what attracted me to this bedding set.

Best money spent on a pet item ever!. My cat sheds like crazy. He is a short haired cat and the only animal in the house but everything I own has cat hair somewhere. It even makes it way out to the car. While searching around for recommended pet brushes, I ran into the Furminator.....I, of course, balked at the price -- that is a lot of money to me for a brush BUT I bit the bullet and ordered anyway.I received the brush today and I LOVE it! The amount of fur it removes is simply amazing. I was careful not to brush too roughly but I would think anyone with a brain would get that it is a hard metal brush and not to brush too hard. The cat loved it and I love the fact that I get to greatly reduce the hair in my house. Definitely recommend this to anyone with an animal that sheds at all.$LABEL$1
The Corrs are awesome!. The Corrs are a young and talented band. Their music has a great uplifting spirit which will brighten your day. I just wish that they stick to their Celtic sound and don't head to where other 1990's artists end up: forgotten and in the bargain bin. If they stick to their unique sound, they will stick around.$LABEL$1

Rear Window is great Hitchcock. Hitchcock at his best. Builds the suspense and it never gets old. I've watched this movie many times over the years and it's still a great movie.$LABEL$1
annoying. The content of this book is probably ok. I was really disapointed with it as I have been to Nanchang and was really looking forward to someone elses experience of the city and of course their adoption process. The problem I have with it is that it is very badly written. I realise that being a writer is not this guys job but how it was printed like this is beyond me. I can get over grammatical mistakes and bad punctuation to a point. This book is written so badly that at times it is very difficult to get the meaning of sentances. The author changes tenses mid paragraph while talking about the same moment of time. Two stars for effort and putting the story down on paper.$LABEL$0
Hmmm.... Now THIS is weird. REALLY weird. In fact, I'd go so far and call it the "The Velvet Underground and Nico" of our generation. Okay. Tricky, onetime Massive Attack rapper, teams up with gravelly-voiced singer Martine, and makes one of the weirdest albums you'll ever hear. I'm sitting here staring at the keyboard trying to explain what it sounds like and I'm unsuccessful. Some call it "trip-hop" but I say this sounds NOTHING like "Dummy" or "Mezzanine"! Ever heard the song "Downs" from Big Star's "Third Sister Lovers"? That's what a lot of this album sounds like. Unique percussion and static melodies. And lyrics along the lines of "I drink till I'm drunk and I smoke till I'm senseless" and "I f--- you in the a--." with song titles like "Ponderosa" and "Suffocated Love". Pot hallucination experiences put on record, I guess. It's all very VERY surreal.It's also very VERY unlistenable. But hey, so was "The Velvet Underground And Nico"!$LABEL$0
Tommy Chong Died Too Early. This was not a great movie. It's usually a 50/50 chance that a National Lampoon movie will be good or horrible. The best thing this movie had going for it was casting Tommy Chong as the bus driver "Red". No surprises here.... he did a lot of drugs and looked like a roadie for the Dead, but he still makes me laugh. The problem was the character died off too soon as with any chance of the movie breaking even at average.$LABEL$0
good to a see an old friend. It's good to see Lolita Files back in the writng game. I have missed her books and her stories. This book gives great in- sight to where the characters have been and where they are headed next. This book screams for a sequel!! I like that she managed to bring readers up to date while showing a glimpse of the past throughout the book. I read this book in two days it was sooo good. I ony gave it four stars because the ending does leave you hanging for answers. Otherwise, great read!!$LABEL$1
More Christmas Magic. Hats off to John Corbett, Stacy Edwards, Michael O'Keefe, Jack Palance and the Producers of Prancer returns. We've enjoyed Prancer for so many years and were so excited to see "Prancer Returns" come out. Again, the movie has taken "every day" people, has placed them in "every day" life situations and has created a masterpiece filled with Christmas magic. A wonderful movie for everyone in the family. A must see!$LABEL$1

Delighted to see how many love this book.................. I love THE MIRROR and believe it is the best book ever published with my home town Boulder, Colorado as its setting. Those who are not big time travel fans (I confess I am not usually) can enjoy the book for its page turning plot and the historical detail Millhiser uses to make Boulder in the year 1900 come to life. I was under the impression this was a fairly obscure book but what a pleasant surprise to see it is still in print and loved by many. Great reading choice for Boulder lovers whether residents or visitors.$LABEL$1

Great book. I bought this book for a contemporary philosophy course at college, and found it very fascinating. Wilson uses science to explain a wide variety of human phenomenon. I read this book not only for class, but I found it so interesting that I read it for fun!It can be hard to get through if you don't have a strong science background. I study science for fun, so I had no difficulty. However, the less scientifically-inclined in the class had a tough time reading it.$LABEL$1

Brushes okay, but.... This toothbrush does an okay job with teeth and gum brushing but it is DIRTY! I take the top off after my twice a day use and rinse it out in hot water. I replace the two parts in their proper places each time. Weekly, I separate the parts of the brush head to clean it and inside is the slimiest black stuff...stuff I have seen inside a sink drain. I had to use another toothbrush and a q-tip to clean it. I would never recommend this brush nor would I buy it again. I am going to try to spray the insides with a weak bleach solution to see if it cuts down on the black slime. ICK!$LABEL$0

Bad Seiko Watch. Purchased this watch 12/7/2009 and gave it to my wife for Christmas present and on 2/1/2010 it died..........I took the watch to a mall and had a new battery installed just in case but it still will not work so I'll send it back to Seiko and hopefully it will be repaired..........this was an exact replacement of a watch I gave my wife 25 years ago that worked like a charm up until a couple of months before Christmas so I'm hoping I purchased a legitmate Seiko and not a cheap knockoff!!! I'm sending back to Seiko and will update this if it's repaired timely with no problems!They repaired the watch no problems and it's still working great.........as of 11/11/11$LABEL$0

This toy is a keeper!. My son is 3 years old and is beg. to like thomas the train- I purchased this toy as a starter to see if he would take the time to play with a train set. It is very cute - however, it is on the noisy side. The legs do come off very easy and cannot be glued (they come undone) He plays with it all the time and I would recommend it to others. The cars are very small so if you have other young children in the house you may want to think about that. It was definately worth the [money] we paid for it.$LABEL$1
Not worth they money. Very cute and bright pictures but this is really not worth the price. It's very slim - as the other reviewer stated. As soon as I got it I sent it right back...it's about the thickness of a preschooler's book. I'd only buy it again if it were under $7 - and I'm not especially cheap! Lots of other great dog/pug books out there that are worth the money.$LABEL$0
So far this is AMAZING!!!!!. I got the for my son after reading Dr. Bock's book on the 4-A disorders. My son is a sickly child and the winter is usually a horrible time for the entire family. He has had croup more times than I can count and basically gets it every time he gets a cold. He has asthma and many food intolerance's on top of a weak immune system. Every winter of his life he has gotten the croup at least once a month if not more. Since taking the transfer factor he has not been sick even once!! It has been two months since his last episode. I hope I am not jumping the gun, but this is a first for us! I am very pleased with this product and it is the best supplement we have tried (and we have spent tons on supplements and food already). This is worth every penny!$LABEL$1
Lasted less than 6 months. We've had a very bad experience with this blender. After not even six months of mild use, the body and the bottom part do not lock together anymore so we had to throw it out as there is no way to open it and try to fix it. Our feeling is that it has been designed with short life expectancy. Buy, use, and... buy again. We'll wait and buy a good brand whilst travelling abroad.$LABEL$0
Expected better quality. I bought this item after a bit of research over the net. I have an HP computer, and since the bag is also from HP , I expected it to be well designed for HP computers and of course durable. It is well designed but it bit too heavier than I thought it would be. On the durability side, I am surprised to find that handles are coming lose. The threads are unraveling and as of now, the bag is not usable, because handles might break off. This has happened only after a normal usage and normal loads. The load included only a laptop, few documents, power adapter and a book of about half a pound!!Quite disappointed with the quality of this product. But there are chances that this might be defective piece. I am going to send it back to Amazon/HP and see what happens.$LABEL$0
Best Music Ever. If you like Jarre music, this is the album for you. Made of one of the best of his scores ever. From the beggining to the end. Just put the CD on, sit down, relax, close yor eyes, and let the music do the job. If you're a newbie, you've probobly heard his music before. You're just not aware of what's behind. Hear it, experience it, belive it, learn it.$LABEL$1

Hamlet. Though dozens of versions of Shakespeare's best-known play have been filmed, none rival this moody 1948 adaptation by master dramatist Olivier, who produced, directed, and acted. Streamlining the text to achieve a leaner, tighter feel, Olivier wrings tremendous feeling out of his indecisive, ever-brooding Hamlet, while the radiant Jean Simmons makes an exceptional Ophelia, the dour prince's doomed lover. Distinguished by its inventive camerawork and lush black-and-white photography, Olivier's "Hamlet" won four Oscars, including Best Actor (Olivier) and Picture.$LABEL$1
A Very Superficial Book. I returned this book after reading half of it and skimming the other half. I can't find a single original observation to point to, and many of the observations about "Chinese etiquette" are really just observations about etiquette in general - such as the universal practice of starting a conversation with small talk.One particularly annoying part of this book is the author's practice of compling long lists of Chinese vocabularly, phrases, place names, and historical references, and then failing to provide the character or "tone" marks. As anyone with an even cursory knowledge of China knows, Chinese is a tonal language and, hence, without tone marks a vocabulary item is completely useless to a foreigner. Moreover, the author misspells many of the pinyin transliterations, and often provides phonetic transliterations that are non-standard or inacurrate.$LABEL$0
Poor product. I purchased one of these computers only six weeks ago. On the second time out I detected black spots on the screen, where there should have been pixels. Pressing the screen brought some of them back, but as the day progressed the marks became cracks in the LCD screen itself. I reported the matter to HP the next day and they agreed to collect the unit for warranty repair. Some 10 days later they called me up demanding $650 to replace the screen, saying they were not prepared to honor the warranty for a crack.The lid is totally too flimsy to take the stress of holding the closed unit and lifting it from a carry bag. There is a connector right where you grasp the case, and this can dig in and crack the screen. For a portable laptop the design is not fit for purpose.NB the electronics work great but without a screen are of little value!$LABEL$0
WARNING: Do Not Buy!. A much needed warning on this item: if you are searching for a way to cool down your computer because it overheats when using intense programs, this product will not stop it from overheating! This item MAY slow down the process of overheating but it will STILL happen. These "cooling pads" don't have enough power to keep your computer cooled. If your computer is suffering from too much heat and programs requiring high CPU stutter and stop, this item will not help! Beware!$LABEL$0

worked flawlessly for me. Just finished doing my taxes with it. It imported my last year's data with no problems, and continued to work without a hitch. (MacOS 9.2.2, lots of memory). (haven't tried the state version, or printing to an HP printer.) If I had a nit to pick, it would be that the point in Taxcut's interview where you enter your state tax refund begins by saying "Did you or your spousereceive a form 1099-G for2001?" It eventually goes on to mention that this is the place to enter your state tax refund even if you didn't get a 1099-G, but I missed that the first time through.On my wishlist for Taxcut would be the ability to "print" a PDF of the finished tax return. This is not so pressing, however, as there are various commercial/shareware/freeware ways of getting this functionality, and MacOS X has it built in.$LABEL$1
Double burner reversible grill/griddle. I decided on this product after reviewing many both in stores and online.I chose this griddle as it is made in the U.S., is the "just right" size we were looking for, and is reversible which is a bonus.I also like the fact that is an easy to clean surface but is also durable and sturdy. That is very important to us as it will be used on our outdoor grill most of the time. We also have other family members that will use it and it will get some rougher use that way.$LABEL$1
Undersized 2Gig card. I bought for 2-gigabyte EXTREME-III cards, because my application requied at least that much space.

Very interesting reading. Mr. Weist's proven "scale trading" method is a very interesting but unconventional trading approach that I personally could never attempt.

A Clint Eastwood-charachter Version of Enlightenment. A very male-told tale. A tall tale at that. In this version of enlightenment complete out-of-body/out-of-life detachment seems to define the experience.

As more than one person has said, if you think you're enlightened, you're probably not.$LABEL$0
Great if you're really into food shavings. I had the same experience as many of the reviewers here. This "slicer" is totally useless. If you put ANY kind of pressure down on the item to be sliced it will not cut through; otherwise you just get shavings. I have tried an onion, a green pepper, and a sweet potato; none of them were cut. The video from the company demonstrating this product (up on a certain popular tube site) is a gross misrepresentation, this thing just got tossed into the trash.$LABEL$0
Not a big fan. I liked the YES products, their first two albums were really good. This product was mixed very badly, and the songs are very weak. But I'm a big E.L.P. fan, but I'm also a recording engineer too. This product should have been thought out alittle bit better. That's just my opinion. I was never a big Rick Wakeman fan, and I've listened to some of his other works. I can't really recommend this product to others, it just doesn't cut the mustard.I've worked with other musicians who just throw some crap together and kick it out the door. Sorry guys, you should have taken some time to put together a better production. This product doesn't show a good investment of your time.But nither did some of the E.L.P. products, every dog has his day. Alot of times this happens due to label presure to put out a product on a deadline.Sorry mates, maybe next time.$LABEL$0

It's a first effort.. I actually found this book on a plane, someone had left behind-probably purposely. For a first effort it's ok. Hey it looks like it's a self published book to me. I did not find the poems very special. The poems seemed very "elementary." This probably explains why it's self published- what big publishing house would ant to put it's name on it. I do commend Aiken for the effort, although a lackluster one.$LABEL$0
Up Up Down is the funiest story i've ever read.. . I liked the book Up, Up, Down because it reminds me of my friend.

Highly Effective Tool!. I just finished reading The 25 Habits of Highly Successful Salespeople by Stephan Schiffman, and I found it not only to be a helpful and informative book, but also highly entertaining. I was afraid that this would be a dry, technical book that I would have to "choke down" in order to get the information that I needed, kind of like a kid eating spinach for the vitamins! But boy, was I wrong! I really enjoyed Mr. Schiffman's style, and I learned a lot from the information he included; a lot of it is common sense if you think about it, but he triggered the thought process. This is a handy and enjoyable reference book that I plan to keep handy, and have with me on so I can refer to it as I make my sales visits. I especially liked his summary of the 25 habits at the end -- a great "quick reference" to give you a last minute "pep talk"!$LABEL$1
Sadly disappointed in this product. After reading the reviews, I was syked to receive my order of Ibarra chocolate. I love hot chocolate, and look forward to trying new flavors and brands. I've never had "Mexican Chocolate", so maybe this is what it is supposed to be like, but I didn't like it at all. It was hard as a rock, tasteless, and messy. I followed the instructions of boiling some milk, chopping the chocolate in my blender, and mixing it together. It came out foamy, like one reviewer described, but I was surprised to find it tasteless and flat!! I ended up adding 4 T. of my standard coco mix just so I could finish the drink. This was not at all what I expected, so if any of those three reviewers are looking for an open package, you can purchase mine! In one word: YUCK!!!$LABEL$0
Not for children. The cover of this game is dangerously close to the innocent family game. We bought it at a "breakfast with santa" event, never considering there was a adult-only version. Pretty surprising for the grown ups and eye-opening for the kids! The only hint on the box (after we looked closer) was it said it was for "4 or more adults". Shame on the manufacturers - there should be a better "heads-up" warning. From the other reviews, it looks like we weren't the only ones caught off guard.$LABEL$0
Opeth - the other side. Purchased this based on the bands association with Steve Wilson of the band Porcupine Tree. I heard the instrumental passages and the mellow vocals of Mikael in some of the longer Opeth songs. It was the death metal "singing" style that turned me off. BUT all of the other stuff was great. This Damnation album is a tad too mellow for their core fans but it's a great standalone listen for anyone who loves good music. I wish the band would abandon the cookie monster vocals and just go straight forward singing - his voice is so great to begin with. Anyway - LOVE THIS ALBUM ! BUT IT !!$LABEL$1
Poor quality on these swings from Penn Plax. Although ZPets delivered these as promised, the quality is poor.The swings separate from the hooks that hang them.

Interesting Book with Depth and Style. Ivy Cole and the Moon by Gina Farago is not the usual type of book I would pick up on my own. On the surface it seems to be of the horror genre, not one of my favorites. But this 'werewolf' book is far more than it seems on the surface. I was immediately struck by the beauty of the structure as the writer weaved her tale with flashbacks and revelations about the characters. The setting, familar to me as my own backyard, only added to my interest in the story and the names of the characters were right for the area and for the story. The fascinating theme of the story lifts the book far beyond genre fiction.If you're looking for an interesting read with some chills but also with some depth and style, think about Ivy Cole and the Moon.$LABEL$1
just my opinion.... At first glance I thought McTeague was going to be a relatively boring read. However, as I progressed through the novel I found myself enjoying it and I discarded my initial thoughts about the book.McTeague is actually a brilliant, little, fiction story about the innate savagery of mankind. In the novel, McTeague is large, and seemingly harmless, man. McTeague's docile qualities are slowly shed throughout the novel and his underlying, predominant atavistic qualities and behaviors take hold.One of the great things about this fiction novel is that it was derived from a non-fiction event. In the back of the novel there is an in-depth depiction of the events in which the ideas from McTeague were taken from. For those who seek to delve deeper into the novel, there is also a section of criticisms and lots of other useful and interesting discussions in the back of the book.All in all, I enjoyed reading this novel and I would recommend it to anyone.$LABEL$1
Poor Photography Ruins Book. Very disappointing book. Comes across more as a gimmick to make some fast cash by self publishing a book that includes the authors photos combined with Christian "inspirational wisdom" scattered across the pages from Lewis, Mullins and others.The best thing this book has going for it is the cover design. It's downhill after that. The photography is poor at best. Several images are blurry, while many suffer from poor exposure, lifeless composition, and a printing that renders the photographs dull.If you are looking for a gift book or coffee table photo book with eye popping photographs with "inspirational wisdom", this book does not deliver. Do not buy this book based upon it's cover.Highly disappointed. Not recommended.$LABEL$0
a solid tale from an up and comer!!. RED RIGHT HAND is a story that tells the goings-on of a Bonnie and Clyde-type duo and their ending in a California town. It's a very exciting ride and the ending is a true killer. The characters are original, the dialogue funny and scary at the same time and the action and drama are intense. Recommended.$LABEL$1

Disgusting, didn't even bother to finish it. This author certainly left nothing to the imagination, and I really wish he had. It was disgusting pretty much from page one. I didn't even bother to finish it, and haven't watched a Bogart movie since. Thought about donating to the library, but would feel bad if someone actually read it. This one is worthy of the trash can and not much else.Bogart may have been that much of a degenerate, but this book is really too much information.

for all fans great and small. very good series, it is great to have the whole set including the two specials they made. the first 4 seasons are the best the last three have a different actress playing the role as Helen which doesn't quite work for me and there are a lot of episodes without Tristin in them and you really notice his absence. they try to make up for this by adding the character Callum but he does not fill the void, really only makes me wish to have the original Helen and Tristin back. but all in all very charming series.$LABEL$1
Careful. I couldn't believe dark craz's comments on track 4, hot bars, and track 9, All I can do. I'm writing this review simply to defends S&M, and two of the best (among others) songs on this EP. To say that hot bars doesn't flow it ludicrous at best. Bump this track in the summer time with your windows down and life won't get much better. Both of their flows are unparalleled. Granted, there isn't a deep message here; it is such a feel good song though. This track reminds me that everything is all good. Not to mention, when grouch is on the beat, there is rarely--if ever a disappointment. But that is just opinion I suppose. Maybe. Track nine, all I can do, is another S&M classic, with a solid message flowed eloquently over another dope Grouch beat. S&M, especially Murs can flow to fit any mood, they can always make you reflect, and feel good about most any situation. Basically, please be careful when writing CD reviews, there are reputations on the line.$LABEL$1
Handsome Blender, But..... Purchased this blender because it was sold as a display at 40% off. Knew nothing about it, but did some research online after purchasing. Seemed to work fine for me at first, but this morning, only it's second use, I noticed it was leaking just as many reviewers had complained. Also, the "smoothie" function produced more of a "chunky" than a "smoothie" which was very disappointing. Other reviewers have noted that the blade assembly tends to freeze up, and emits dark residue over time, as well as the motor failing after only 1 or 2 years. With only a 1 year warranty I don't feel too confident about this product. If only this $100+ blender worked as nicely as it looks I might keep it, but it's going back ASAP.Update: Finally decided to go for it and ordered a Vitamix 5200. Yes, it's expensive, but so far worth every penny. It outperforms every other blender I've tried.$LABEL$0
Da Cube:by a kid who likes Cheesemonkeys. I got GameCube, and it rocks! I got it at 7:30 p.m. and played till 11:00 non-stop! Exept for a bathroom break of course. I think PlayStation2 and Xbox are junk. Xbox should be called Crud-box! And TrashStation2! Now, back to the Cube. The Controller rocks, the games rock, what could be better? So, dont play your PlayStation2 or/and Xbox so much! Play your Cube! I bring it with me on all my trips! You should too! If you dont have one, get into your car and speed off to the nearest video game retailer! Remember, PS2 and Xbox [stink]!$LABEL$1
A GREAT READ. A great "story" based on obviously a thoroughly researched topic. I knew little about the subject at first, which is why it got my attention. My wife was also a little incredulous at first, but then we realised it was all factually based. I will be looking out for this author's next book.I also wonder if this book will turn up as a swashbuckling movie down the road. I plan on sending copies as presents to friends who love history based books. It makes one want to go to the Carolinas to check out the scene - perhaps we have our next vacation destination determined.$LABEL$1

Dog Lover Having Second Thoughts. I am a huge dog lover, but this movie had me looking at canines in a different light for quite some time while I was little. For some reason, I always relate this movie to "Sandlot," but this dog really was ridiculously mean. The scene in the junkyard made my eyes widen a couple times, and I'd give this movie four stars for being entertaining. Scary? Not at all. The book was even more grotesque, and I enjoyed every minute of it. All I kept thinking through the book and the movie was "What is taking so long for someone to shoot this dog?!"$LABEL$1

Will never buy another Epson!. I have the Epson CX5200 and loved it at first. But everyone is right...it starts to clog and then you have serious problems. I can print black and blue but no yellow or magenta, which means you can't print anything in color. I have tried everything...new cartridges, cleaning the print heads, aligning the heads, etc...nothing works. It seems like several other people have had the same issues with this series. Epson needs to correct this issue before putting other printers on the market! I am now looking for a new printer but you can bet it won't be an Epson!$LABEL$0

Stardust. Maroon Killashandra on Doona, have her meet an even more empathic and supportive Sean Shongili, extract all suspense and danger, and you'll have _Nimisha's Ship_. Unlike memorable McCaffrey heroines of yore, Nimisha has no need to grow and change, as she's brilliant, beautiful, poised, and powerful from the early pages. Even being marooned on a planet with defeated exploratory teams barely ruffles her hair or mars her manicure. It's a good thing the early settlers of Pern did not have Nimisha's ship-design skills, as they would have developed a high technological civilization in approximately 25 minutes, and we would have been denied some of McCaffrey's best books.$LABEL$0

Self-Indulgent Garbage. Having been a Junior Brown fan since 1991, I looked forward to his new release. Junior is a national treasure, and is arguably the greatest country musician alive today, maybe the best ever. However, I can promise you that this album will never be put in my CD player again. It is an insult to country music fans, and a waste of his talent. I don't object to Junior testing the limits with rock, rock and roll, and rockabilly, it's one of the things he does best. However, this effort belongs in the trash can. This album should have been titled "We Got Really Drunk One Night, Played Some Stupid Songs, And Somebody Left The Tape Recorder On". Don't waste your money on this one. Ernest Tubb wouldn't have.$LABEL$0

Smartdigital USB Repeater not 2.0. I just bought two of these. They do work but the throughput is slow. USB 2.0 is supposed to allow for up to 480 Mbs, while USB 1.1 allows for between 1.5 Mbs to 12 Mbs. These cables clearly state on the back of the package that they support 1.5 Mbs to 12 Mbs max. Thus they don't perform as 2.0. What this means is whatever you have hitched through this thing will be slowed down; example, I tried to put my webcamera on it (which does 24 Mbs) and my movements are slowed down noticeably.If you look at the cable connector box, they have stuck on a little sticker that says "USB 2.0" in red. The sticker tries to make it look like that was printed on the connector along with the rest of the labeling. Basically, everything points to this being mislabeled, previous generation product. If you want USB 2.0, and you should at this point in time, you should buy another cable, not this one.$LABEL$0
Video card not supported? Seriously?. I tried to install this game on a Samsung laptop made in 2011. I have the newest Medal of Honor game installed, made in 2010, as well as Battlefield Vietnam, made in 2004. So I figured installing this game, which is 5 years old, wouldn't be a problem. However, after finally getting the game installed, I received an error message saying that my video card was not supported. If my 2011 graphics card is too outdated for this game, I would like to know how the heck anyone played it in 2007. It makes no sense. I can run an EA game from 2004 and another from 2010 on my video card, so why can't I play one from 2007? Don't buy this unless you are absolutely certain that it will run on your system. Despite being an old game, it is EXTREMELY picky about what systems it will run on.$LABEL$0

Indispensable. I am an acupuncturist and massage therapist and use this product on my patients everyday.

Good value. Bought this adapter to power my Koolatron fridge when travelling. It works well and is much lighter than my original one (due to the fact that it is solid state based). The only drawback is that the outlet plug is a car lighter socket and the Koolatron has a 2-pronged DC plug so I had to get an extension cord to make it work. Luckily I had a spare. Koolatron should at least provide the correct plug with the unit.$LABEL$1

Eye-opening story. As an American who has never traveled to Australia, I thought the author painted a very detailed picture of the scenery.

The story was slow to develop, but once the conflicts began, it was gripping to the end.$LABEL$1
AP (Alternative Press Magazine). I purchased a subscription to the AP Magazine as part of my son's Christmas present on 12/11/10. It's mid March and he hasn't received an issue.

Plenty fo stuff to like, a few misses. How Men Are was, coming on the heels of the Luxury Gap and their massive UK hit "Temptation" something of a challenge. The production had moved from funky to more orchestral in nature, the songs less hook driven and more introspective. Still, I remember this being one of my favorite albums in the late 80s, I constantly played it and grew to love it. The Skin I'm In and Shame Is On the Rocks are classic Heaven 17 songs, full of bright pop sounds and yeah, funky I guess. The album has one of my all time fave Heaven 17 songs "Reputation," a shamefully over looked -should have been a hit single. ...And That's No Lie is a massive, almost Brian Wilson-type epic that has promise but seems half finished.If anything, compared to the first two albums this one is more mature and less hit driven. Some tracks seem like filler, portents of things to come in hindsight. Not a bad album, certainly nothing embarrassing. But just wait...$LABEL$1

don't waste your money on Cheap meters!. I have been in the RV repair industry for a long time and one thing is for sure, I cannot do my job without a top quality meter. I have in the past bought Snap-On, Mac, Matco,ect, but have never been as pleased with a meter as I have with this one. Beyond the normal functions of a meter, I love this one for its temp probe, no more are the days of carrying a therometer to take readings inside fride, a/c/ unit, all I do is plug it into the meter put the probe inside and shut the door within 30 seconds I have a very accurate reading. But probably the most important thing about this merter is the "true RMS" readings I get, this is very important when working with power converters and inverters..This meter is very well protected also with fuses (fuses are pricey though) have not blown one yet but I would recommend purchasing a set to keep on hand.$LABEL$1

Definitely a DYNASTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Michael, Scottie, Phil. Do these names sound familiar? Soemtimes one name says it all. From 1991-1993 and 1996-1998, the BULLS won the championship. This dvd set not only takes you through their arduous journeys during their championship years, but it also includes some of the NBA's Greatest Games (i.e.-Game 5 of 1997 Finals; Game 6 of 1998 Finals). This is definitely a must have for any basketball fan. Are they alongside the storied Los Angeles Lakers or Boston Celtics? That can be left to opinion, but you have to show the Chicago Bulls credit.

Pretty corny. Well, why not? Growing up with the superman TV series I just decided I wanted to see for myself how it was. I have to admit it was pretty corny. Oh well.

Fun anyway to see how it really was.$LABEL$1
Essential Stravinsky. No student or lover of Stravinsky's music should be without this book. It is a rare opportunity to see into his thought processes, and it makes one realise just how much music meant to him- that he sought to serve it by understanding it as deeply as he could.In communicating this understanding, Stravinsky makes for an engaging, if somewhat challenging, read. The book is a transcript of six lectures given by the composer to French students, and the translators have seen fit to cast his words into a large quantity of "verbal Victoriana." If at times it seems boring, it is all due to that style of language. Apart from that, it is an excellent account on the part of a man who (for all his known self-contradictions) clearly used his heart as well as his hands and his head.For students of Stravinsky, this book is essential. As a record of his personality and thought processes, it takes some beating.$LABEL$1
Buyer beware, deceptive invoicing tactics. Hearst Publications sent my mom nasty bills and letters saying she agreed to a renewal which she did not, and which she specifically wrote to them to say she did not want (something she should not even have to do).I would NEVER buy this magazine now that I am aware of their unethical practices.I fear for people without the skills to be able to assert their rights and suspect many go along with the renewal they never wanted and capitulate in the face of the nasty reminder / billing letters.Sad. My mom wonders how someone like Oprah can even be associated with such practices.You can contact Oprah subscriptions at 800-846-4020 apparently but they don't even put the phone number on the invoices and it took me much searching to find it online, no thanks to them.

Not good for LCD monitors. I bought this for my kids. They have a 21" lcd monitor which normally uses a 1600x1200 resolution. Within seconds of starting the software there was huge disappointment to see a tiny little window half the size of the screen which was the drawing area. Ok, I thought you should be able to resize it like most modern windows programs. It turns out you can't which I find amazing. 800x600 was the standard nearly 10 years ago. Things have moved on since. Ok, you can change the monitor resolution but this is a pain for my kids to do and frankly it looks terrible - the text is almost unreadable. They should really point out that the resolution can not be changed. I would not have bought this if I had known this before hand. Very disappointed.$LABEL$0

A Real Treasure of a Classic!. The wonderful story of a unique real-life 1920's family with 12 children. Myrna Loy the mother of this close knit family, will steal your heart with her dry, deadpan humor. In one scene she sits patiently in her living room listening to an unsuspecting birth-control advocate spew over-population nonsense in an attempt to get her to join their nefarious group! The father is an efficiency expert and runs his household accordingly, but not without a lot of unavoidable laughs and surprises. Very entertaining film you and your family will love. Takes you back to the wonderful time of 1910's and 1920's pre~Depression era America. The way a family ought to be. You'll simply love this classic treasure.$LABEL$1

Never really got going. I didn't enjoy this book. The story line never really got going and I could always tell what was going to happen next.In a nutshell, it's about a single 30-something career girl that needs a date for her upcoming school reunion. Predictably, she bumbles through a series of almost relationships in search for the perfect man to have by her side. There is also a somewhat random side-plot involving her not-so-happily married best friend that I don't think adds much to the story except padding.I have also read Marisa Mackle's "The Mile High Guy" which I preferred.$LABEL$0

the best show on tv.. reno 911! is the best show on tv. network, cable, pay cable, you name it, this show is the only comedy show that keeps me laughing throughout an entire episode. many may say it sounds too gimmicky, having the lieutenant wear short shorts, having a short-haired woman that is the butt of all the jokes, an ex-stripper, a trailerpark living redneck, and other odd characters that join into the mix. but the funny this is - it works. the show is all improv, or at most they all follow a loose script. i have to admit that i had never seen any of the first season episodes, but began watching when the second season rolled around and couldn't believe the kind of show i had been missing. i picked this dvd up the first day it went on sale and could not have been happier with my purchase. the show is an absolute riot. you will not be disappointed!$LABEL$1

Not for long term occasional use. We bought a version of this a few years ago to use for guests and after just having used it last night the guests had to actually crawl onto the sofa half way through the night. We've noticed for a while it wasn't holding air well but it wasn't even sleepable after a few hours. We're disappointed because this was rarely used but much needed when it was and now we have to purchase another one. Otherwise we really liked it but something about it just makes it not hold air which defeats the purpose!$LABEL$0
Dissapointed. I purchased this unit to replace an old SU2 unit that I really liked. Here are the things with which I was disappointed:The clock is very difficult to read unless you are looking at it straight and level. Angle viewing while lying in bed is impossible.Radio antenna dangling out the backThe unit is bigger than I expected (I should have checked the size)Sounds with same name are different than the old unitContrast adjustment is crude and not very usefulEven on dim the backlight is fairly bright. On bright you certainly won't need a nightlight in the room.$LABEL$0
Very Nice Product. Great quality and great looking product. Had a little trouble installing on Windows Vista, I couldn't get the Mic to work. I downloaded the software/driver from Logitech website, followed the instructions and wa-la, mission accomplished with no hassel. Love the Right Light technology and the video effects except for the Avatar video effect which tends to lose the face tracking sometimes but that's not the reason I got this webcam anyway. I'm completely satisfied with this Webcam and I only gave it 4 stars because of the size (not suitable for Laptops), it could have been a little more compact but it's OK for a 19" LCD.$LABEL$1
Great introduction to the author and his characters. A ripping yarn, I was immediately moved to buy more of the Reykjavik Mysteries, great characters, and lots of interesting insights into Icelandic society, of which I previously knew nought. Recommend it for lovers of Scandi Noire.$LABEL$1

GREAT!... Almost as good as Voyager. I LOVED this season! It's probably the best one of TNG. My personal preference is Voyager (Female Cpatains ALL THE WAY!... and not to meantion great plots, and a fantastic theme song!!!), but this is definetly sencond best. TOS is dull, TNG's great, DS9 is pretty slow, Enterprise is NOT good, but Voyager is great! If this is your first time watching Star Trek, go for either this or Voyager.$LABEL$1

This is a catalog!. My husband made fun of me for spending $10 on a catalog for expensive toys. I'm a sucker, should have read the reviews. I have to say though, given the opportunity, my one year old loves to pretend sweep and helps unload the dishwasher. She likes to "help".$LABEL$0
Not a Sophomore Disappointment. I've just listened to this album for the first time, and I'm writing this while listening to it again. This is a well-played, well-sung, well-produced album; a worthy addition to Five Star Laundry. The backing strings are a nice complement to their rockin' sound. My only disappointment is that I don't seem to have one of the limited edition CD's with the multimedia. But that's ok. The music stands on its own. Now I have two Motor Ace albums to listen to on my hellish commute, which is a good thing.These guys deserve to make it big in America, if that's what they want.$LABEL$1
Fun Movie. Great fun with Charles Laughton and story line that is well built. Marlene Detrich is a bit stiff but all in all we enjoyed the movie.$LABEL$1
Toilet-riffic! (And I mean that in a good way!). My family and I just moved to the states from Japan and we brought some Japanese toilet sets with us. The Panasonic model I picked out has a max draw of 460W, and is designed for Japanese power. While the toilet seat worked just fine hooked up to the US power outlet (which is controlled by a light switch, which wasn't on for extended periods), I didn't want to risk using the heated seat or heated water options. Once I got this product, I plugged it in, and have continued to use the toilet seat without issues. (I am still not using the heated seat due to the weather, but the heated water works without problem.)Honestly, I just have to assume it works, since my toilet seat also worked plugged into the wall...but it's supporting the <500W device I plugged into it, so until it breaks, the seat breaks or some other issue arises, I'll give this high marks for doing everything I expected it to do.$LABEL$1
Aromatic Ignorance. Ms. Austin obviously has no knowledge of the safe usage of essential oil therapy!

Leaks Like A sieve - Buy something else!!!. I don't often get as angry at an inanimate object as I did at this P.O.C. Only the second time I used the machine, and when I attempted to mount the clean water tank/soap dipanser the clean water just rushed out the bottom of the tank and sturated my carpet in several areas. I've read other reviews on this product which state that the clean water tank cracks and causes the leak.So tonight I'll inspect the clear water tank to see if it is cracked because I suspect it is another problem. If I find out exactly what is the problem I will post the answer on this review board.$LABEL$0
a book for the best web comic. Sinfest is the best web-only comic I've read. I've been reading Sinfest since 2002 and I'm surprised that it's still not syndicated.This book contains comics from 2000 and 2001. Tatsuya Ishida's art has improved since then, but even his older material is good. The Sinfest comics are all online, so you can check it out and decide for yourself if you like it before you buy.$LABEL$1
Just plain bad. This product is not capable of making double flares for brake lines. I've tried to make at least 25 flares using 3/16" brake line with this thing and all of them were uneven and lopsided. I had a friend try and he had the same result. The brake line was properly prepared before each flaring attempt. Very disappointed, but you get what you pay for.$LABEL$0

great product. Worked perfect for combining signals using RG6 coax cable from two different antennas pointed in different directions and sending those signals to one amplifier. Received over the air stations up to 80 miles away. Had tried a signal splitter from a local radio shack, but it would not allow all stations to come in. Was easy to install.$LABEL$1

I did not like this book at all!. I thought that this book was not so interesting. The author went off into to many different directions, and never stayed with the same situation. Also, the book didn't really get interesting until the end. The end of the book was really messed up, it didn't really make sense. Also, I thought that the story didn't seam to have a lot of thought put into it, thats why it was so boring!$LABEL$0
Blink 182 is the Backstreet Boys of Punk. Note: This is a review of the band as well as the album.That's right. You heard me. I compared your favorite "punk" band to a bunch of no-talent prettyboys whose songs all sound the same. Now why would I go and do a thing like that? Probably because Blink 182 is a bunch of no-talent prettyboys whose songs all sound the same. I can't begin to comprehend why so many people like them. They're just a bunch of stupid frat-boys who sing about their exes and humping dogs. Even songs that show the slightest bit of potential are ravaged by De Longes grating vocals. The fact that they've recieved so much attention from sell-out programs like MTV and TRL should prove the point I'm trying to make and quell any arguments immediately. So please wake up and buy a real punk album like "London Calling" or "Give 'Em Enough Rope."$LABEL$0

I sent several e-mails to Amazon which went unanswered. Eventually got a refund after several phone calls to PC Universe. Could not get in contact with Amazon at all. The whole thing has been a nightmare. Probably will not order again from Amazon, the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing, etc, etc....ESJ$LABEL$0
they STUNK!!. These were HORRIBLE!!! My daughter was SO DISAPPOINTED!!!The Ad said they were suppose to come from Shindigz. Instead they came from Oriental Trading, whose quality is nothing but horrible lately!! So of course out of 24 cups only 6 went together and STAYED together!!!! We couldn't use them and know I am getting ready to get my money back!!!!! It is a shame that Amazon stated they would come from one company and used the cheaper one. I still got a Great Price, but they couldn't be used. Do NOT order these from Oriental Trading!!! You can get them together, but as soon as you fill them a quarter way and hold them the top comes off, which isn't good since the top is half way down on the cup$LABEL$0

A Star That Shines On. Sarah Brightman has a profoundly beautiful voice, along with wonderful presentation. "Symphony" "Live In Vienna" is breathtaking all the way through.

This particular DVD is going to be a Happy Birthday Gift to my husband as Sarah Brightman has been our favorite for many years.$LABEL$1

The Godfather. I loved this book. I read because a friend said it was a good book. I also read it because, I didn't understand the movie. This book has a lot of detail in it. This a great book, for anyone. But I would have little children read this book, because there is sex and violence. It is about the Corleone flamily. They are a New York Mafia family. It is mostly about the head of this family, Don Vito Corleone. He is dies and his son, Micheal becomes the godfather. The reason they are called 'Godfather' is because they are godfather to different people in there family. The movie were based on this book.$LABEL$1

Funny and sexy with a great paranormal twist!. CALDER'S ROSE is a wonderful and funny contemporary romance with a neat paranormal element. When western writer Shane McNamara is teamed up with romance/western author Devin James, the sparks fly. They have completely different writing styles, and opposing viewpoints on how the two main characters should behave. Shane and Devin are also opposites in real life: Shane is a hunky, `live-it-up' type of a guy who wears T-shirts with wild slogans, and Devin is button-down-shirt conservative, and wears her hair in a tight braid. While Shane rises to the challenge of loosening up his writing partner, the characters of their book, Rose and Calder, realize they're going to have to take matters in hand to get the book written, and they come to life in a unique paranormal twist and a book-within-a-book story. Warm, witty, and sexy, CALDER'S ROSE is a definite keeper.$LABEL$1
Whoever wrote this should be shot. I can't believe FASA would dare to tarnish the BattleTech franchise with this drivel. Ridiculous plot, paper-thin characters. The much-hyped Solaris planet, which could have been such a great plot device is reduced to one remarkably un-astounding battle. Overall, a walking 300-page nightmare.$LABEL$0
James. I bought this item to remove some links from a Tag Heurer watch. While it did work, it did not work well. The pin removers are cast and one broke on the second link i took out. While I was able to resize the watch for me, I doubt I will be able to size another watch without breaking the already bent pin remover. I would not buy this product again. I will be looking for a better quality resizing kit.$LABEL$0
THIS IS A BOOTLEG, DO NOT BUY!!. This is a bootleg!! Do not buy from this person. They are selling illegal recordings. If you want to buy this item the only way to buy it legitimately is from the artist himself. Go to PeterKaukonen.com and purchase this item from his web site. If you do not buy it this way it is a bootleg and therefore illegal to sell and the artist receives no money and criminals like this seller get richer.$LABEL$0
Great buy for the price. I have tried other brands that were designed so they did not match with my ear -- hearing was a challenge at best. Not with the 320. Its unique design assures that it will fit and the speaker placed where you get the best quality sound. Great bargain.$LABEL$1
A place for you. Amongst other things this novel is a love letter to Gloucester, MA, its people, its architecture, its world old and new. It's also about the layering of lives and stories that make up history, the accretions of time and of the imagination. Frank brings a unsettled life with him when he comes to the Gloucester of the 1970s, memories of a dead friend and a failed relationship, and builds something more solid amid the many colourful characters who frequent the restaurants and bars along the waterfront. New friends and loved ones are found and old friends and loves are reassessed. All is not how it seems at first. This is a rich novel and an enjoyable one. Buy it!$LABEL$1
Essential utility. I use this on a Jornada 525, and I must say you really need that if you want to avoid scrapes on you handheld.But it is not so easy to assemble without making fngerprints on the display (I started using gloves for that).

Strewth!. Well I am sorry to do this to you, but let's face it, this is an absolute load of tosh! The woman who's voice could break crystal has finally sold out to the big buck once and for all! This is easily one of the worst albums I have ever heard and a complete waste of my hard earned cash! I only gave it 1 star because there's no option to give it none. I have a lot of Streisand CD's in my collection and a number of vinyl albums from the good old days, but I think this wil be the last...I'll concentrate on the old stuff and singers who are still capable of keeping up with the times, like Diana Ross etc. Sorry Babs...not good enough!$LABEL$0
The Doors go unquestioned. A lot of songs on this album you will love immediately if you are a Doors fan like "Waiting for the Sun" and "Roadhouse Blues" "Queen of the Highway" and "Maggie McGill" with it's satisfying crescendo chorus. "Peace Frog" is another undeniable rock n roll song underlined with Morrison's dark poetry. If I happened to be a desert loner and I had an old car with an 8 track player I would bring this album with me as I drove across the country. That sounds odd but I think you will understand if you listen to this album.$LABEL$1
Ancient Roman history at it's very best! Fascinating!!!!. What a majestic find after 1900 years. It was predicted to Claudius that something of value that he wrote would be hidden and then found 1900 years later. What has been found is the fascinating history of a family who's end was to rule the Roman Empire. Robert Graves has done a wonderful job of putting this manuscript together. He does it in a way that has the reader re-living history "up close and personal." I can't get enough of it.$LABEL$1

Comes in handy all the time!. I bought two of these quite awhile ago... one for my sister and one for myself. I bought it as more of a novelty item than a real tool, but I must say, I use it all the time! My son always wants the tags / strings taken off of shoes, clothes, toys, etc. the moment we pay at the counter... out come the scissors! I look in the rear view mirror and realize I've missed a hair when plucking my eyebrows... out come the tweezers. The fingernail file goes without saying. And, no lie, I was just at the zoo with my son and the zookeeper was putting a bale of hay out for the goats and forgot his knife, so I handed mine through the fence! I'd be lost without this kit!$LABEL$1
Too silly to finish. Although the thought of time traveling to another century to find a the man of your dreams seems appealing, the story was so utterly unbelievable, it spoiled a perfectly good plot! I couldn't finish this book and I always finish what I start. Try reading Diana Gabaldon's "Outlander" series for a really believable but unbelievably intoxicating experience!$LABEL$0

Lomo Super Sampler. This 4 imageLomo camera is a lot of fun. Four images lined up together on one negative make an interesting format. The 'look' of the camera made many people think I was pointing a squirt gun at them! The speed choices are nice but I found myself using only the longer speed. Of course, it is frustrating not to have a real view finderbut simply aiming the camera made for some intersting shots. Personally, I wish the images were divided along the horizontal plane (panoramic) rather than the vertical plane. ....The film advance system and the exposure of each individual lens is inconsistent. In my camera the first image is underexposed by about a 1/2 of a stop and I believe that the film advance gears have already broken contributing to the advance problem. (I have only had the camera for one month.) Overall I would say this is a very expensive plastic toy that does not work well. I like the images but wish the camera worked consistently.$LABEL$0

Back Off Brake Light Signal. I began riding a motorcycle again after an absence of 30 years. As I aged, I became far more cautious and safety minded.

Love, love, love!. This was a great buy. The product trays are STURDY, which is hard to tell from the photos. I have not used the juice part of it yet, but I could see the nozzle getting clogged. Comes with great instructions, shredded paper and coconut shreds to help you get started, and has handy reminders of worm care on the lid. I have it in my kitchen and the only time there are odors are when I open the lid to add food. I got my worms from Uncle Jim's, and after a month in this tray, with food, they look as happy and healthy as can be. Looking forward to my first compost harvest!$LABEL$1
So Kawaii!. Wow! This has to be the best of Kawai's books thus far. I can't stop reading it! It's amusing how Hamtaro is so hopelessly in love with his owner throughout the book. It's not based on the Hamtaro we know from the TV show, but this book is so much better than any one episode from that series. I'm not sure you can say this book is just for kids either. And if you got either of the previous two hamtaro books, and found them to be somewhat of a bore, you'll find this book to be much more enthralling, especially if you're an older reader like me. ^_^$LABEL$1
BIG MISTAKE. All i can say is that if i could have given this movie zero stars i would have. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Any fans of the tv series should feel the same. I pray that they don't decide to do books 2 and 3. jeez, it hurts just to think about how suckish this movie was.$LABEL$0

Work as advertised and provide a very nice seat cushion as well. My wife and I were surprised the first time we used these. We took them to a nearby beach which can be cold with the wind coming in off the ocean. Not only did the Lava Buns keep us warmer the gel actually provided a more comfortable seat which was an unexpected bonus.They are not difficult to use, removing the gel pack and placing it into a microwave for heating and then putting it back into the cloth pouches. I use a dish towel and it is enough to deal with the heat when pulling them out of the microwave oven.Good quality construction so they can be expected to be used for many years.$LABEL$1

Magical Christmas Story. This film magically captures the essence of Christmas. Set in Finland's stunning Lapland, the scenery adds to the power of the story.

Not convinced.... The Author negates most of his premise by starting off saying that Danes are the happiest people on earth. Denmark is very socialist, has incredibly high taxes, and is also very secular. Only 5% of Danes regularly attend Church compared to 43% of Americans.The author's conclusion based on his statistical analysis is that religion and conservatism are the means to a happier nation.It seems like he cherry picks his data to support his conclusion. His analysis is often speculative and surprise surprise, his speculation always supports conservatism and religiosity.It's an interesting read non the less, which is why I gave it two stars. If you are conservative, you'll love how he backs up your beliefs. If you're liberal, you'll leave unconvinced and questioning his methodology.$LABEL$0
Short on time AND flavor. I couldn't believe that the other reviews for this book were so positive. Minutemeals is a good book for those who are only looking to top frozen meals and canned soup, not for people who truly enjoy cooking. I tried the manicotti and the chicken chasseur. They were unpleasant and REALLY tasted like they took 20 minutes to make. I pretty much gave up on the book after that. Why not spend a little more time and cook something with some real depth and flavor?This is also a very bad choice for anyone on a budget. 20 minutes comes at a cost: the recipes call for all sorts of pre-made items ("dessert included" often translates into "buy a pre-made cake")Not exactly a celebration of good, fresh food. And I'm a college student with a budding interest in cooking, no Julia Childs. Invest in quality of life, not this book. I wish I had.$LABEL$0
Translating The Name Is A Must. There is no question that Saosin is the best thing to happen to Hardcore Emo in a very long time.

Saosin is how Hardcode Emo is supposed to sound.$LABEL$1
Don't Go Under The Bed. Electrolux EL5020A Intensity Upright Vacuum CleanerYeah, that's right, this vacuum may have good suction, but if you were thinking it'd fit under a bed to gather up those dustbunnies, just because the handle will flatten down to the floor, YOU WERE WRONG. The unit's main vacuumhead sits too tall to allow it passage under anything but the tallest of beds. I mean, the carry handle's nice and all, but it also raises its profile too much to be of much use universally. Got it for a good price though, woo-hoo! Dumb.$LABEL$0

Aesthetically pleasing, but no good for iPad. I was looking for something that would bundle up all of my USB needs, but also have enough power for my iPad.If it weren't for my need for iPad power, I would definitely give this guy 5 stars.But, I plugged this in via power support + USB, and still not enough power.The spec indicates USB 1.1 or 2.0, but does not specify the power (Amp, Watt, Volt)Honestly, at this point, I have no use for this thing any more... nonetheless, it is a great product for those that know what they want and aren't in need of something for the iPad or a power-sucking tablet of the like.I won't be returning it since there's nothing wrong with it and I'm sure I'll be able to find some use for it in the future...$LABEL$1

So good that it's GREAT!. My predecessors in this review-line have said it all quite well. Suffice it for me to add that I was expecting "so bad that it's good," a la Shatner's "Rocket Man," "Mr. Tambourine Man," & "Lucy in the Sky"...but found this new record to be beautifully conceived, written, performed, and produced. It's moving; it's funny; it's insightful -- & it makes me feel as if I know Bill, & as if he's more "Real" than most NON-celebs I know. Dare I say it? Yes, I do: masterpiece.$LABEL$1
Good game, even on older PC. I won't comment much on how much fun the game is (lots), but I wanted to note that this is one of the few games that will install and run on a machine with less video memory than "required". My 8MB laptop machine came up with a note that it was defaulting to software emulation and reducing video settings. The picture isn't high resolution, but it plays fast and smooth. The picture is still clear enough to play. Thank you EA for allowing those of us with lower end systems to still play games!$LABEL$1
I don't think so. Well I checked this out on several sources before thinking about buying it. I went to a friends home and saw that she had it so I took a hands on tour. This is the biggest waste of money I've seen so far by Maxis. I personally download alot of content off fansites that are 100% better than the offerings in this "edition". I've even dabbled in making my own objects,recolors, etc for the game. I think this should have been included with one of the other packs instead of a stand alone, or at least offered fro free at the official site. I've been playing sims since the very first pc game came out and this is a disappointment for us long time gamers.$LABEL$0

Real rock and roll is not dead. I have a CD collection of over 2,000 discs, and if the house caught fire and I had to grab ten and run...this would be one of them. I'm really sorry I missed seeing them live because they must rip as a live band. Great songs with clever and original arrangements, snappy hooks and musical twists, a super-tight band, and a style that steals from everyone and turns it into something new and yet familiar.True originals, but think early REM, Zevon, Led Zep...with a touch of Nirvana, George Thorogood...sounds crazy but....Take and chance and listen.$LABEL$1
A Pianist with a Passion. The talent and skill of John Rusnak is what every piano student should strive to attain. John Rusnak is a musician with technical skills, a great depth of musicality, and a passion for the classical. He is genius; he is true to the composed work, all the while losing himself within it. It is a blessing to hear him. This is a great album within a really great album cover! :) A perfect gift for anyone who has a love for piano performance, classical music, Chopin, perfection, or passion...!$LABEL$1
Excellent Lunch Box!. I purchased this for my husband who works in very warm conditions, construction related. I've been packing the lower portion of the bag with his lunch items (roomy enough for 2 large containers of most any meal size, several of the moderate sized ones). I place a 12 oz gatorade bottle of frozen water in the bottom, which if not drank, still comes home at the end of 12 hours with ice in. Dual purposer here, to keep cold items cold and provide a cool drink later in the day. In the upper half I put in two 32 oz bottles of gatorade (chilled) he claims they stay fairly cool all day, along with a napkin and utensils. The lunch box is very attractive and looks more like a portable tool kit rather than a lunch bag. By far the best lunch box he has ever had! I highly recommend this item!$LABEL$1
Boring compilation. Most arrangements are oversimlified and repetitive. Stellar songs are reduced to bland, uninviting arrangements. Its a pretty disheartening collection. Its well worth the trouble of trying to arrange them yourself.This compilation is boring and dull. Not worth the money!$LABEL$0
Don't spend extra!. One star isn't for the soundtrack itself, it's for the quality of the packaging. I was hoping that by buying a re-mastered import I'd get a little something in the liner notes. There ARE no liner notes, no lyrics, just a single sheet of flimsy paper with the song titles on it. Buy the domestic; even if it's the same stuff it's nearly 10 bucks cheaper.$LABEL$0
A great read from an original "Cyberpunk". Even if you're not a big fan of David "Cyber" Galbraith, it's still a fascinating rare glimpse of this virtual pioneer's ideas in the formative phase. Sure to be quite collectable in the years to come.$LABEL$1
Nice sound, as expected. The I-Pod sounds a lot better when connected to the receiver than my laptop computer did. Construction and cables are also good quality.Only one minor item merits some attention from the manufacturer: This device would be a lot more practical if the remote control could operate it just like it does a regular CD player, I did not find it very practical to navigate the large collection I have with the available commands. It owrks, but could be a lot better. All the buttons are there, only a few lines of programming would be required. This would chang my rating to 5 stars.$LABEL$1
Like the band!. I have Mari's initial pilates DVD,and have not used a band with pilates before and felt that it was a good challenge you definitely feel your muscles working. If you are new to pilates I definitely recommend this, however if you are advanced you probably will not get too much of a challenge from this DVD.$LABEL$1
awesome. finnaly the great songs of the best death metal band in the world. I listen to this cd over and over$LABEL$0
Chieko rules, but the movie doesn't. Dangerous Game is the poorest of the Zero Woman series, ironic as the gorgeous Chieko Shiratori is probably the best actress to portray the Japanese hit woman. Almost literally nothing happens in this movie, as it's also the most chatty of the series. Still, Chieko takes off her clothes and that's always worth the price of admission.$LABEL$0
Not worth the $ - Auto Car Ventilator. I have been very disappointed with the performance of the Auto car ventilator. The Auto Car Ventilator just stops working for no reason but if you roll down your window a little it will start back up. It hasn't seemed to have made a difference in the temperature in the car and was a waste of money.$LABEL$0
Nice TShirt!. My son is a huge Peyton Manning fan and he was so pleased to receive this shirt. I had to send it back to get a different size and the supplier was terrific. They sent me the right size quickly and without a hassle. Good product and supplier.$LABEL$1

Phenomenal bumper!!. Absolutely perfect fit for my 1994 Chevy Silverado. Every nut, bolt, screw, bracket, light, etc. included! A VERY pleasant surprise!$LABEL$1
Hardest Working Band in Austin, Texas. I have seen the Hudsons on a number of occassions in Austin. They are entertaining, have a great sense of humor and are very talented. The are high energy, yet accoustic. The songs they have composed are both witty and tender. Phoebe, the violinist, adds an eclectic element to the band. I am dissappointed that she was absent from the last performance I attended. I had a greater appreciation for the CD after I saw them perform. Great show, very entertaining.$LABEL$1
Severely disappointed. I'm both a collector and a bibliophile, and this is the first time I've ever thought it necessary to this say about any collector's book: In my opinion, this book stinks. A shame, as it's clear that the author has in-depth knowledge to impart. Unfortunately, it's clouded by the author's apparent dislike of dealers, fellow collectors, and the Homer Laughlin China Company itself.The book designer's work is exuberant and cheerful, much as is Fiestaware; however, the author's text is mean spirited. I don't think I've ever seen an odder combination. I hope for better things from the obviously knowledgeable author in the future.$LABEL$0
The mooninites are taking over my PSP!. Aqua Teen on the Go can only mean one thing. Having the person next to you think you're crazy for watching a cartoon about happy meal items. Nothing cooler than freaking out the squares! It's worth the extra cash for the supberb quality and to scare the normals.$LABEL$1
These leave the baby way sticky. While being put forward as more environmentally friendly, we found these wipes to be not up to par. they always seem to leave the baby sticky and not really clean feeling. Will not be buying these again.$LABEL$0
Beware! Older edition of the book!!!. I bought this for my daughter for a class because Amazon had it linked to the hardcover of the same name. Small problem, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME BOOK. Only the first few chapters are the same. CHECK THE EDITION NUMBER AND PUBLICATION DATE your professor wants before you buy this older edition of the book.$LABEL$0
rats go in for dinner-eat bait-NO ZAP!. I followed the instructions to "A Tee". The bait kept disappearing but no dead mice. I tried another set of new batteries with no luck. The only this that this thing zapped was 45 bucks out of my wallet. I ask my local terminex guy about these and he said that even if they worked. Once you get the smell of dead rodent, rats won't dare enter again. Better off using a classic rat trap/bait stations etc. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I might recommend it to a rat because it appears to be pretty safe for them.$LABEL$0
Ten Minutes Tops. After spinal surgery I started wearing sturdy shoes. Since I have wide toes and a narrow arch and heel, I thought these gel mats might help with heel comfort. However, after just a few minutes one of the heel mats slid sideways and was very uncomfortable. This "one-size-fits-all" did not fit in my shoes.$LABEL$0
Grant-Writing book recommendation. This book is very well-organized, presenting the information in a step-by-step manner that makes it manageable for neophyte would-be grant-writers. I have no doubt that it will serve me well as a continuing resource even as I gain skills and experience.$LABEL$1
So So, not all that exciting!. It may have 4,000 fonts but alot of them are basically different versions of the same font. A little skinnier, a little fatter, bold, italics etc etc. Some fonts literally have dozens of different styles, yet it's still the same font. It doesn't take long to add up to 4,000 when you do that. If your looking for fun, funky, cool fonts, don't get this, they aren't on here. OK, that's a lie, there aren't very many. It all depends on your tastes. There are alot of good fonts on here, and it's well worth the price to have them all in one place. Sure beats downloading them all individually, but don't think that you're going to get 4,000 DIFFERENT fonts, not here.$LABEL$0
Wow. lIKED THE product. Had seen this for around 30 bucks online without shipping in the T-mobile site..but here all i had to spend was around 8 bucks...and the battery looks geniune and works fine.Thanks$LABEL$1
The Bears provide the solution again. When my daughter was young, she froze when she had to recite lines in pre-school or at church. I bought The Berenstain Bears Get Stage Fright to read to her. It proved to be just what she needed. She went on to give talks in church, reports in school, and even excelled in a drama group for several years.$LABEL$1
Harowing tale. This is a compelling story about real people doing what most wouldn't think of doing. It's infuriating that the captain of the freighter was so thoughtless. If he had been anything but a complete waste of time, Can Do would still be here. Read this book carefully and learn what is happening out there. The media ignores fishing and the ocean unless something bad happens. Your life is affected by the ocean and you should know how.$LABEL$1
MIU deep,fryer. The perfect deep fry utensil. Minimal spatter and excellent heat control (on a gas stove).I have sent my electric deep fryer to Goodwill.$LABEL$1
Reads like a mental health textbook. Why is romance and entertainment built on such a sad topic as alcoholism? LUCY IS GETTING MARRIED is the kind of book that begs for an answer to this quetion.It's no secret that a deep hopelessness and despair is what every alcoholic suffers. The drunk state gives some degree of relief from the pain of facing reality and other emotional conflicts. It's a kind of sedative. Lucy needs a sedative at times, thus gets drunk herself. Probably too often. Lucy at age 17 had clinical depression. Is this really the stuff that romantic comedy is made of?This book is interesting to read but not as comedy - it's too sad for that.$LABEL$1
"I e-mail like a Baroness?". The disc was mediocre up to this line, then the bottom fell out. I am fan of Queen, that's the only reason this get's more than one star. The music is awkwardly shoe-horned into the story, with some lyrics re-written to fit better (ie "Radio Ga-Ga" and the already mentioned butchering of the classic "Killer Queen"). The vocal talents are good but sound... off with this material. While any Queen is better than no Queen sometimes it's better to leave well enough alone.$LABEL$0
Great knife at a great price. I purchased this knife due to a rating in one of my cookbooks. I received the knife, and to my surprise, it was remarkably sharp. It holds its edge well, and once it does dull up, sharpens easily. I have not had any issues with rusting, but I hand wash it and don't let if sit in the sink for days at a time. I'm very happy with this knife and now wish I would have purchased the whole set right away.$LABEL$1
Good quality but ink dries fast. As I said. Excellent quality, good variety of colors. Good to write on CDs and everywhere else. What I thought is a problem is that I have them for less than a couple of years, with little use, and most of them are drying out.$LABEL$1
almost silly. As a long time Taiji student/teacher I can vouch for the solid principles and concepts presented.However, the author's constant attempt to construct his prose in a magical, mystical package was almost too silly to read.he seemed kind of full of himself, as if he was the focus with his esoteric poetic sentence structure.It's worth getting just to enjoy his attemot to be deep, dark and authoritative.$LABEL$0
Amount Was Not as Described. When I placed the order, the description said it came as 20 plates per package. I placed an order of 3, but I only received 3 plates when I expected 60. I didn't realize that until I went back to review the original product description.$LABEL$0
Great sound; Wrong Indexing. I give it 4 stars because it isn't too mixed up with the indexing and the most important part is the excellent sound...all for the low price! There are even 3 bonus birds at the end (but, no names!) I don't understand the person who says the indexing is not wrong. If you select a track and it isn't the bird then the indexing is wrong. Simple. Don't get it if you must have the indexing correct. And I think it is a great buy. No regrets! I'm getting more as gifts. I'll get the list straight. It will definitely help me learn the names!$LABEL$1
Pleased with selection. The ordering processing was excellent and I received it without any problems. The DVD that was ordered was in great condition and had no problems. Will definitely order again.$LABEL$1
Do not buy !. JUNK! My mic doesn't work at all. The other reviewer is the only person that i've heard of that it actually works. I've read alot about other gamers casque mics not working either. Do not buy! Save your money. It also doesn't tell you, you need the psp remote that comes with the more expensive psp box. So i wasted 40 bucks on nothing!$LABEL$0
CORDLESS BUT ALSO LIGHTLESS. NICE PHONES, BUT IF YOU ARE IN A DARK ROOM GOOD LUCK WITH TH BUTTONS. NO LIGHTS BACK LIGHTING THEM.$LABEL$1
Good Item. Own a skating rink and have used this cd player before. Keep and use 2 at all times. Have used another brand and replaced it twice in the time I've used this one once. Getting another one of these so I have 2. Love the ease of use of the round knob to select songs instead of a button, much quicker and easier. Would purchase this one again if I have to.$LABEL$1
Don't Believe the Back Cover. I like some others thought this book would be different from the discription on the back cover. This book was very disturbing. I am afraid to say that I did not finish it. My time is so precious and there are so many other books to read. If you choose to read be aware that it is very violent. I would not only not recommend it but warn you against it.$LABEL$0
Very basic. This book has a couple of novel ideas for things that could be made with PVC but they are so basic that anyone who is the least bit handy around the house/shop could make them without the book. The only plus is that, if you did want to build one of these projects, the book gives a materials list and the measurement so you dont have to figure that stuff out yourself.Had it been from a local store I would have returned it, but it isnt worth the shipping to send it back to Amazon.$LABEL$0
Keeps on Ticking. This is a replacement for a Timex purchased several years ago. My husband loves this watch and was very happy to have another. The style is simple, casual or dress and he prefers it to his Cartier...love the Indiglo feature.$LABEL$1
I Had To Give Up On This Book And Made It Part Of All My Yesterdays!. I usually like Parker's books,and particularly when he deviates from his Spenser books. So, I really was expecting to enjoy All Our Yesterdays, probably Parker's most significant departure from his 'norm" However, much to my disappointment, I found this book to be have erratic pacing, slow to develop, and not very believable or interesting characters. As such, I wound up skimming through large passages and then, ultimately, giving up on it. There are just too many books and not enough time to waste time reading All Our Yesterdays.$LABEL$0
So Far So Good. OK, I completed the IGNITE portion of this series with Emily and boy do I break a sweat. The 3rd Cardio & Sculpt DVD is basically part of the IGNITE CALORIE BURN DVD, so when I get to the ACCELERATE with Rebekah, I'll know what to expect.$LABEL$1
Coming back to buy more!!. My Boxer is so finicky buy she LOVES her Zuke's!!! I've taught her so many tricks with these treats, Thanx!$LABEL$1
The river two? yes please!. This Carcassonne expansion is a must have for Carcassonne lovers. The river adds alot of esthetic value to the game and has a few special perks like a pig farm tile and a volcano and the city segments are sweet. I definately reccommend it!$LABEL$1
Harvesting the Heart speaks to my heart!. Harvesting the Heart is the third book I have read by Jodi Piquolt. Each time, I am amazed by her sense of reality. She often addreses the simple truths which so many people are afraid to speak. Harvesting the Heart is no exception. The main character, Paige, has a little peice of all of us in her. With amazing clarity, we watch and relate as Paige faces the difficulties and triumphs in her life. This book is not to be missed! I am so sad I finished it....When is the next book due out by Jodi Piqoult??$LABEL$1
Very Functional. This book has great insight into what it takes to be a creative author. My only complaint is the content of some of the sample stories. I realize they are very well written and serve the intended purpose. However, when limited pieces of suspense and crime stories are included it leaves the readers (who are simply trying to to get an education) with a terrible feeling in the pit of their stomach.$LABEL$1
Not as Shown on the Box. I got this and am really not too thrilled. Let's look at my list of gripes:1. What you actually GET is NOT what is shown in this illustration or even on the box. This tool does NOT come with the pictured tool holder that provides additional stabilization and support. Even though the holder is CLEARLY shown and there is an insert about it in the box, it ain't there.Without the holder, your Dremel is ponly attached to the "table" with a a collar at the top of the tool that is secured with e hex nut. This leaves the body of the tool unsupported and that much linear mass makes for easy deflection when working harder woods.2. Once you have mounted the "table" to a support surface correctly mounting the tool into the holder is a real challenge (I guess I have big fingers)3. The precision of the fence and depth adjustments is really hit or miss as most of the assenbly is plastic.Overall I give it a 2 -- mostly for false inducement.$LABEL$0
Decent quality. The product itself is decent quality as expected from Suncoast. However, there is no way to lock the top so the wind won't blow it open on the dock. This is a major flaw by the manufacturer.$LABEL$0

What a boring sounding record!. Every song sounds EXACTLY the same-Steely Dan sure has gone downhill over the years. Don't touch this new release with a 10 foot pole!$LABEL$0
Julie and Julia 365 days 524 recipes.....NOT so Great!. Can I give this a Zero star? I thought it was going to be a light hearted book about cooking and blogging. It was dark and I think some things were meant to be witty but fell short. NOW there is a Movie about this book and I can honestly say that I hope that the movie is better than this book. It had lots of mistakes and then it seemed to me that the author was all over the place. Sometimes you just sort of want to throw the book at the wall or then you just sit there and think WOW she actually got a book deal and a movie deal out this. ONLY in AMERICA! Thumbs down and a zero star. Why did I really buy this book? I got it on clearance for 1.99 and the cover looked great and the back of the book really lead me to beleive that this was going to be a very intresting read. AGAIN NOT the case!$LABEL$0
Doesn't do the job. I was disappointed with this product. It did nothing to make eye shadow last longer - there are other products out there that do a better job. Previously I used Vital Radiance but it has been discontinued - that was the best primer I have ever used at a reasonable price.$LABEL$0
Not as good as I expected. The individual trays are too small to use for any significant amount of food. The frame is cheap and flimsy. It does heat well though.$LABEL$0
Don't waste your money. This product never worked. I mean NEVER worked. I have a Pentium 3 450 Dell system, and I follwed all the directions given, but the product was never able to be opened. I tried to contact the manufacturer and not only was no one able to help me, I was not able to return the product because it is software and you could, potentially, copy it once it is opened. Perhaps this product would work on your system, but why chance it? Save your money and buy a product from a more reputable company with good customer service.$LABEL$0
Wilco emperor clothes. Am i missing something here? All i'm hearing is a bunch of bland country pop songs with a peppering of ambient electronica over the top. The only song that's remotely interesting is the first one "I'm trying to break your heart". The rest of it is very light and muddled. I could just imagine how unbeleivably dull Wilco would be live.$LABEL$0

I thought I was lost until I found this book.... For years now I've been beating myself up because I never seemed happy. The more money I made and the worse I felt and I didn't know why. UNTIL, I read this book... I can't put enough words down to tell you how much this book has done for me. I hope it puts you on the right road just like it has for me. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.$LABEL$1
I am so glad I got this book at the library! SKIP IT. This book had a good premise that soon went bad .it is bloated and gets to over 500 pages with boring filler.I found Wes to be whiny and frankly his character drove me nuts. His self pity and lack of action got very tedious.It can get back to the library fast enough.$LABEL$0
quite happy with it. I've owned a lot of insulated bottles. This is my favorite, for sure. It has a very solid feel. The rubberized grip is a nice touch. I loaded it with green tea, and five hours later the temperature seemed just the same as when I put it in.The slightly larger size is a plus. It allows you to put in two full cups without worrying about spilling, and your drink is not in contact with the plastic stopper for hours.Definitely better than my previous system of using an old juice bottle and reheating in a microwave.It seems like a bit of money for something like this, but the cost will soon be forgotten while the quality will be enjoyed for a long time to come.$LABEL$1
Don't bother if you don't have a GeForce4 or better.. I played the demo before the game released and the framerate .... on my GeForce2. Then I finally picked it up because of all the hype and it still ..... UT2003, RTCW and Enemy Territory run super smooth on my system with the res to 1024x768. And from what I've seen they're more fun. And how can you have a WWII FPS with no blood? I don't know how this POS got game of the year. It's not all that. Pick up Wolfenstein or download enemy territory for the best WWII sim experience.$LABEL$0
From Salvador Agron to making us groan. I'm another of those who has enjoyed Paul Simon's work for a long time, so I was anxious to hear this latest CD. After making myself listen to it several times, all I can say is "Huh?". These songs range from OK (That's where I belong, Senorita, Old) to bad (Lorraine, Pigs Sheep & Wolves) to incomprehensible (the Teacher) to unlistenable (Quiet). The only positive thing I can find here is some of the instumental work is nice. But, those lyrics! I'd much rather hear about the Girl from New York City who calls herself a human trampoline than the frog in South America whose venom is an antidote for pain. (Hey, did I just make a rhyme there?) I hope this isn't Paul Simon's last album, as it would be a poor coda to an otherwise great body of work. I give this CD one star because of the music, with the second awarded as a sentimental one because it's by Paul Simon.$LABEL$0
My 12 year old niece Loves these books!. My 12yr old niece loves these books and her 10 year old sister seems to like them too. Beautiful pictures.$LABEL$1
Mostly disappointing. I guess it had to end this way. The original radio version of "Hitchhiker" was the high-water mark. The television version wasn't as good. The books have gotten worse and worse. There really weren't many jokes here and the miserable ending was so totally lacking in imagination that I was really angry at myself for having read this book. It's as if Mr. Adams was tired of the story and characters but not the revenue stream.$LABEL$0
Six months later, and it's dead. I've always loved the taste of a fresh-brewed cup of coffee from a Farberware percolator. Over the past few years, I've felt they died prematurely, but nothing like this! I ordered one from Amazon in March. Went to make coffee this morning, everything sounded as it should, went to pour a cup - HOT WATER. Rusty-looking hot water.I had come to accept that these pots don't live long, but six months???? Ridiculous.$LABEL$0
Not what I expected. I have only ever seen this book with 10.8 x 9.6 x 0.4 inch dimensions. That is what I expected when I ordered the book. I never saw the dimensions listed, but the book delivered to me had dimension of 4.9 x 5.8 x 0.6 inches --half the size. It may have been my fault, but I do not remember seeing those dimensions when I ordered the book. Just something to be aware of.$LABEL$0
Not what I thought. This book is ok because it has a few tasty sounding recipes, but I thought it would be more in depth on specific sprouts and sprouting techniques. I read the entire book in a couple of hours and I am not a fast reader. I wish I would have just checked it out at the library. The book is mostly about the authors dietary beliefs in which I do not follow. Pretty much a useless book for me. Maybe if you are a raw foodist and are looking to eat sprouts for most or all of your calories this would be a good book for you. I wanted more info than this book provided.$LABEL$0
Does not work with Powerbook Wallstreet G3. Despite the specifications listed by Amazon, this card will not work with Mac Powerbook G3 before lombar and pismo and computers running less than Panther Mac OSX 10.3. This includes much of the Powerbook G3 line. I contacted Sonnet and they confirmed that the Amazon information is incorrect. I have used other Sonnet products with good results and I think that this is a misunderstanding on Amazon's part. The Sonnet tech people said that they would contact Amazon to correct this issue.$LABEL$0

Not what it's supposed to be!!!. This is supposed to be a corkscrew made by Screwpull. It says so in the heading: "by Screwpull".I purchased this as a wedding gift for $27.99 instead of the lower-priced Le Creuset-branded corkscrews because my 15 year-old Screwpull is still functioning perfectly and I wanted to give the bride and groom a corkscrew that would last.The package just arrived and, instead of saying SCREWPULL, as is shown in the item description, it is branded LE CREUSET.It is decidedly shoddier in construction and has an AWFUL, serrated foil-cutting knife that doesn't even open fully as the one on the Screwpull does.To make matters worse, in the week that has elapsed since I ordered it, the price has dropped five dollars. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!I'm sending it back.$LABEL$0
damaged. I bought three copies to give as presents. Therefore, it did matter that two of the copies had small damages that disqualified them. I have to find something else on short "notice". So, while the book is full of humor and much fun, I wish they knew what people who buy a NEW book expect.$LABEL$1
corrina,corrina: THE BEST, THE BEST !. Am now working on my 4th viewing of this superbly written and acted version of life as it truely was in the 1950's. SO many issues brought to the viewer in a smart, funny, thought-provoking package that pulls at your heart strings again and again. Just another chance to see Percy and "Lois" may make me view it a 5th time! The cast and director have produced a classic.$LABEL$1
Great Entertainment!. This is one of the best series that has ever been on television. It is not only historically correct, it looks authentic. The sets, costumes, hairstyles and makeup give you the feeling that you are back in the 1940s. The extras on the CDs are an informative addition.$LABEL$1
Gory horror. It's really my fault that I haven't done more research before deciding to read this book right after the Book of Lost Things. They are very different. The Book of Lost Things is a gentle, dark yet hopeful and touching retelling of old fairytales interposed onto a boy's life. Nocturnes is a series of gory, gutty, gritty horror tales. It may be your thing but it definitely isn't mine. I confess I didn't finish the book but the first three stories turned me off completely. The Cancer Cowboy Rides seemed an attempt at copying works by H.G. Wells and Stephen King. Cancer is a horrible thing and I don't need a story to horrify me about it even further without a positive redemption.$LABEL$0
Faithful To The End. Faith Evan's new album 'Faithfully', is truly as work of art. Tracks like 'Burning Up' and 'Where we Stand' are beautiful. This album is Faith's best project to this point.Most of the sounds are catchy and the lyrics are extremely meaningful. If that wasn't all u could ask for, the interludes are the bomb. 'Faithful' interlude and 'Everything' interlude best the best of them.Faith is a very talented singer, one who has kept up her standards up unlike so many of the singers of today.$LABEL$1
Great Experience. This was the first movie that I watched that focused on a same sex lifestyle. I really enjoyed it.$LABEL$1
Excellent Pocket Size Traveler. I also was in the region as a earlier poster puts it. With this Croatian or Hrvatski dictionary if you please. Firstly this Croatian dictionary is not favored to Serbian, this is blatantly untrue. As well as the fact that the official script/text for Serbian is Cyrillic. The earlier given example of bread as sensitive, which I checked in this Croatian dictionary, clearly shows the word "Kruh" ,which is the correct Croatian word for bread. In regards to lacking several words and explanation of others, I also suspect this to be untrue, because the earlier poster would be able to provide specific examples and clearly failed to provide evidence of this. I found this Croatian dictionary extremely thorough for its handy pocket size with over 30,000 entries.$LABEL$1
Excellent CD..... I'm a huge Guster fan, and I have to agree with one of the earlier reviews, "Parachute" isn't Guster's best effort at an album. The last song, "Parachute" is the best on the CD, with the most depth and passion, which is why I love Guster so much. I have all of the Guster CDs and would say that "Goldfly" is by far the best. But get them all, and I promise you that you will love them!!$LABEL$1
Junk!!. Beck Children's Wooden High Back Rocking ChairThe assembly is simple but the chair and screws are of poor quality. The first screw I tried broke off in the spindle. I had to put it in a vise to remove the broken piece and replace the screw. The second spindle split when the screw tighten. It only cost $30 but was worth about $5. Not worth the effort to return it but I am sure it won't last long enough for my two year old to out grow it.$LABEL$0
Cutest thing!!. These were the cutest. They were a huge hit at the baby shower with everyone giving stories about events they wished they'd had them for years ago!! Adorable design (the little airplanes) and soft as could be. I would definitely recommend them to others.$LABEL$1
Birds couldn't figure it out.... I bought this feeder offline. For some reason the birds at my place couldn't even figure out how to eat out of this feeder. They would stare at the seeds longingly, sit on the window sill, and peck at the plastic. But I think I only saw one bird sucessfully eat seeds out of it. I had the same handfull of seeds in there for weeks until I just gave up and took it down.I don't think it's that my birds were too big to land on the edge. They were mostly just sparrows. Maybe it was that they couldn't really notice the clear plastic.$LABEL$0
Do the Math. I used this CD to learn new concepts in my math classes. It is one of the few products which covers math concepts for 5th -8th grade. The kids loved it. Even though they like to act older, they are still children and they are motivated through music.$LABEL$1
great photos, semi-beginner to advanced. This book came out before the huge glut, and I still like thumbing through it. The examples are marvelous. While it walks you very well through some projects, others are sort of "on your own." Good for an intermediate or advanced beader who wants to do more improvising, but might be frustrating for a new beader. I recommend learning the basic stitches elsewhere, but get this book, if only for the wonderful photos of work by very talented bead artists. It also has a useful section on balancing color and bead size, more useful information if you're ready to start personalizing your projects. It covers different stringing options well, and provides a good start for wire working. They could have left out the section on polymer clay, though.$LABEL$1
Horrible!. The acting was so off! All the characters we're shallow and lacked development. I feel like they made the movie way too romantic.Right now I'm trying to rewind this movie out of my brain.$LABEL$0
Some Timeless, Some Outdated. Many of the articles (columnist for New York Times) in this book are outdated -- many of the wines are no longer good, the prices have tripled, many of the restaurants are no longer around, etc. However, many of the articles are timeless. They give the same advice that the current experts are giving, but in a more easily read presentation. For that, I would give it five stars, but the outdated articles pull it down to four stars. Worth checking out, especially for avid readers of wine material.$LABEL$1
Dont't Buy this Book. Don't buy this book. Half (160 of 320 pages) is devoted to material on behavior and general characteristics, that is too simplified for a biologist (or veteran birder) and too detailed for some one seeking identification of new species. The identification sections show 7 birds per page, without size or habitat perspective. The illustrations are accurate to the extent of my observations, and range maps are shown on the ID pages. The print is about 6 point, and I simply could not read it in the field. The authors are obviously expert and anxious to please, but this book will not please anyone.$LABEL$0
A Rip-Off. Readers should be aware that this edition of "The World As I See It" is, in fact, an abridged version of the original publication. Without bothering to mention this on the title page, it has dropped the entire fifth section on "Scientific Questions," including such classic popular expositions of Einstein's basic philosophy as "Geometry and Experience" and "Principles of Research." Editing a book of Einstein's writings which deliberately excludes all mention of science is like publishing a biography of Mozart - without any reference to music.It is, I think, significant of the dumbing down of American publishing that the German edition of the same book ("Mein Weltbild," published by Ullman) has continuously added new material on politics, fascism, Judaism, peace and science over the years! Readers who want to know what Einstein was really like should obtain a used copy of the original full version.$LABEL$0
junk. i bought 2 of these from a local store and both stopped working within days. so i went online and bought a third only to experience the same results. the concept is fantastic. they can drop it and fall on it and nothing gets hurt. but the radio inside is, i think, too fragile. i will not try again.$LABEL$0
the more I see it,the better it gets.... The first time I saw this movie I thought that it lacked alot of luster.But after watching it a few times I can honestly say that this is a very good movie with alot of fast action.Rent it first to see how you like it,then buy it.$LABEL$1
Great chairs!. As a Director of an assisted living community, I purchsed 6 of these for our front porch with the Franklin seat cushions. They have been appreciated by everyone - residents, families, and guests alike. They are very good quality that I expect will last for many years. They assembled easily and we will be using them for a third summer this year. The matching side tables are great as well. I am purchasing for my own home. I would liken them to Smith & Hawken quality and I would recommend these to anyone.$LABEL$1

The beat that carries you. To fully enjoy this CD you need a car, as you noticed in the video. The basic rhythm floating through the song is fabulous. It comes, it goes away again, then comes back in the company of a superb vocal. If you're not really into Leftfield, you probably shouldn't buy his 'Rhythm and Stealth' album, but this single really is a must.$LABEL$1
Bourne delivers. I am not much of a movie buff, but my husband and boys really wanted to see the Bourne series, so we watched them all. From the first to the last, all three delivered action, drama, and excitement. I was a little confused (i think that was the point) when the Ultimatum started, but it quickly came together and did not disapoint. There is action/violence in each one so my younger girls who are prone to being scared and night terrors did not watch with us (a good choice).$LABEL$1

Explorer Pro Comp Steering Stabilizer. I own a 1998 Dodge Ram 4x4 1500.The Pro Comp model number I used (224000)was suppost to be a direct replacement ,it wasn't! The hardware package that came with the stabilizer was not even close to working.It was an easy fix though.I burned the metal bushings out of the old stabilizer ,sanded them down (they were a little too big around to fit in the new rubber bushings) and used them in the new stabilizer-so I could reuse the old bolts.The Pro Comp S.S. fix my steering problems ,it works great.$LABEL$1
Amazing 1st album for up and coming group; amazing guitarist. Led Zeppelin has finally found a worthy successor. While Crumb needs some polish, its potential is obvious to any rock and roll listener.

Duplicate Movie. Once again I found this great deal and gift to give to someone special for Christmas. The problem was that one of the movies was duplicated. This is not the first time this has happend to me. It was a real dissapointment to find this discrepancy. The company putting these sets together needs to come up with a better packaging system. It's really upsetting to see this happen so often.$LABEL$1
Only giving this 2 stars for ease of use. This paste gave BOTH my dogs diarrhea each time I used it. It's also got disgusting fillers. The price is WAY too high for how little use you get out of each can. Just buy a large peanut butter or cream cheese or throw left over chicken in the Kong and freeze it. Why pay this if you can get 20x the use out of a jar of peanut butter? I only caved because I had been curious for months AND it went on sale.$LABEL$0
another failure in gothic metal. Don't get me wrong -- I loved all the Sirenia albums. I loved Morten in Tristania (another band that went the same direction as Sirenia on their last release)... but this is POP. It is not metal, it is not even gothic, it's POP. No violins, no Morten doing any vocals at all (and he has a great singing voice, not just his growls). This is reminding me an awful lot of another band that went down this road -- a band called Theatre of Tragedy.If you like the old albums, don't bother buying this one. You can listen to 30 seconds of one song on this album and understand why. That's really all you need, because every song sounds exactly the same.That's all we needed, another failure in gothic metal.$LABEL$0
Sex Is HOLY,Its More About ONENESS Than About ORGASM. Sex IS HOLY. Its for MARRIED persons ONLY. A form of worship to God. He is present when you express your love to your mate. It's about your oneness with God and your love for God. You are loving God like God loves you unconditionally when you obey Him. Sex between a husband and wife is expressing that love. Outside of marriage sex is a sin that seperates you from God. Sin is DEATH. When you love God, you love what God loves and HATES what God Hates. God Hates SIN of any kind. Fornication and adultery is sex outside of the marriage covenant. Both are sins that says I choose to seperate myself from God and DIE.$LABEL$1
You're better off with Sayers alone. Speaking as a person who began reading Sayers' Wimsey books at the age of nine, I found the contributions of Ms. Walsh to be crudely apparent. It does not seem that she understands the characters very well. Regarded on its own, this is a moderately successful book, hence the two stars, but if you are seeking Lord (and Lady) Peter, it is much more rewarding to read any of Sayers' unaided works.$LABEL$0

Braun Activator Replacement Parts. I am glad that Amazon offers convenient access to replacement parts for the Braun 8000-series electric razors. This razor is truly amazing and really does give an amazingly close shave, but once in awhile it is necessary to replace the cutterblock and cleaning solution, and it is great to know that I can order them on Amazon.$LABEL$1
not horrid, yet not awsome. This is adiscrace to Indiana Jones. One of the problems is if you hit someone with a chair they die in one hit yet it takes 8-10 hits to kill someone with a machete. and to add insult to injury it takes 2-4 shot to kill someone with a gun even if you shoot them in the head. LucasArts need to get their prioratys straight, a gun and a machete are more lethal than a chair.$LABEL$0
BIG BAD BOB SPEAKS. This album stinks worse than a diaper full of digested Gurbers strained carrots. I say babies should hear the Beatles at full strength!

Beautiful music, voice, lyrics.... I saw Rachael Yamagata during the 2004 Austin City Limits Music Festival. I had no idea who she was nor did I have any idea about her music. I remember standing in front of her for about 45 minutes enjoying her music.I recently thought back to that day at ACL and looked online for her CDs. I purchased Happenstance and have fallen in love with her music and her voice. I enjoy sitting in my car and listening to this CD. Her voice is so amazing...it's strong and yet it doesn't overpower the music. Her songs cover all the different moods...sad, happy, nonchalant, angry....it's such real music.I recommend this CD to anyone who's sick of mass-produced music and wants something to remind them of how music is supposed to make you feel.I truly enjoyed this CD and am sure that if you're anything like me, you would too. Thank you Rachael for coming up with some great music :)$LABEL$1

Hmm.... This was a great game I must say. I did find it a little too short for my tastes, but it set out on what it was supposed to do. There is a good bit of variety in this shooter that you won't find in most other first person shooting games. On that note, I have to say that it wasn't worth the 60 dollar price tag. You can easily beat this game in less than a week and after you do, your pretty much done. Not much replay value here. It definitely is a great rental though.$LABEL$1
Great tool. It was an awesome help in setting my budget and getting little details out of the way early that I never would have thought about.

To Mac Or Not To Mac. Those of you who are pouting that this is an overprized Mac accessory aren't clearly not Mac people --- and for that reason, you probably don't own an Ipod, either (and another brand's comprable MP3 player).You're either a Mac person or you're not --- Mac people tend to want good performance, good appearance... and they don't care what it costs.From a technical standpoint, this thing works great. I also use it to plug in my USB mini-drives and it's flawless. If you want it and you care about the Mac-image, then don't 2nd guess and buy a knockoff or USB extension cord. There's no such thing as buyer's remorse for Mac addicts...$LABEL$1
Baby likes this chair. We bought this for our baby when she was 2 months. She hated the vibration at first and now tolerates it. Now at 3 months we use it mostly like a play gym. We have 3 large dogs so having an elevated play gym helps. The rattle toy that comes with it is OK. We hang our own toys off the bar using links. She likes the song it plays. We get a lot of use out of it already and I'm glad we will be ablr to continue using it when she is a toddler.$LABEL$1
Hard to digest !!!. It is clearly not a self-study material and one needs to refer to other books, for better understanding. On certain crucial topics, you are left in the dark, to solve the remainder of the problem as an exercise. It might be a great book in a class where the professor will provide you with the required examples and solutions, but I don't think one should take it up as a self-study book.$LABEL$0
Children Sewing Machine do not purchase. My daughter wanted a Sewing Machine for her 8th Birthday. I thought it would be a good introduction to sewing instead of using my adult machine, but it was a mistake because the Singer Lockstitch Sewing Machine only worked once, when we first tried and this was it. I tried to work on it but it is so cheaply made that no wonder it doesn't work more than once. Unfortunatelly by the time we realize, I could not return it, because the box was in the garbagge.It is just a big waste of money. Don't buy it.$LABEL$0
Traditional film in a day of transitory digital images. An excellent medium/high speed B&W film for those who still appreciate traditional photography at a time that so many have become accustomed to the instant gratification of the sub-standard images offered up by the menagerie of digital cameras. Hopefully Ilford and their cohorts will be around for a long time to come producing film for those of us who have not been corrupted by megapixels and raw images saved in cyberspace.$LABEL$1
Astro Boy - The Complete Series. "Astro Boy - The Complete Series" is the best Japanese color anime treatment of Astro Boy, based on the work of the legendary manga and anime artist, Osamu Tezuka. Tezuka's work in manga and anime is unparalleld and stands alone in style and substance in this graphic Japanese genre. He is without peer in the entire ouvre of his work, especially with "Astro Boy - The Complete Series." He is in a class of his own. This is why he richly deserves the subriquette "The Walt Disney of Japan." I would heartily recommend "Astro Boy - The Complete Series" and all other works of Tezuka's which he produced over his illustrious lifetime.$LABEL$1
Explanations are weak!. This book is written from the following point of view: You have alredy been exposed to PDEs in the past, used a different and better book, and are now refreshing your knowledge. Strauss "concisely" and quickly moves through topics and simply highlights the obvious stuff you should have learned. Strauss is a good reference book for quick review, but not especially good for those adverse to equation reading rather than words.$LABEL$0
DU is a bridge to understanding ACIM. I have been studying A Course in Miracles for about 30 years and never fully understood it. One reading of DU opened my understanding.

Disappointed fan. i'm a big fan of augusten burroughs but i can hardly get through this book. it's just not really all that funny - certainly not as clever as his fans would expect. the stories seem really random and forced - almost as if he was ordered by his publisher to crank out another winner but he just didn't really feel like it. he lost his edge on this one. hope he gets it back. he's no sedaris on this one.$LABEL$0

Driver fans will love DRIV3R !. ....that is, IF you are able to understand that different games are DIFFERENT GAMES. Ive been a long time fan of the driver series and the gta series & love both, but all of these reviews comparing it to gta are misleading. I went against the reviews & bought it & was glad i did ! If you like the previous driver games, you will not be dissapointed with the 3rd ! The missions arent as simple as some may say, & theyre interesting as well as the story line. The handling of the cars is just like the previous driver games, great weapons, so Ive been very happy with this one. I was almost instantly addicted. My one & only very very minor complaint is that your character could run a little faster than he does, but it doesnt cause any game play issues, id just like to run faster. So yes, Driver fans buy this game & overlook any review that complains that its not grand theft auto!.....because it is not grand theft auto, its DRIV3R & its well worth the money.$LABEL$1
Great Book. I have used this book for self study as I wasn't a great math student in high school. The only thing that would make this book perfect would be a companion student solution book.$LABEL$1
Not worth it. The camera angles in this DVD set were terrible.

Planet of the Dead Kept the Doctor Moving!. Even though David Tennant was busy with "Hamlet", and the Doctor did not have an official companion, "Planet of the Dead" is classic Doctor Who with another great performance from David Tennant.

A book not to buy. The book has a lot of data that is mostly correct. The examples codes are another matter.

Might As Well Be a Placebo. Didn't do a damned thing. Didn't improve or regulate my sleep, mitigate any depression or my appetite. Not a damned thing. I wasn't expecting a miracle or for it to do everything the bottle says it *might* do, but I figure out of three, it would at least help one thing (sleep, mood, appetite)but nope. Nada. I was really looking for a natural, gentle, non-prescription aid (not necessarily a solution, just something to help)and thought I had found it. No such luck. Oh well.Bear in mind, different things work for different people so don't necessarily take my review as the gospel--it's just my honest experience.$LABEL$0
Won't use anything else!. I love this foundation! It's not greasy, and the pump with the brush is fantastic - I don't have to get anything on my hands! I use one pump on each cheek and then will spread any residue left on my forehead and chin. The color blends so well with my skin. I use Clinique Superpowder on top and I'm good to go for the day with nice even skin! Love it!My only complaint at this point is that I can't find it anywhere but online, and I don't understand why. I found it through an in-store demo at Sephora, and bought it there a few times. In the last year or so, every time I go in there and ask for it, they have no clue what I'm talking about. Same thing with Ulta, or any other makeup store that stocks Too Faced. It makes me a little nervous that they are going to discontinue it, but it is usually on TooFaced's best seller list and it has rave reviews on their website. Who knows. As long as I can get it online, I'm happy.$LABEL$1

Bitter disappointment. This could have been a great book if the characters were better developed. I felt almost cheated the further I read on ... realizing that the mystery and vagueness of Harley and his sisters' personalities were leading nowhere.

Don't flatter yourself Tawni, you're only an amateur.$LABEL$0

this is good stuff!. i had heard about the LoEG movie coming out, and i heard later that it was based on a comic book. being a new comic fan, i went out and got this, and i was impressed! the art is great, the premise is fantastic, the plot development is superb and these guys do a marvelous job of giving it that 19th century feel (the language, etc). if you have never read LoEG and want to start, start with this book. it is the first few issues where everyone is introduced, and it is just fabulous!this has been Apollyon$LABEL$1
I Don't Get It. How did the watcher know Rainie's secrets? Didn't anybody ever wonder what happened to the guy who killed her mother--he had a wife and child. Was he a local man? What did Rainie do with his body when she moved it? How did a man as young as Richard Mann supposedly know so much about what Rainie did? It seemed as if he knew what "really happened", then somebody says that he thought she killed her mother and was disappointed that she didn't. This book didn't make a whole lot of sense. Halfway through it I remembered I had read The Other Daughter, and I didn't like that one either.$LABEL$0
Broke after just a few months. I purchased an entire set of Sensa-Trac shocks for my F-150 in March 2012. One of the rear shocks is now leaking and will have to be replaced just 10 months later. The heaviest item that I have hauled in my pick-up is a sofa bed. I never overload my truck and I am rather puzzled as to why the shock is now leaking. I realize that in any mass manufacturing process errors occur, but Monroe shocks I have installed in the past have lasted far longer than I had ever thought possible. I realize that Monroe has a warranty on material failure, but it is an hassle to go through the warranty process for a simple shock. I am rather disappointed to say the least.$LABEL$0

This is not his natural style. 1st of all let me say I think Ian is a real talent. Unfortunately, he diverted too far from his natural style here. I suppose he was trying to get air play and feed his pocketbock. I don't blame him, although his real talent does not come through here. He probably agrees as well. I bought this because I like most of his stuff. Glad this wasn't my 1st Ian Matthews purchase because I wouldn't have bought his other great material.

Just one of a number of "ranking " books.... on the market at the same time. Ultimately subjective, but the top 10 & bottom 10 won't vary much book to book. The authors & their 700 plus historians are 20th century men & women. Many of them have their own agendas & are judging 18th & 19th century men. The times a president is elected to has everything to do with his rating. Does he rise (or fall) to the challenge? Lincoln is always #1. One reason. The Civil War. By far it is the most important event in American history. He suceeded. Nobody can predict where he would rank if the Civil War had been averted. It would not be #1. This book has good pictures so that student can get a good look at their presidents. It is useful as a reference book on the high school level.$LABEL$0
No action, no mystery, boring characters. This book is certainly dark, which is usually a good thing, but it did nothing for this book at all. There's a boy named Nothing that has sex with any and all of his friends and does drugs. Also, an abuser character that beats up his woman, a psychic boring character named Ghost, and 3 vampires that aren't very interesting. People do drugs, kill each other, kill their best friends, sleep with their fathers, some people get pregnant, some run away from home...yawn. If this book is supposed to be interesting because it's dark and shocking, I say that isn't enough, there still has to be an entertaining plot. I didn't care who killed who in this book, the characters were all so unlikable and one dimensional. I couldn't finish it. I like dark fantasy and horror, but only if there is a plot. I'm not interested in reading about people's screwed up lives, even if their are vampires involved.$LABEL$0
Not very good. It's hard to be honest - as I really wanted to like, even love, this album just as much as their other ones - but I must be truthful, and therefore I must say this album is the worst ever. It is hard to see great artists sell out and commercialize their music, but Orbital has done so and their new album is nothing more than a watered down, phony imitation of their previous work. They didn't need to change, and in effect ruin their music, but they have on this album. Check out their previous albums, they are all very good - contrary to this new one. I hate to say it, but giving it two stars is really being nice.$LABEL$0
Didn't want it to end!. Even though I lived through the 60's & saw from the news some of what was going on in the south, I had never seen it as portrayed in this book.

An Absolute Must Read. First, let me tell you that before you even start to read this book you need to go purchase the follow-up Loose Ends. Why, because once you put this one down, it doesn't matter what time of day it is, you will want more so why torture yourself by having to wait until the store opens?Know that the 3 primary characters of this book are so detailed that you will see a movie in your head as you read. I wrote Electa Rome Parks several years ago after reading this book to tell her that she needs to work out the movie rights NOW. Main characters would be Sanaa Lathan, Morris Chestnut, and Boris Kodjoe. Need I say more? You will not put this book down. To hell with cooking dinner, give the kids a McDonald's gift card and send them on their way so you will not be disturbed!$LABEL$1

Finally, a charger that works with my Zen Microphoto!. My wife and I both have Zen Microphotos. She plugs hers into a stereo at work and listens to stuff all day. She's a pharmacist and works 12 hour shifts, so she needs some variety. The problem was her battery wouldn't hold up all day. We tried some cheap universal adapters that didn't work very well. I hated the thought of spending $30, but it made a huge difference. Now she can plug into the stereo and the wall and listen all day without a problem. The product works great, just wish I didn't have to spend so much$LABEL$1
Works well, but hard to match color. We used the tub/shower repair kit this weekend. We had a short but wide crack in the top of the shower that had been there since we initially installed the shower . . . hit the corner against a 2x4. Anyway, we are preparing to sell the house and wanted to fix the crack. This product worked very well to fill the crack. It smoothed out well. The only problem, is that we could not get the color to match our beige shower, no matter how hard we tried. The color mixture always ended up looking too peachy. So we went ahead and filled the crack with the peachy mixture, then covered the peachy patch with beige fiberglass shower touch-up paint. You would never know there was a crack there before!$LABEL$1
An over-priced wet/dry vac. We recently bought a home with a lot of ceramic floor tile, so I bought this item last January, paying around $250 for it. I am disappointed with both the quality and performance of this machine.The Hoover cleaner that it supposedly requires is expensive and not readily available. Save your money and use either Armstrong Floor Cleaner or NON sudsy ammonia. The detergent container locks securely about 30% of the time; requires multiple tries (read:spills) to make it stay on. The wand cracked after 1 use. The hose connection, like the detergent cup, does not latch securely, rendering the small tools ineffective, since the cleaner cannot be dispensed or removed. Neither the floor nor grout brush (mounted on the upright unit) is effective in cleaning the grout in between tiles.If your floor is very lightly soiled, it may work just fine. The best thing I can say about this machine is that at least you aren't using dirty buckets of water to clean your floors!$LABEL$0

Overrated. This movie has many inaccuracies (see: movie-mistakes.com) and a weak plot, definately no epic or contender for older 'sword and sandal' films. This one has it's moments, some good dialogue, the battle scenes are very engaging, but do not show what is actually happening in them, though I'm sure people who worked on the film know. I can't believe so many people like this movie. It is too long and boring. Watch TLC and A&E instead.$LABEL$0
Faith. Faith is everywhere even when you don't know you have it. Love of your mother is endless and strong and protective. Very Awesome story a must read to test your Faith.$LABEL$1
Works well, no errors. Purchased in Summer '08. I've used it on laptops, my home server, and several desktops. Works fine for everything I've tried, including firmware updating and transferring old files from floppy archives. Very quiet and seems a bit faster than the internal drives I've used in the past. It's even been able to read a few 'problem' disks that I didn't think I'd be able to pull data from. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1
not a very good movie.. I just finished watching Dogville. The concept and story are awesome. The acting and script are decent at best - I think von Trier did everything in one take and didn't care how wooden or emotionless the acting was as long as he had the shot. The use of the narrator is such a lazy thing to do - a director should show the audience what the characters are thinking and feeling, not tell them. I don't have a qualm with narrations if used only a few brief times in a film. Dogville uses narration very frequently and for no real reason other than Lars von Trier didn't feel like showing (or couldn't figure out how to show) the audience what is happening. The editing is dreadful. There are random jump cuts that exist for no reason (unlike, say, Traffic or Memento where the jump cuts make sense or at least look awesome). The film annoyed me more than it entertained me or made me think. I rate the film a 2/5, mostly for the concept and story. Dogville had so much potential.$LABEL$0
Camera battery. The battery was not as advertised and did not fit my camera. However, the company was very good and getting a refund was super simple. 5 stars for the company$LABEL$0
Practical, down-to-earth, and extremely helpful. What a welcome relief from the many real estate gurus out there. Buying real estate and maintaining rental properties involves time, money, people skills and management know-how. Jorgensen doesn't offer you a get-rich scheme. On the contrary, he gives great tips on how to become familiar with real estate prices in your area via a journal so that when a good deal comes along, you'll know it. He also gives valuable advice for analyzing properties and for keeping property maintenance bills down.$LABEL$1
Most touching children's book. Let me echo the sentiment that children learn what we teach them; no matter how foreign it may be to us, they can grasp any idea we throw their way. Cultural issues aside, I find this the most touching young children's book I have encountered for its completely unaffected demonstration of motherly affection. And truly, the illustrations enrich the beauty of the text. For the first time in my life I purchased a book for the sole purpose of dismantling it because I wanted a framed image over my daughters' bed daily pronouncing, "I will love you forever and for always because you are my dear one." Always the best gift for new mothers!$LABEL$1
Not for the eTrex series. Please be aware of an important issue with this cable, even though it is recommended for the eTrex GPS series it will not fit their flat 4 pin connector.I had to return mine and bought one at the local REI$LABEL$0
Good photography but little factual detail. A well presented book with a wide variety of photographs making it a good source of ideas for interior designers. Beyond that there is little to commend it. Most of the pictures are not referenced, even those of grand or unique designs of fireplace. The commentary is lacking in technical and historical detail and the organisation into historical periods is only loosely adhered to. Not a bad coffee table book but not much good if you want information on designing, building or choosing a fireplace.$LABEL$0
awful-it is not maroon but purple!!!. I recently purchased this same tie from the WB harry poter store . I actually got the chenille scarf and tie set which is about 43.00, anyways it is this same tie and it was dark purple NOT Maroon at all. I suggest you buy your tie from Wild Ties their tie is exactly the right color, less expensive and also better quality.$LABEL$0

Shake and Take is a great buy!. For anyone who enjoys smoothies, or wants a quick meal this is a great purchase. Add some yogurt, fruit, protein powder with fat free milk or orange juice & mix it up and it is a terrific breakfast or lunch! It fits perfectly in the drink holder in your car as you head out for your destination.$LABEL$1
didn't work. I was using this to connect an Apple Cinema Display (DVI) to a laptop with only a VGA output. It never worked. I even tried a different DVI LCD monitor and other laptops and PCs and couldn't get this to work. I could tell power was passing through, but no video.I ended up returning this item.$LABEL$0
Very Enjoyable. I loved this book from the first chapter. Before I knew it I was finished. I would highly recommend this book. All the town's people are interesting and entertaining. An Sookie is a very fun character to follow.$LABEL$1
Not what I expected.. Did not like this at all. It was totally not what I wanted. Kept only becauseit would cost more to send it back.$LABEL$0
Buy the newer PTs. While I enjoy ll materials LSAT, this test is simply not in line with the current LSAT and not worth the purchase. For example, it has a pattern game in the LG and 2 question prompts in the LR. While it is possible that these forms will make a comeback, given their lack of use for 10+ years, the odds are against that. Spend you hard earned money on more relevant material like a recent PT OR buy on of the $20 books with 10 tests.$LABEL$0
Not What I Expected. After being told to read this "great feminist novel" I picked it up, planning to read it on a trip. While it wasn't what I expected, I can relate to Sasha's wanting to be beautiful, but what I found annoying is her need for every man to find her desirable. Does she really need to know if her therapist finds her attractive? She expected a perfect life, because of her looks, but her life wasn't any different then a realistic one.$LABEL$0
Whiny. Annoying. Can't watch. Not funny.. Her antics is not very entertaining and very annoying to watch. I borrowed this dvd from the library and glad I didn't invest money but unfortunately my time. The only time i can tolerate the video is when she was actually serious and informative about childbirth.$LABEL$0
There is better (pre/post) Holocaust fiction out there. This is my first Oates book to read. She is a talented writer -- clever, metophorical, and she does know how to develop characters. However, there are better books out there that are not sterotypical "Holocaust" fiction -- even if it is post-Holocaust fiction. For a good,accurate, distrubing,and thought provoking read try Blood From the Sky, Mendelssohn is on the Roof, The Painted Bird, or even Ida Fink's The Journey. If you are going to read Holocaust Fiction (even if it set in modern times) read something worthwhile.$LABEL$0
panasonic phones. this is the second set of cordless panasonic phones i've purchased in a year. The handset ringers in all handsets stopped working within two weeks.Other than that the phones are great. These are used in a shop enviroment and it was suggested to me that perhaps the speakers panasonic uses are sensative to dust or magnetic fields (there are welders present).Whatever the case the older panasonic phones didn't have this problem, I had a set I bought in 1999 that had no failures other than a battery in four years.$LABEL$0
Great story. If one does not have access to a good lawyer: This is what happens. I still can not understand how Mr.Carter found the strength to keep his fight ?!$LABEL$1
Worst piece of trash I have read.. Most of the book is based on hearsay.

This is not the Barry that we all know and love.$LABEL$0
Terrible Value for Tahoe/Suburban Owners. This manual is a terrible value. The paper quality is just barely above newspaper. Pictures are dim, outdated, and do not fit my 99 Suburban which is listed on the cover. They tried to cram too many GM truck versions into one book. The proper value should be $5-$10. I bought it to help me replace my fuel pump. I found better instructions and advice on the internet in about 20 minutes that were my exact year and model.$LABEL$0
How will they do the movie??. I read the book and loved it. I agree, there were some really slow parts. But I loved this book. I began to feel very close to the characters. I cannot wait for the movie. I am curious to how they are going to do all of those flash backs. I will be there on Feb.12th waiting in line. What a perfect weekend to release it. (Valentine's Weekend.) It is sure to be a success.$LABEL$1
magneet fell off first day. The glue they use is not good at all. Plastic sign came off the magnet withing 24 hours of receiving my order.

Need to buy some decent glue to make it whole again, assuming the wife hasn't already thrown it away.$LABEL$0

Where is my stuff. I've emailed to the seller about I haven't received my book. That has been over a month from the date I purchased the book. But no one answer me yet.

Too loud, doesn't do much. I got this thing when I first bought my 360 because of all the crap I heard about the 360 overheating. My first complaint is that the fan noise is even louder than the xbox dvd drive noise (which is pretty loud). Unless you have whatever you're playing/watching turned up pretty loud, this thing will noticably drown some of it out. I ended up taking it off because of this.As for the cooling aspect, I have played many hours both with and without this fan and have noticed no difference whatsoever. I have noticed that the air coming out of the 360 feels cooler, but the system never crashed regardless of whether I had this thing on or not.The only reason I am giving this thing 2 stars is because I would imaging if you WERE having a problem with cooling (like if you lived in a hot climate or had a lemon), then this would probably keep your xbox cooler.$LABEL$0
Very nice to stand on. I love the mat. It is extremely comfortable to stand on. The only issue at all is that I sometimes catch my foot on the edge of the mat, but I think I'd do that with any mat. It's just something you need to get used to. The mat does lay totally flat.$LABEL$1
I concur - DRM invalidates this purchase. ...my wife pre-ordered this for me because she knew how excited I was about the game. Just now heard about the SecuROM DRM infection though - which invalidates this as a legitimate purchase.DRM does not stop piracy. Doesn't slow them down. It does however destroy the rights of honest consumers, like me, who now no longer wants a game that was salivated over for years because the DRM infection will make the game disk worthless to me probably in a matter of months.Because of this, piracy is the better option for all. If you want to stop the DRM infection, but don't want to be a pirate, refuse to purchase this game and let it be known that the DRM is why you aren't buying it.$LABEL$0
Glad I didn't buy it. I'm glad i checked it out on Netflix before buying it for my action movie collection. I'm not sure what the 3 stars and up are talking about.

The best new country artist in a long time. This CD has it all to the up beat Put Your Heart Into It, to the sad but strong One Solitary Tear. I would tell every one who likes country music, and even those who don't to get this CD, it'll suprise you.$LABEL$1
Love it. I ordered the 1L in black. This new taller and more slender design fits better in my cup holder than my old 1L Camelbak Eddy which I lost. This thing makes me drink WAYYY more water than any other type of bottle. Something about Camelbak--I'm sucking on that thing and the next thing I know I've drank 500 ml of water! So easy. The black color is really cool also$LABEL$1
Not as nice as the photos. I ordered this set for our everyday and formal use. I was very dissapointed when I received them, as they really looked nothing like the photo. The flatware had some sharp-ish edges, and the hollow spots were dirty. The weight wasnt very substantial and they felt cheap. They are nothing like the stunning Wallace Grand Baroque in Sterling. They should try again. This stainless set is not worth it. AND, it didnt include the box!!$LABEL$0
Excellent for study. This study Bible is excellent for study, but since I wanted the large print edition, it is really too heavy to easily carry around on a regular basis. There are lots of interesting, thought provoking notes and lots of references to look up for further study. I highly recommend it. As I mentioned the only drawback is the weight, but there is no way to change that and still include all the useful notes.I, therefore, highly recommend it for study, but would suggest something different if you want something to carry with you.PEM$LABEL$1
Movie with a great message. The 17 Miracles is excellent and shows Mormon pioneers and what they suffered to come to Utah. It is moving and I could see it over and over.$LABEL$1
This game is horrible!. After getting demos of both Amplitude and Frequency I thought that this game is horrible. It deserves one star because of the great soundtrack. Other than, this game is horrible. I am more of an action, adventure, extreme sport gamer. This game has the WORST PLOT EVER! DDR is way better even though it isn't that great at least you get a workout. If you are going to spend your well-earned $40 dollars on this game it is the same thing as flushing $40 down the toilet. Why not just learn how to play an instrument, it is much funner. (Electric guitar and ALL of percussion is the best.) Any way, this game is the worst ever. Either that or Dark Summit but that's another review.$LABEL$0

Ann is the Best. If you believe that a soldier who lost 3 limbs in Vietnam "sacrficed nothing for his country"; that the widows of 9/11 "were the happiest widows ever" and that a decorated Marine combat veteran who disagrees with Ms. Coulter "is why soldiers invented fragging" then she is the best.If you love your country more than your ideology, she is as one conservative columnist put it this week "simply disgusting."$LABEL$0
Snore!!!. I purchased Hannible the same time I picked up The Silence of The Lambs Special Edition, because of the "Save ... when you purchase both movies" coupon on the covers. Having not seen Hannibal previous to my purchase, I thought,"What the hell...I'll save a couple bucks." I could have saved the entire purchase price and rented this piece of junk. Though, it picks up where "Silence", left off, Jodi Foster isn't in it, and the plot seems dorky. Way too ... for such a dull movie. If you enjoyed "Silence", get it...but don't waste your time or money on this one. Rent it first, then decide whether you really want to add this ... to your collection. Anyone wanna buy a copy?$LABEL$0

What a Keeper. This album is noisy and it makes me want to dance. Is funky the right word? It is guitar driven, funny and the vocals are a unique ball of fuzz. I am hooked and it was only recently that I learned about the band itself. I recommended this band especially the album to anyone who also likes Kasabian, Flannelmouth, Boy or Franz Ferdinand for their energy, massive sound and arena enthusiasm. My favourite tracks are "Go home get Down", "Blood on our Hands" and "Cold War". Perhaps you will like them too.$LABEL$1
regression. The Cranberries were once a band that had a mission to purge their souls of pain. Now the band is at the lofty heights of fame and success. As always at such altitude comes the unrelenting stressors of maniacial producers and record label executives who make unreal demands on the creative process. For many artists this can kill one's creativity. This has happened to Dolores.On top of that Dolores is now married. She seems to be happier. Happiness has a flip side for disturbed artists: it also kills their creativity!Hence, you have "Bury The Hatchet", a watered down album that is lacking in originality, added is a feeble attempt to cover up this lack of originality with the song "Copy Cat", which actually sums up the compilation of songs on this release.$LABEL$0
Desert Island Recording. I have been playing harmonica most of my life. One might say I have dedicated my life to the pursuit.This is the best blues harmonica album that has ever been recorded (Junior Wells Hoo Doo Man Blues being a close second).Not only is Walter's playing what harmonica players should be measured against, the wonderful material, production andcomsumate support from the musicians for the songs and the artist are beyond reproach.At the end, it is the master work of a amazingly talented harmonica player, with a lifetime of gigs behind of him,delivering a work for the ages. Bravo Big Walter. This recording continues to enrich my musical life. Tim Gartland$LABEL$1

Very helpful. Covers all the bases.. This book is very informative if your child has a brain or spinal cord tumor. It is broken into easy to read sections. The quotes from people who already lived through this were priceless. I helps put things in perspective for you. It gives you tips on how to deal with unusual circumstances. It has lots of resources for contacting other organizations on the web as well. Very helpful for me and my family.$LABEL$1

Beautiful. Somehow, I always have a fondness for beautiful picture books. I always feel that a children's picture book should be something of beauty that is timeless...something that we can all treasure but something that is especially written in the straightforward language that a child understands. This is certainly not one of those mediocre, trashily illustrated, dime-a-dozen children's book. It is the uplifting story of Jessie, a girl who comes to America to begin a new life. The language is simple but beautiful, and Jessie is someone who we can all love. And the illustrations...oh!!! They are so gorgeously realistic; especially the cover with its beautifully done painting of immigrants watching the Statue of Liberty as they arrive in America. Beautiful story, beautiful pictures...what more could you want? "When Jessie Came Accross the Sea" is the kind of book that every child should have.$LABEL$1
Where's the ending?. As I was dwindling down to the last few pages, I wondered howthe author would wrap up this story.

A "MUST HAVE" text for teachers!. I have had this text checked out from my university library the entire semester, renewing it several times! I just didn't want to let it go. So, I am now finally purchasing one for myself. Pamela Farris has done an outstanding job with this text in both the amount and quality of information she furnished. The student resource guide section alone is worth the price of the text and the content is priceless! This is of course my personal opinion and in no way do I imply it to be the position of Amazon.$LABEL$1
Slow and Ineffecient. I hate this phone. I bought it for its looks but frequently want to throw it accross the room. It is slow - frequently does not take all the numbers you enter unless you press them slowly. I would say that out of every 5 numbers I dial, i have to dial one again. The date resets if it looses power for one second - no backup battery or capacitance to hold a charge. Phonebook sucks. Speakerphone sucks. I hate this phone.$LABEL$0
Another great CD by this group.. I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for my husband. He already had "Underneath The Kudzu" which is also great. They sing a different type of song which is catchy and clever. Who could go wrong with a group that sings "If Bubba Can Dance, I Can Too".$LABEL$1
Worst monitor I've ever had. I received this monitor as a shower gift and I cannot get it to work. I've called customer service 4 times with no resolution. They sent me a replacement base and replacement rechargable batter pack, but it did not fix the problem. I believe there is a short in the on/off switch in the parent unit. This is far to much hassle for me at 9 mos pregnant preparing for baby's arrival. Be prepared, customer service consists of ONE person. I've waited on hold for over 20 mins at least twice. I'm returning this poor product for something different.$LABEL$0
Strap breaks on first use. Extremely disappointed in this bag. It wasn't even heavily loaded, just some folders with papers, keys, phone, make up, wallet.

My Favorite SC Book!. I have read many, many SC books and this one is my favorite! Unlike in many of the others, Gift Horse's ending is not very predictable and Stevie actually faces a serious problem with not only another individual but with herself. Too often SC characters are happy-go-lucky, perfect girls without any problems, but in this book Stevie goes through a genuinely painful and realistic time. If you're gonna read a SC book, read this one. Will Stevie have to give up her beloved first horse to No-Name's rightful owner? Read the book to find out!$LABEL$1
Who wrote this anyway???. I have thoroughly enjoyed James Patterson's other Detective Cross novels - but who wrote this one??? The prose was choppy, disjointed, and jumped from one thought to another with no thread in between. My ten-year-old writes with more continuity and interest. The whole vampire thing seemed more for the gore than any plausible criminal plot. Oh well, I'm hoping he gets his pen back on future novels.$LABEL$0
Doomed romance. Something was off-putting in the tone of this book. Perhaps it comes from lines like "I love when working-class people say smart things." Besides that, Allen struggles to understand a tragic romance, but she seems selective about what she reveals of herself.$LABEL$0
Makes such a huge difference in drying time!. This towel is great. I received it as a gift, and love it. It really does dry my hair quicker than a traditional towel, and as a result, means much less blow drying time. Not only do I get ready faster, but my hair is starting to look healthier due to less blow-drying. My only complaint would be that it doesn't hold in a turban very well. But it is definitely worth the purchase, regardless!$LABEL$1
The other side of Madredeus. Rodrigo Leo, amongst other adventures, has played with Madredeus for a long time. Somewhere along the way, he and accordeonist Gabriel Gomes left and, for me, the group lost a great deal of its magic ( although Gabriel is now back, on the group's latest album ). Although this is much more a classical music album than a pop one, if you get to buy it, you certainly will try to get the more recent ones. In Portugal, just a few weeks ago another one was published ( Alma Mater ) where, if you love the " old times " Madredeus, will find a soothing a reason to smile again.$LABEL$1
New Design. As another reviewer has mentioned, Pampers has changed the design. We also hate the new design, but Amazon has the old design in stock. There's unfortunately no difference at all in the box or product labeling, so I suppose what you get is open to chance.$LABEL$0
One of the best !!!!. A very disturbing movie that we all should take our time to watch.Outstanding acting and a story that we all should stop in front off and appreciate how luck we are that we leave in countries there we can take the "bad guys" to justices. There is so many countries where women are not protected in the society and this movie only shows as one country.Very strong movie that should touch us all at heart, man and woman.$LABEL$1
Carson Is King, But Show Us Something New!. This is the second time (at least) that this company has put previously released material in a new wrapper. 30 years of Carson and we keep getting a rehash (and rehash of rehash!) of previous titles. If the company and Mr. Carson's estate are too inept or lazy to dig a little deeper into the tens of thousands of hours of available Carson-era "Tonight Show" material, then just release DVDs of the old syndicated cut-up series "Carson's Comedy Classics", or even the old prime-time anniversary specials. We'd finally get to see some new material with minimal effort on the company's end.$LABEL$0
excellent. Premium was one of the best films I saw last year.In a climate of formulaic plots and predictable storylines, I found Chatmon's writing to be authentic and CREATIVE, two elements often missing in today's cinema. I enjoyed the perfomances of the actors, especially Zoe Saldana. I don't think I have ever been moved by any of her performances until seeing Premium. I really liked her and belived her and I attribute that to direction, once again, Chatmon bringing something fresh to the screen. Dorian Missick was textured and Hil Harper, tangible.I love seeing people of color on screen with purpose and presence. This film delivers that for me and I will buy it to have it alongside the other credible films in my library.$LABEL$1

Extreme Hastle. The 32MB capacity of this card is a great value compared to the standard PS2 memory cards. However, this is completely outweighed by the inconvenience of having to load a cd to initialize the card every time you wish to use it. I now only use it to store game data that I don't use regularly and have reverted to a standard card for day-to-day use. (Rating would be a 5/5 if initialization wasn't necessary).$LABEL$0

Zoom gone mad!. I bought the grdx97 camera new, back in march 2005. This past month or so, the camera has begun malfunctioning. When turned on, within a few seconds of recording, the zoom automatically starts, resulting in a blur. I tried changing the zoom feature to limit the max zoom at 12x, but still, it zooms to the max of 12x, thus limiting my ability to film anything at home.The warranty is labor 3monts, parts 1 year. There is no customer service I can talk to at the toll free JVC number. Therefore, I have to drive to the nearest service center which is apparently an independent business. All of the service centers are > 30 minutes away.I never thought I would be having problems 5 months after purchase!$LABEL$0
Not the best, but close. This isn't the best Bad Religion album, but it's pretty close. All the songs are good, but some just aren't that memorable and sound a little repetitive to me after a while. There's a lot of good songs here though; my favorites are "Recipe for Hate", "Kerosene", "American Jesus", "Watch it Die", and "Don't Pray on me."This is a good album if you are a Bad Religion fan, and a pretty decent introduction to the band. However, I recommend Generator, Stranger than Fiction, and 80-85 over this. Still pretty darn good though.$LABEL$1
An Exceptional Film. Set in the state of Georgia, James Garner renders a powerful and very sensitive performance of a Judge who following the death of his wife, retires from the bench. He tries to with-draw from life esconced in his own grief and bitterness. The mys-tery surrounding an old friend's refusal to accept the Congressional Medal of Honor, and the personal crises in the lives of those closest to him, compel him to step back into the mainstream of society . As he reaches beyond his own pain and into lives of others, he not only becomes an anchor for them, but finds a renewed reason for living, himself.The supporting cast is superb, esp. Bill Cobbs and Ruby Dee.This is an exceptional film, providing wholesome entertainment.$LABEL$1
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. this was the worst tasting dried mangos i have ever ate. they were so dry that it hurts my teeth trying to bite through them. it seems like they packaged the worst part of the mango pieces (like the skin or pieces near the core/seed). in each pack, only 10% of the mango pieces were actually good, all the rest i had to throw away because i just couldn't eat them. now i still have about a full case with no one wanting to eat them.$LABEL$0
Lovely but for the static electricity.. I've been using my burr grinder for about a year now. The good news is that it grinds the beans perfectly every time. The bad news is that it's a mess to clean (necessary every couple weeks) and worst of all, the grinding creates so much static electricity that when you remove the reservoir from the machine, there is a small burst of grounds that explodes from it and ends up on the machine and the counter. If you live in an area with high humidity, this might not be such a problem. But, if you live in a dry area (here in California, it's dry from May to October), then static will be a headache.Capresso could probably correct this by making the little bin out of metal instead of plastic so the static would discharge through the machine.Otherwise, it's a wonderful device and I recommend it if you're fussy about your coffee.$LABEL$1

Stone Fox. The name of this book is Stone Fox. The author is John Reynolds Gardniner. My favorite character's Search Light. The story takes place on a farm in Indiana. I didn't find a moral to this story because I did not like it. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone! That is just me though. Stone Fox's ending didn't surprise me. It bored me and it did not have excitement. It was just a little fantasy to me. I didn't like this book at all!$LABEL$0
A wonderful version of a classic tale. Polacco's book is a time honored theme, this retelling from the Ukraine. When Luba saves the Wren's life her parents insist she return to ask for a favor. The parents never seem to be satisfied and send Luba back time and time again. In the end the parents are returned to the happy couple they were when they started. This book can be successfully compared with any of the many available versions of the Fisherman and His Wife but also contains elements from The Stonecutter -- another tale available in several versions. Sometimes those with seemingly little power/wealth think other situations would make them a different person or happier. And when they do obtain power their humility is lost. Satisfaction seldom comes when one has not earned that power or wealth. Polacco's wonderously beautiful watercolors brings this theme into the full vision of readers. A delightfully new twist on a classic tale.$LABEL$1
For the Tintin fan who has all the books. My family collected Tintin and Asterix books when I was growing up. My parents have a complete set as do several of my sisters. "Tintin: The Complete Companion" was the perfect gift for them."The Complete Companion" discusses the political, scientific, and sociological climate present when Herge wrote the Tintin books. It is very satisfactory to read about the state of space travel and to know where Herge was citing research and where he was leaping ahead.This is not a story book but inquisitive minds from 8-88 will enjoy it.$LABEL$1
Smashing read. If you have any interest in Africa, its' exploration, peoples and/or geography this book is for you. I have long heard the story of Stanley and Livingstone but never the details. This book fills in all of the voids. I found it a very enjoyable read. I recommend it.$LABEL$1

Poor Movie Format. Movie is formated such that it's less than TV resolution. This is the second movie I've rented on Amazon like this. Amazon needs to step up and tell us what the format is.

Standells - 'Hot Ones' (Sundazed) 2 1/2 stars. Originally released in 1966,it was their follow-up to the 'Dirty Water' album(see my review).While I admit it is NO where near as good as 'Dirty...','Hot Ones' is a so-so CD reissue full of mostly the Standells performing covers,from you guessed it,1966.Tracks that I thought were 'okay' include Donovan's "Sunshine Superman",Lovin' Spoonful's "Summer In The City",the Beatle's "Eleanor Rigby" and the Trogg's "Wild Thing".Very little originality here,but hey...plenty of records are like that.You know?For big-time Standells fans,like myself.$LABEL$0

ONE OF THE BEST EVER!. I am a former elemetary teacher, therefore, I have read hundreds of children's books! This book (The Last Safe House) is one of the very best books I have ever seen or read. The story AND the illustrations are wonderful. I read this book to an elderly group and they, too, were totally captivated. Children-YES; adults-YES. ps One of the elderly asked me to order for her grandson. I have placed my order with Amazon and, for sure, I will order again!TRUST ME, (if you are interested in this subject), this book will bring it all together in most enjoyable and informative ways!$LABEL$1
This product is NOT for beginners like it said!. I was told by a Beachbody coach that this program was great for beginners, boy was I in for a shock!

great for projects or home crafters. this self healing mat works great!as a graphic design major in college i do alot of cutting with razor blades. to this point i have been doing it on a piece of plastic which would break the tips off my blades after a few use's and dull the blade which is bad when you are cutting paper alot for projects... seeing it could cause the paper to rip instead of cut.the mat is a very large 18x24 in size with measurements on the sides and a nice grid for keeping cuts straight.this mat will be with me untill it needs to be replaced... but after using it for a year now i think it will be many more years till that has to happen.$LABEL$1
What the....?. yes i realize it is hard to put so much material into a single movie. this must be why so many great characters were ... deleted? but how can m. night NOT include certain material from the episode called "the deserter" fans know whihch one i mean. seriously katar learning how to heal while waterbending is a very key element. how exactly would m. night explain katara healing aang - that ANG not ONG - at the end of book two? no wonder this movie "won" worst movie of the year. even the expendables was better, and that was crap... so what does that mean this movie is?$LABEL$0
Stream of consciousness is funny for 30 seconds.. I suppose if you're really really stoned, this is funny. On the other hand, if you're really really stoned, Firing Line is funny.You can dig a few comedy nuggets out of this, but they're buried inside a ton of nothing.$LABEL$0
Boring. Tetris is awesome. I could play that time waster all day - but something is amiss with this game and it manages to make me not want to play.It could be the loud thumping synth and techno music that plays in the background on infinte loop, or it could be the fact that they attempted to add a story to Tetris by adding strange "creatures" that speak a more annoying version of Animal Crossing's babelese, it could be that the colors look like they have been washed out and are difficult to tell apart, or it could be that there are barely any modes to play except marathon tetris games.I think the real reason is that they just botched it. Its Tetris in some ways but there's just something off about it.$LABEL$0
Disappointed. I hope the drill operates better than it looks. The drill looks well used. Not what I expected.After 3 uses the torque setting no longer works.

I'm buying Dewalt and Porter Cable from now on...and I won't be buying them online.$LABEL$0
Easy to use, holds a bunch!. After years of trying to use empty condiment squeeze bottles or standard dispensers, this is the answer.- Holds a good amount of glue - less refilling.- Dispenses easily.- The glue level is always near the tip so it ready to dispense immediately. (No more upside down shaking to get the glue out of the bottom.)I bought the extra tips so I could cut one back to squeeze out a bunch for large panels, or put on a more finely trimmed one for smaller edge glue ups.Good tool purchase!$LABEL$1
should be cheaper. This 3 movies should be at least $30 cheaper than buying the 3 complete combos, for an extra $20 you get DVD Blu Ray 3DBLu Ray Digital copy and extra features, this item is just not worth it[...]I was just in time to buy this combo packs before their prices went up, got the 3 combo packs for $88 instead of lowering the first 3Dpack which i'm making the review of, amazon preffered to increase the prices in the separate packs$LABEL$0
Doesn't work for everyone!. My two year old daughter has been sucking the middle two fingers of her left hand since just hours after her birth. To avoid future embarassment for her and high orthodontia bills for me, I bought Mavala Stop to coat her fingers. The first night, my daughter DID keep the treated fingers out of her mouth. The next night, I found her sucking those fingers. The third night, after my daughter's bath, I coated her fingers again. Before the Mavala had even dried, she was licking her fingers like they were popsicles! So, it may be a great product for successful results with other customers, but Mavala Stop is not for us.$LABEL$0
Meh. I guess I was just expecting more from this gift, and it is partially my fault for not reading the full description better but i basically expected them to be bigger, both from the picture and just in general due to the level of detail required to reproduce the characters. I will be keeeping them and giving them as a gift as intended, and see how well they go over, but my not hoping for a lot, definitely had higher expectations for the product than what was delivered.$LABEL$0
Interesting & Well Written. Checked this book out for a water crisis research paper I was writing. This book is interesting and well written. It is full of great statistics and facts. This book covers numerous topics including water supply, sanitation, agriculture, nature conservation, and the many ways we use water. It talks about potential solutions to the problems we are causing and the importance of protecting the water cycle. Great book if you're interested in water issues!$LABEL$1

If you got this far, you can't stop now....... The final chapter in the Ring Cycle, as done by the Metropolitan Opera conducted by James Levine. This is a fine offering. Of particular highlight is Hildegard Behrens portrayal as the spurned Brunehilde. A surprise was Christa Ludwig's fine performance, not as Fricka, but as a Valkyrie (a role I enjoyed very much). The story itself ties up a lot of loose ends....Also great performance of Siegfried's death march. Definitely worth watching if you've gotten this far.$LABEL$1
DISAPPOINTING. I WAITED ANXIOUSLY FOR THIS BOOK AND AM TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED. I AM HALFWAY THROUGH IT AND DON'T LIKE IT. IT IS FAIRLY BORING AND REDUNDANT. THE CHARACTERS AREN'T PARTICULARLY LIKEABLE. IT CERTAINLY ISN'T WORTH FINISHING.$LABEL$0
Insane. This cd from the start is non stop metal. The guitar riffs are insane and it makes you want to bang your head to hell. I'ts nuts to think the vocalist is a girl, but it's true and she kicks a$$. Oh, and there is a review here by someone named 'Fred Durst's Numba 1 Fan' or something stupid like that, read his review, it's hilarious and an insult at the same time. Buy this cd and you will not regret it, I know I didn't. When you do get this cd, the last track has this ridiculously fast guitar riff. Good solid musicianship right here. Worth the money.$LABEL$1
Can't recommend linksys any longer.. I will never buy another linksys router. This is the third router that has crapped out in 2 years. When you go on their website for chat support they say that if the router is out of warranty (12 mos) they can't provide "chat" support. Nice company. It probably costs them $[...] dollars to make a router and they're selling it for $[...] and not only supporting it for a year hoping that when it fails you'll have to buy another one. I'm not sure what company has the best routers, but it's certainly not Linksys (and its parent company, cisco, is quickly becoming the crap that is Linksys).$LABEL$0

Buyer Beware!. I am surprised to read some fairly high praise for this less than mediocre attempt from Mom and daughter. Perhaps the reviewers are like me and usually find Mary Higgins Clark a good read and do not want to hurt her feelings but come on, this particular book is a dude with a capital "D". I am so sorry I purchased not one but two copies. What a waste of time, and money, not to mention the embarrassment of giving an audio version for a gift. So much for listening to certain "book reviewers" that was a mistake.$LABEL$0

Does not work for MX500 Mice. I bought this pad originally for my Intellimouse explorer mouse.Using the Intellimouse with this pad is a joy for a short while. A week later and my Mx500 arrived..this is where the problem started. I noticed the pointer moves in random directions when you move the mouse slowly. I thought that this was because the mouse had some tiny scratches on it. So i cleaned it and used it again..no luck.Today i went to staples to have it exchanged for a similar mousepad. To my dismay, the pointer still goes awry if you move the mouse slowly if used with a Mx500 mouse. So if you have a logitech mx controller.. proceed with caution.$LABEL$0

Don't get it, even if it's 1 cent. For free? Not even. Just takes up precious space where other garbage could go. WHAT A BAD GAME!

This Is More Like It. I am not a fan of electronic music so Joe's last studio effort was my least favorite of them all.This is more of what I like out of Joe.There are people playing instruments along with him and that is a plus.There are some really cool effects to go along with a strong collection of songs.I have only listened to it twice and I already know that this one is a keeper and is right up there with his other really good cd's.This guy is the Michael Jordan of rock guitar players.Chops with feeling.Both traits combined are rarely seen at this level.This group of songs are fresh yet represent everything great about Joe's music.It's alright,go ahead and get this one.You'll like it if you like Joe.$LABEL$1

Hit or Miss. I think the root problem here is that not all X-Boxes are built equally. They apparently can have a variety of different DVD drives installed in them at the factory and it's a roll of the dice as to if you got a good one or not.I had a mediocre one. Played games no problem but had skipping, stuttering or outright failure to play some DVD movies that ran just fine on my computer or new DVD player. Some people report you can play DVD-R and CD-RW, some say not.So I dunno -- this makes a nice, cheap DVD player for the kids but shouldn't be looked at as a fully reliable system.$LABEL$1

No more missed pills. I have found that I have not missed any of my medications anymore since I got this. I like how easy it is to set and change times for medications. I sleep later on weekends and it is very easy to change the alarm for a later morning pill on Saturday.I do not like the small display. I thought a missed pill would be more obvious. But it has a small text indicator.The alarm is loud enough to hear across my house, so I would think anyone who can hear a doorbell will hear this.$LABEL$1
WE HATED IT. Not only was this seat extremely difficult to figure out, the belts were cumbersome and our son - who is generally very easy going - acted as though he were being tortured every time we started the 5 minute process of strapping him in. And the memory feature on the seat belts is absurd. If there is someone with a baby that weighs the same amount and wears the same amount of clothing each and every day - perhaps they will find it more useful than we did. Go with the Britax - more money but much less frustration.$LABEL$0

how can you listen to this. how can you people listen to this sh--. I wish i could give it less than one star, but this review thing wouldnt let me. alternative rock stations that play this stuff are wrecking all good music. take slipknot for an example: they play the slowest song on the cd; then as people start to like that song, slipknot thinks that people like the slow music.

Jumpstart Games are Great for Little Scholars!. This title is third in the Jumpstart series of learning games (it starts with Toddlers) and is typical of the high quality, fun learning games produced by Knowledge Adventure. The characters are engaging for the designated age group, and the activities are both fun and encourage learning. The game increases the levels depending on your child's skill (not by a preset formula) making them more or less challenging depending on the individual, and the progress report helps you see exactly what areas your child needs help in. This software is a great compliment to the Jumpstart series of workbooks. Highly recommended!!$LABEL$1
is this really what teenage life is about?. I think that after reading this book and many other so called teenage life books, i relized that this is not really what life is for me. yes there are a few incidents when i want a boy friend, or i kiss a guy, but it is not always the most interesting thing to read over and over again in every "teen" book. Prep is kind of like that. Highschools are not all perfect, they have their flaws to them. Like crime or racists. Every teen book so far has been about the better off people, how about writing one about some people on the streets or the hood. They have stories too. they aren't just people reading stories, they probably want to read one that relates to them. Again if you want another pathetic teen book, read prep!$LABEL$0
What happened to this group?. This album was terrible compared to their first album. They need to decide what genre of music they are going to fall into.

I later saw Tracy Byrd at the same location and he was great!$LABEL$0

Was this Mansfield Park?. I love this story, and I don't necessarily expect film adaptations to be faithful to a novel in every detail. However, this film is so strangely cobbled together that I think if I didn't know the novel so well I would have had no idea what was going on. Motivation, character, and relationships need to be developed even if they diverge from the original, but the characters here were mostly two dimensional, and inconsistent. The sets, costumes and cinematography were only so-so - these are elements that can make up for a lot if the viewer is looking for pleasant entertainment. Sadly, even that was lacking.I'm not sure what this was supposed to be, but Mansfield Park it was not!$LABEL$0

Don't waste your money. First off, product you receive is not labeled Insten like the one in the picture, which leads me to believe it is not the same product as pictured.

CALPHALON NON STICK PANS. These non-stick pans are not what one expects in performance. The pan can not be used with high heat or the teflon coating peels off. If you wish to sear food on high heat it is a big problem. I do not feel the company totally prepares or informs the user adequately to this major malfunction. I informed the company of my displeasure and was told to send the pan to them, at my cost, for evaluation, Meanwhile; I am out a daily used frypan. I would not buy an overly costly Calphalon non stick product again. All my pots and pans are starting to show signs of deteriation. Not what I expected for my $500.00 investment.$LABEL$0
4 1/2 stars. if you're looking to add some vibes to your jazz collection, this is a fine fine album, and would make a good choice. mr hutcherson is a fantastic vibes player, and is joined here by herbie hancock on piano, bob cranshaw on bass, and joe chambers on drums. the entire album is special, but the tune that i really want to give a shout out about is "bouquet," a stunningly gorgeous slow-tempo piece that has soul-stirring interplay between the bass and vibes. one of my favorite slow jazz numbers of all-time. if you are considering picking up a copy of this album, i say "do it!"$LABEL$1

GREAT Beginner Pilates DVD. I hurt my feet and couldn't do the usual workouts so I turned to pilates. I am very much a beginner and this DVD was FANTASTIC!!! She explains everything well but doesn't over do it. The full workout takes about 31min. and there is a bonus workout but I haven't tried it yet because it looked like there was going to be some standing moves and I have to stay off my feet :-( I'm used to sweating and panting during my workouts and this doesn't do that (I glisten a bit). I've been doing this 2-3 times a week for about a month now and I still enjoy doing it. If you are a beginner to pilates this is a great place to start.$LABEL$1

Wait till they lower the price or hire a proofreader...... I was genuinely distracted from the content as I found myself reading every page "looking for more typos, inaccurate facts, etc". Many are noted in previous reviews....Butch Harmon is referred to as Bruce....David Duval is later called Davis....etc. I do not know the publishing process but I would think an author should have a vested interested in proofing his product....as well as many others. It is obviously an effort to cash in (the book itself had interesting facts, if you can trust themmmmm)......but also seemed disjointed and like it was slapped together without connection between chapters....bottom line - an inferior quality product given it is a 24 dollar hardcopy new book......wait for the next revision......$LABEL$0
Buy the separate Widescreen releases instead!. It puzzles me why Fox only chose to offer a PAN-AND-SCAN box of the first two Star Wars prequels.If you're a fan of these films, it's much better to buy the separate widescreen releases of each. You won't get the pretty slipcase, but at least you're getting the whole movie and not a butchered pan-and-scan version.It is rumored that when Episode III comes out on DVD this November, Fox will release a box set of all three prequels in their proper Widescreen Anamorphic format. Hopefully that rumor is true. (Though, since I already own the WS versions of Episodes I and II, I'll forgo the box and pick up the regular release of III.)$LABEL$0

poor sizing, feels like it will fall off.. These were poorly sized. They fit fairly tight until the middle of your palm but flare out from there instead of at the wrist like your typical slip on glove. They also have no elastic to hold them on your wrist. The gloves feel like they will fall off, and easily fill up with leaves/debris/etc. They do not give a sure fit and feel. These also have no elastic to them so that adds to the poor fitment.I decided I will return the product I disliked them so much. It's too bad - the fleece lining was nice.$LABEL$0

very helpful - now you can play gameboy all the time.... the good news is that you can play gameboy all the time. this little gadget plugs neatly into a side socket and provides a nice light to make the screen usable. there is definitely a reflection that is a bit annoying, but careful positioning of the light source seems to help. it pops out easily and is quite portable, so you don't mind carrying it around. and, from what i can see, it doesn't seem to drain batteries noticeably faster. although you will play more and longer, so expect to be using up more of those puppies...the bad news is that you can (and in my case - will) play more often. plus, it's easy to hold on to, so the kids can sneak into easily under the covers when they're supposed to be going to sleep. however, in the grand scheme of things, these are the prices we pay for an ever-evolving society.for the price, it's a handy addition. if you haven't already, go ahead and splurge.$LABEL$1

Simplistic, but it has a message. This is a very small and not overly challenging book with a simplistic message. Underneath the fable of the mice and the men, Johnson is dealing with change: how change can come with little warning, how different people react differently to change, how people prefer to be snug and safe and therefore fear change. The cheese here is an allegory for whatever you may value, be it money, relationships, even just cheese! What happens when your cheese suddenly vanishes and you cannot seem to get it? Do you sit and wait in the hope it will return? Do you try to find out what happened and thereby get hold of some more cheese? The book has a message so do not get put off by the fable format. What seems to be obvious and common sense is not always so in real life and sometimes a silly fable helps like a poke in the ribs. Worth a read but I find the bestseller rankings hard to believe!$LABEL$0
One Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I got this book a bit back but ever since then I have been rereading it. It is simply one of Misty's great books. Kero (or Kerowyn) is a strong female who can take care of herself. Thank you for that. She always stands up for what she believes in and doesn't let mn push her around or take advantage of her just because she is a woman. And even though she isn't exactly feminine, she still wants love. Or at least with Eldan. This book was a great one. I would recomend that you read it when you get a chance.$LABEL$1

Highly grateful for this product.. When our 12 year old dog began limping periodically we discovered he had arthritis. 300mg of enteric aspirin was suggested. We were also told that the human variety was acceptable. It worked great for the arthritis, but it upset his stomach and he stopped eating about 2/3 of his normal amount. I found this product here at Amazon and decided to give it a try. Since the aspirin is chewable, we decided to start with 1/2 a tablet to see how it worked. He's doing great now, eating better than ever, is much more active and far less "grumpy". I would recommend this to anyone with a dog in need of pain relief because it is chewable (therefore you can reduce the dose) and doesn't upset their stomachs as the human type so often does.$LABEL$1

1 of Canada's finest. This is an awesome CD by an awesome group. Although they are often overshadowed by Our Lady Peace, you can't deny what I Mother Earth did for the Canadian music scene in the mid 90's.

I Mother Earth will never be the same without Edwin, but we'll always have Scenery & Fish, one of the best albums of the 90's.$LABEL$1

So Glad for the "Official" Bonanza dvds!!. I am the happy purchaser of Official Season 1 volumes 1 & 2 and also the Official Season 2 volumes 1 & now 2.I had purchased the german dvds as the original music was on them, unlike all the other dvds of Bonanza circulating round the USA and found in dollar bins etc.But these "Official" ones are well worth the price. Firstly, for me, they have captioning, which is a boon for those with hearing losses and they naturally have the original music scores and are uncut.But they also come with great extras! There are still b&w; pix from behind the scene shootings, there are publicity clips (a video of a Rose Bowl Parade appearance in the most recent), comments from the producer, Mr Dortort, voice overs from guest stars and stuntsmen etc with tidbits about the shows, the actors and the production.For the Bonanza fan, this is MUST HAVE item. And I can only hope that more dvds for other seasons will be produced and in the same manner.$LABEL$1
Help for opening safe. This toy is a piece of junk. IF you can ever get back into it. Hints for those totally frustrated - jimmy the lock with a thin credit card. Wiggle the end of the credit card in the door space right below the area of the lock - it'll pop open then. We figured this out after trying to get the thing to open to rescue my friend's daughter's Christmas money out so we can return this!!!! Don't buy it!!$LABEL$0
The keypad failed first time out. I'm sure Garrett makes a good product all in all, but the one I purchased, a Garrett GTI 1500, failed on the first time out. In order to pinpoint and look a the size of your target, you have to press and hold the "treasure imaging" button on the keypad. Well, this particular keypad and button was poor quality and the button got stuck in the activate mode. I had to send the detector back. I recently paid more money for a different and better quality detector, and the extra money has been worth every penny. I'm not saying this is a bad detector and the one I purchased may have just been a lemon, but you get what you pay for.The refunding experience was OK. I had to send several emails and make several phone calls, but in the end, I was refunded. Garrett complained because I used a different box to return the detector, but the original box was so beat up when I received the package that I couldn't re-use it.$LABEL$0

I had fun......... this game is a very good game even if you dont like Military. Although it wasnt has good as the PC game (if you have a choice between the PC version and this one get the PC version). The different weapons and levels are good. But there is little re-play value (except to maybe boost your stats) and there we was some gliches i.g. Bad guys dont shoot at you when your 3 feet away. Not saying the AI is bad but..... its not the best. Overall this is a good game and worth the money. hope this help!$LABEL$1
Marketing Phrase Book (Professional Edition). On receipt of this book I was reminded of the Spanish proverb "cheat me on price...never on product"The content of this publication provides a useful shortcut to the dictionary. However, having paid ... for this product, I must stress my disappointment with the physical quality. It is poorly reproduced. Unless you can live with the imperfection of the reproduction, consider buying the non-professional addition of this book and save yourself a lot of dollars in the process.$LABEL$0
Found something better. Tried the Ultimate crib sheet, but had difficulty getting to the back of the crib (no wheels), and felt it was a pain to snap / unsnap that many places. After a little research, found the quick zip crib sheet by clouds and stars. Have had for 3 months now and love them!!! So easy to change - only advice is to put a flat waterproof pad underneath so you can just lift both off to launder.$LABEL$0
not what I was looking for-. I have always like EA games in the pass but this is one I should of skipped over. My main issue is this game is too much trouble to play with a mouse and just setting it up was a waste of time. I read trhe reviews before I purchased it and this is not the 1st time I bought something that had postives reviews but turn out to be a waste of both my time and money. If I though I could return it and use my money onsomething more to my liking them I would- an example of a great game is Dragon Age.$LABEL$0
Great but not right size. This is exactly what I was in need of. I constantly forget things such as "where are my glasses" and need an alarm system.Perfect in all respects except that I can not set it or read it without my glasses. I wanted big digital numbers and buttons. I went by the size shown on the specs which is incorrect (6.80 inches x 4.50 inches x 1.10 inches). Amazon may what to correct that information to the actual size which is about half the size indicated.$LABEL$0

An Absolute Joy to Play!. I purchased Civ IV for my nephew at Christmas and we had so much fun playing together and separate, when I can get him off of it, that I decided to go for the expansion. We still enjoy playing the hot seat together as well as separately conquering the game.This new installment adds some more features and characters to it. Which equates to more fun. New leaders add another bit of that fun spice to the game. Graphics are awesome. We use an iMac and love the way the whole thing looks. We have watched all of the "wonders" videos and still find that we like to re-watch them every time we play.For people who enjoy strategy games this is a must as far as expansion packs go. If you don't have Civ IV yet get it and enjoy it.I gave this game 4 stars for the fact that there is always room to expand.$LABEL$1
Football. This might make it as TV movie but I would not pay for it.

Excellent buy.. I haven't seen this show since I was 14. Now that I am much older and more experienced (presumably) I can review each episode with more insight thanks to the rewind button on my DVD PLAYER. This beats the days of me rewatching the shows on a horribly old tape player that only recorded fifty percent of the sound.This IS A BARGAIN for any fan of the show. DVD quality epsiodes of the entire seasaon for roughly $30. Amazon shipped it perfectly in tact. There were no loose discs, even though they issued a warning about it-I checked every one. I was hoping there was more audio commentary on some of the episodes but it's forgivable since this predates all this DVD extravaganza stuff.$LABEL$1
Dead Polaroid. I'm like the rest of you.Had the TV for about 14 months and it died. That's about $65.00 a month to watch TV. Now I have to pay to have it fixed, " don't know what that will cost."

What a disappointment. I expected a light read, and got even less than that. Kwitney writes briskly and uses language well; I'll give her that. But the plot was so painfully predictable, the twists so superficial, and the characters so flat that I had a hard time keeping enough interest to finish the book. The sex scenes were absurd, really worthy of the cheesy series romances. In all, I could have spent my time and money in much better ways.$LABEL$0

Uncomfortable, not padded. Hardly any give in the elastic, so much so that I'm not sure it's really elastic. It's something that resembles elastic but doesn't give and take. It just stays put like regular fabric. It feels stiff and seems to run small. There is a very, very small amount of padding at the bottom of the cup. The rest of the cup is thin silky fabric. If you're looking for nipple coverage, don't buy this.$LABEL$0
Chauvenistic!. This book was so blatantly chauvenistic! It's obviously a children's book that was written before political correctness or women's lib occurred... It stereotypes what boys "do" (be Dr.'s, fix things) and what girls "do" (help Dr.'s, break things). Read it for a great laugh!$LABEL$0

Easy read, but not all that interesting. This book is exactly as advertised - Greta's opinions on a variety of issues. While I may agree with her on a lot of issues, I'm not sure why I should care.I learned a little about tort reform, was creeped out by her section on the death penalty and found the CNN slams a little annoying by the end.Overall, this was an easy read but not all that interesting.$LABEL$0

Welcome to fantasy island... This book may as well be a science fiction novel. None of the information in this book is based on Sacred Scripture. Where he gets his interpretations of the Book of Revelation, we don't want to know.

The only thing I would recommend this book for is to start your next winter fire with.$LABEL$0
1/2 Good. So maybe I'd give it 2-1/2 stars if it was possible.The good: The visual. Very stark. Very arresting.The bad: You HAVE to convince yourself to leave believability at the door. From beginning to end.Yeah, yeah, I know this is comic book stuff. But to sit through two hours of getting beaten over the head with over the top violence gets pretty damned dull for the viewer. In my case it took me only 30 minutes to pull the plug on my DVD. Why? Because Rourke's superhuman character gets pulverized by a speeding car THREE times and walks away virtually unscathed, save for a bloodied face. But then, a few scenes later, get's knocked UNCONSCIOUS by a sledgehammer to the noggin.Huh? Direct impact by a speeding automobile inflicts almost zero bodily harm, but a hand held piece of hardware k.o.'s him?!?Safe to say I won't finish this movie anytime soon. If ever. Zzzzzzz.$LABEL$0
Ethernet protection is rubbish. The good: design is excellent, plugs are evenly spaced, no problems connecting a lot of computer equipmentThe bad: I specifically bought a couple of these because it includes Ethernet protection. Unfortunately, when I connect my Ethernet cables through this surge protector, the signal is attenuated so badly that up to 70% of packets are dropped. I've tried it with multiple different routers, switches and pieces of computer equipment with more or less the same results. Maybe I got a bad manufacturing batch, but if you are looking to use the Ethernet protection I'd advise getting something else.$LABEL$0

I love this carrier. I knew I needed a carrier that would work on both the front and back. I found this at K-mart and we love it. We had a simple one-piece cloth carrier that my son hated and it didn't fit my husband. It was complicated to get on as well. With the snugli, we didn't have any of those problems. My son loves to be facing out so we used that one most often, but the backpack is the way to go while cooking or doing other things that make having a baby in front difficult. My husband is 6'4" and 280 lbs and it fits him just fine!Buy it and you wont regret it.!$LABEL$1
efficient, loud, broken. I have owned different brands, Krups, Braun, Cappresso, Cuisinart, and Mr Coffee burr grinders.

It's back to the Braun KMM 30 for us.$LABEL$0
Works well for what it is.. Only minimum use so far, but I like it. Screen is hard to read when choosing options and menu takes a little getting used to, but it prints well and that's what you're buying it for. Wastes some tape when printing, but not more than any other label maker. When doing multiple labels I took to writing them all out on the same label but spaced out and then it's more efficient. Typing is simple with qwerty keyboard and extra tape is easy to find.$LABEL$1
Delightful, fun, and sexy.... I have just returned from a sneak preview of this film. I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed myself, as evidently did the rest of the sold-out audience. This version is simply 'different' than the Japanese original. Not better, not worse. I laughed, I cried, I was swept away by the dancing, and all the characters were memorably charming. Richard Gere can still send me swooning, and his dance moves aren't bad either! I recommend this film, but only if you want to have a super good time...$LABEL$1

Not the best HP but it kept me reading furiously. This is a great Harry potter book. My only problem was with the ending. Yes, I am sad about the major death, but that is not my issue with it. i was upset that it ended so abruptly after the death. At the end of most of the books, everything gets explained and you are left with a feeling that most things will go back to normal for him. This book makes it clear that things will be different in the next book, which makes it suck that we will have to wait another ~2 years to find out what happens. Bottom line- too much of a "cliffhanger", though its not a true cliffhanger$LABEL$1
Gershwin's Works. Though I do like Gershwins' work, this production of it is not good. I had the recording on a very old LP that I have listened to for years, and the difference in performance is very obvious. I would have thought the Chicago Symphony Orchestra would have done a good job with this, but it lacks the verve and power I have always associated with Gershwin's work.$LABEL$0

Fun, fun, fun, (again, again and again!). Like all of the books in the "Puzzle" series this book on its first reading kept my children (6 and 4 years) occupied for an age. However what sets these books apart from other "look and find" puzzle books is their ability to be re-read again and again. Even though both my children know all the answers and where the "hidden" objects are, these books are read at several times a week at least!What is especially nice about this book is that the main characters of the story are two females, a young girl and a mermaid. It is not suprising that this is my daughter's favourite book of the series.$LABEL$1
Cookware Much Too Small. I bought this cookware for my 3-year-old grandaughter, who was completely disinterested in the toy. For a start, the pots and pans are too small to actually "pretend cook" with. I also bought another item from Small World Living Toys; plastic veggies, that I assumed were shown with the cooking set. In the photo, it shows several vegetables in one pot. In reality, you could hardly fit one vegetable into the pot. The pots are extremely small. I would have returned it, but it was a gift for her birthday. Maybe her one-yr-old brother will play with it.$LABEL$0
Very good, practical information. There are not many books available about garden photography and this one will be a welcome addition. It is filled with outstanding photos and practical advice. The author explains the usual dilemmas with film, cameras, composition, etc. but also includes very good information about labeling, storing and organizing your work (a link is included for a software program that I was not aware of - thank you!).I bought this book mainly, however, for learning more about taking nature photos with a digital camera. While the author raves about the digital format and even confesses that he uses digital for most of his work now, there are only 2 photos in the entire book (out of hundreds) taken with a digital camera. This is a little disappointing and kind of puzzling. I would have liked to know more about the specifics for using digital photos for publication.$LABEL$1
An even dozen isn't better. Ocean's 12 lacks the fun of its predecessor, Ocean's 11, mostly because there really AREN'T 12 master thieves running amok....most of the cast spends their time sitting in a cell, an extremely poor decision on the director's part. Where's the humor of Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac and the Mormon Twins? Locked up for half the movie!The story theme is great: Benedict knows who ripped him off, and the insurance payment isn't enough to soothe his wounded ego; he wants it back from the thieves. Another master thief issues a challenge to the team: steal a Faberge egg before I do, and I'll pay your debt for you. The director and screenwriters lose it from there, though, by separating everyone.Still, the movie has its moments, with Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts, and a witty cameo by Bruce Willis. The ending leaves an opening for Ocean's 13, and let's hope they get a bit better script next time around.$LABEL$0
The Best Series EVER !!!!. This series is so damn good !!!!DONT MISS THIS ONE , if you do you really missed out .$LABEL$1
Love it! A must have for any woman. This is a great book with great illustrations done by the author. I really enjoyed reading it, it gives a woman a lot of different advice with out being too preachy. I have always really enjoyed Anna Johnson's writing. It is not serious, nor is it uppity or snobby. The book offers realistic, doable advice for women of all ages. It covers topics such as fashion, food, entertaining, and beauty. She has some great advice especially when it comes to dressing chicly, decorating your home on a budget. It also has some nice sections on being spiritual and giving back to your community, which I think is rare in books like this. It also encourages women to be modern women. It's not a book that expects you know know to to cook, or even to look good all of the time, just to have fun and take life with a grain of salt.$LABEL$1
They're even better live.... Just adding my .02 to all the rest of you great SW fans who've been here before me. I heard SW on the radio back in the early 90's..."What do I have to do?" from W,B,B+P and I just loved it. Bought the CD and loved the whole thing esp. "So Wrong". Then, 4 long years later comes "Darkest Days" and it blows W,B,B+P away! And I have the chance to see them up close and personal in a small local club. And let me tell you if you don't know: they rock live! The energy, the sound, the light-show! What a blast! And their sound was awesome-- so often bands just tyr to be so loud, but they were perfect. you could understand almost every word Chris Hall uttered and hear every spooky effect from the keyboards and programming. If they're coming to you town (check Stabbing Westward www.stabbingwestward.com if that html don't work) go and SEE THEM you will not be disappointed. Save Yourself!$LABEL$1

Should work very well on wood but not grout. I returned this item. But I can't give it a bad review just because it doesn't work on grout. I didn't open it, it was my neighbor who suggested that *maybe* it won't work on grout. So instead of opening it up and not working and then unable to return it, I just returned it.I'm sure it will work great on wood, terracotta, etc. But I doubt it will work on unsmooth surfaces such as grout. Our brick steps are filled with grout in between so we didn't even want to take the chance and use these in case it rains and washes it all away anyway.I must say, the price is half than what my local hardware store sells it for.$LABEL$1

Not Recommended for Educators. I am a gang and youth violence expert working with the San Diego County Office of Education, Safe Schools Unit. I have alerted many of our schools about the series of books by Stanley "Tookie" Williams. I do not recommend the purchase of this book. The content of the books are not appropriate for young people. The images of gangs are not accurate (Too much negative sterotyping). The book is written in a simplistic style that will quickly bore young students. Youth need to critically examine information not be talked down to. You may email me for alternate suggestions for gang prevention books for youth.$LABEL$0

I have noticed that Pixar still hasn't made one bad movie yet!I've liked all the Pixar movies, and this is IMO the best one.The message that I think was behind this movie was really good as well. A robot left behind and forgotten about cleaning up the Earth for 700 years and the only friend he has is a cockroach. Well I guess that he doesn't have very much else to do anyway. The animation was amazing. Some parts of the movie looked almost real.Once again, good work Pixar.$LABEL$1
Shallow. I have liked all the Janette Oke books I have read except for this one. It was shallow and disappointing. For one thing, I thought it was unrealistic that a woman would have a freight run in the "olden days". Also, the ending wasn't complete enough, like the other reviewers said. It also seemed inconsistant that a supposedly Godly man like Seth would fall for a snobby city-slicker like Rebecca (before she had her change of heart). And was Sarah ever going to marry Boyde? I thought that this book was uncharacteristically shallow and had a lack of spiritual depth unlike Janette Oke's other books. I really enjoyed her Seasons of the Heart series and A Bride for Donnigan.$LABEL$0
Heaven is Real by Choo Thomas. "I just recently read Mrs. Thomas book "Heaven is Real" and would like to ask anyone who reads it to always remember that only God's written Word is infallible." Christian's must always use Discernment when anyone prophesy's about an future events, whether it's personal or for others." It's better to pray and be on guard than to believe blindly and be spiritually infected."$LABEL$0
Bad movie, nothing to do with the seller.. It's over 3 hours long, black and white. I loved the nudity in it, but found myself falling asleep. It's extremely boring.$LABEL$0
What a let down!. Not at all impressed with this slow mediocre release. Maybe it's to appeal to the young MTV masses that have just recently discovered "punk". A few songs are tolerable, but when you have 19 tracks that isn't something to brag about. After seeing them play a good set at Warped I had some anticipation for the cd to come out - huge disappointment. Avoid! Save your $ and buy one of their better releases like And Out Come the Wolves or Let's Go.$LABEL$0
liberal spin gone wild... this is pure propaganda. as a previous reviewer said, the author has spun the facts to his liking. the cherry tree has been known to be a myth for many years. so what?he wrote the rules for civility. he voluntarily gave up power when they wanted to give him even more. he 'led from the front'.the history channel and natgeo have sold out to liberalism. liberalism is both immoral and uneconomic. liberals hate men like washington, jefferson and madison and will do anything they can to denigrate them.notice how often the narrator says 'the man' instead of 'washington'. this denotes the lack of respect he has for washington.the author is an ugly man and i'm getting real tired of these liberal distortions.thanks to all the fine people that took the time to speak out against this garbage. you guys are patriots. we can only thank our lucky stars we had a founder like george washington.$LABEL$0
BAD WRITING, BAD STORY, = ONE HECKAVA BAD MOVIE. I saw CLUELESS and after seeing it I actually thought that the director and writers of this film were CLUELESS about making any kind of a decent film. I mean ALICIA SILVERSTONE has got to give one of the worst acting performances ever in a movie as does the rest of the lame-brained cast. So my advice is skip CLUELESS I know I wished I had!!!$LABEL$0
Bork has written a mediocre book.... Bork is, of course, extraordinarily conservative (nearlyreactionary) and some of his proposals might be a frightto the more liberally inclined. A return of censorship andabolishing the constitutional review of the Supreme Courtare two suggestions; others are just as serious and justas deeply conservative. Bork clearly has deeply feltconvictions. He is passionate rather than objective. Someof his psycho-analyses of what secretly motivates liberalismare rather silly...$LABEL$0

Excellent!. By far Nirvana's best work. I'd have to go with Lithium as being my favorite song at least on this CD. It's a combination of their sad sounding and loud rock n' roll styles. Otherwise the songs in this CD are pretty much divided into 2 categories which is how i usually classfiy Nirvana: Loud fast rock, or Slow quiet. If you've never heard much Nirvana and would like to see how you like it I guarantee you'll like at least something on this CD. If you're a fan of Nirvana already and don't already have it, you're insane.$LABEL$1
Doesn't Work. Sad to say, this pump just would not fill my bike tires. It's a great size and weight and actually kind of cute, lol, but it won't attach to the Schrader valves on my bike tires. Very disappointing, I was really looking forward to having this on my bike rides. I have a small no name brand inexpensive portable pump that is many years old but works like a champ I keep with my Dutch bike. I will try the Lezine Pressure Drive Hand Pump sold on Amazon for my Hybrid. I would definitely not recommend this pump although some reviewers sure seem happy with it.$LABEL$0

Good but.... I love the episodes on this disc, but the audio quality leaves much to be desired. Ticks and pops mar each program, not what one expects from DVD. A second copy of the disc displayed the same malady, in identical spots. Popping noises plague the first half of Volume 2 as well. As Cartman might say, "Man, this s***s!"$LABEL$1
Drama at Eyam. Having visited Eyam, the Plague Village, Brooks described Anna's town and the spread of disease in the village with right amount of creepiness I felt at the real village. The simple prose has been admonished by some reviewers as poor description and character building, asking for more flowery language. First of all, this book is about the plague and from the perspective of a simple woman--not a noble woman with delicate sensibilities. I appreciated the down to earth style of writing, as the character, Anna, appears to be a `down to earth' kind of woman. She is an incredibly strong character, even though she demonstrates some poor judgement with her choice of lover--but haven't we all made poor life decisions? True, the ending of the book is rather farfetched for the time period , but the book is still an entertaining read.$LABEL$1
Junk. Don't buy.. This product has a "smart" knob that's supposed to control tuning and volume. It didn't work well when I first unpacked it, then it stopped working completely. Now we have one station and the volume turned way up and no way to change it. I'm online buying a new one now. THIS IS JUNK. Don't buy this product.$LABEL$0
Extremely LOUD!. I have had a smaller KitchenAid mixer for many years and love it. I couldn't wait to get a larger one in order to make larger batches of bread.

WAY over-the-top. sir, may i have another explosion please!. thank god i got this as an xmas gift from my nephew. i would of been pissed if i spent even a penny on this one. my brother stormed out of the room 30 minutes into the movie on xmas day. well, at least my nephew (his son) liked it! i hung in there for the entire show out of courtesy to my nephew. otherwise, i was right behind my brother. yeah i know...it's an action movie. what did you expect? i guess i am just getting too old for films that have these endless smash, bang, boom, pow, crash scenes. i won't even bother listing any details except to say................save your money.$LABEL$0
Awful. I'm normally very cautious when purchasing new hardware and I always shop around for the best deals. In this case, though, I rushed in like a fool and bought this for $50 at Office Depot b/c I really needed Internet access at my new place.This adapter is horrible. It's supposed to get a very strong signal from where I am, but its signal strength is always low when plugged directly into my motherboard. When plugged into a USB 2.0 extension cable, I get very good or excellent signal strength, but it will often lose the signal when under heavy load. This is incredibly frustrating when I want to watch a streaming video, access multiple websites at once, or game. It also runs VERY hot with nothing in the way of keeping it cool. Horrible.$LABEL$0
You have GOT to be kidding.... ....The Rudolph special being sold here is definitely ... a "hipper, cooler" yet woefully inadequate sequel. To be fair, I haven't seen this 'movie' yet. However, based on the past dreck that GoodTimes Entertainment has slopped on the table (the feature-length Rudolph they produced was enough to make even the most clueless animation fan gag), I can't imagine that this offering could be any better. I suppose that their earlier Rudolph taught them a lesson which is why the appearance of the classic characters can be seen here. But computer animation? And a pink hippo? Haven't these execs learned anything?!? You want us to buy this garbage? Fine. Spend some time to craft a STORY that stands on its own and hire a good team of stop-motion animators to do some solid work. There's a reason that the 60's style specials are still so popular today, guys, and it's not because of whiz-bang special effects. Think about it. Sheesh.$LABEL$0

So much unrealized potential.... Left Behind was one of the most amazing books I have ever read. What was so amazing about it was that it was Christian and yet it was still QUALITY. I cannot say the same for the film. The film tries HARD but misses the mark. Kirk Cameron puts in a decent performance as Buck Williams and Chloe is also played well.... but Rayford Steele? Who is this guy? It is one of the WORST performances I have ever seen in my life. I laughed out loud as he delivered some of his lines. For someone who was supposed to have just met the Creator of heaven and earth, he was surprisingly stoic...I could go on... but why? The filmmakers tried. It wasn't a complete waste, but if you haven't read the book, prepare to be LOST. They crammed 400 pages into 95 minutes... I gave them two stars for trying. Just because something is Christian doesn't mean it's quality.$LABEL$0

The Red King. To the reader,The Red King is not entirely interesting, in fact its not interesting at all. This book is based around a girl who can do everything (well almost everything) nothing stops her. A greedy thief takes her forcefully under his wing, she is a slave. She is offered freedom (for a price). The once pleasant Red King is causing harm to those who don't obey him.Classic fantasy. Good guy joins with relatively good guy, they cross lands together so as to thwart the evil "baddy" who is not as evil as they thought. People die, people get hurt, people are happy etc.I would have thought Victor (with the reputation he has) could surely do better than this. I expect that he didn't take too long to do this book. If he did he has wasted his time.Sorry to spoil it, but the ending is hopeless.$LABEL$0

Great album. I like so many other devoted incubus fans thought this was one of their worst cds the first time I listened to it. I puit it away for a while and just listened to Morning View and Make Yourself, two of my personal favs. About two months later i rediscovered ACLOTM, and slowly began to realize just how amazing it really is. All of the songs are awesome, especially Smile Lines, Here in My Room, Beware Criminal and Sick Sad Little World. To all of those fans who think this album is garbage or even mediocre, I offer one piece of advice...Listen again, it only gets better, and by the sixth or seventh time, you'll love it.$LABEL$1

A great butt kicker. This is the cardio sister of no more trouble zones. This workout runs a little over 50 minutes. This video requires no weights and is largely targeted at cardio conditioning and body toning. I have used this video for months and it continues to be one of my favorites because it is a fabulous workout for those of us in pretty decent physical shape. The workout is based on 6 minute circuits that each center on different sections of the body. This one will make you sweat and feel fantastic at the end. There are modifications for beginners through advanced.Its hard to find workouts that are not too easy and boring. If you are looking for a more challenging video, this is a great choice.$LABEL$1
Great watch for the price. This is a great watch considering what you pay for it. It's a little small for my taste, but you can read the hour easily. The specs says it's 43mm, but mine is 39mm.

The bright hands lasts at least two hours in the dark (they last more, but with much less bright).The packaging is awesome.The transparent back is great.The self winding system works great.Finally, I'm happy with this watch.$LABEL$1

Sgt. Pepper. Far, far, far from the best album ever made. People say it captures the feel of 1967 psychedelia, but not as well as Hendrix's "Are You Experienced" or Cream's "Disraeli Gears". People say it is the world's greatest concept album, but it's not even in the same league as Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon".The fact is that there are some good songs here (A Day in the Life, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) and some poor songs as well (Within You Without You, When I'm 64, With A Little Help From My Friends, Fixing A Hole). Average them all out and you get a slightly below average album. 2-stars$LABEL$0
neat. I just got it today in the mail and tried it out and I must say it's pretty nifty. It's a little hassle setting it up though; clamping it to a table and adjusting the peeler blade for the peeling depth. Also the size of it, especially for an apple peeler is kind of rediculous and storing it with your other kitchen utensils might be a little inconvenient but overall it's worth it's price.$LABEL$1

good idea, poorly executed. The Wrap worked great for me for the first couple years of use, though the plastic that houses the key and remote is of poor quality and started to fall apart after several months. No big deal, the key still worked. Until... last week, the lock somehow jammed, and I was unable to unlock the Wrap from my steering wheel. I struggled with it for quite some time and even called the 1-800 number on the key. Of course, no one answered. I left a message in a panic, and, of course, no one returned my call. The only way to remove the Wrap was to cut it open and dismantle the lock. The bf brought out his drill and chipped away at the metal and plastic. About an hour later, with a mess of metal and plastic shavings blanketing the car's interior, we removed the Wrap. Overall, a horrible experience. I would never recommend the Wrap to anyone and am searching for a new security device. Suggestions?$LABEL$0

Waste of time and money. I have to wonder if the reviewers that gave this DVD a good rating saw the same one I did. The animation is cheesy, the comedy is beyond lame, and the characters are downright annoying. The basic idea is great and it's a shame it was handled so poorly. The shows look like half the scenes were chopped out and what remained was cut to the bare bone. I'd have given it one star except that I reserve that rating for truly horrendous examples of defective wares foisted on an unsuspecting public. My advice? Spend your money elsewhere.$LABEL$0
Great effort from programmers, but no fun!. This game should be a part of the basic training to submarine new members. It has so much details that had spoilt the fun of the game.

Excellent Execution of Celtic New Age Masterpiece. An excellent offering which merges a modern celtic sound with rich audio imagery of mythical fantasy world. Dunning's vibrant flute and Johnson's ability to merge eclectic instrumentation into a seemless whole make each track come to life, and tell a story of high-adventure.I can honestly say I wasn't disappointed with a single track. This was one of those recordings I picked up on a whim, and has resided in my cd player ever since. Can't wait for another collaboration.$LABEL$1

Loud and Ineffective. I should have known better, because portable air conditioners have such a bad reputation... but I needed to use one thanks to an odd (and unchangable) window configuration. So I trusted that Sears (which sells this model for $499) wouldn't steer me wrong. Shame on me. I should have paid attention to the Consumer Reports reviews -- and now you should pay attention to mind: The unit is entirely inadequate for cooling a 12 by 18 foot room... and it is LOUD. The sales information touts it as "quiet," but you won't be able to sleep in a room with it. The internal "evaporator" recycles water over the cooling coils, and the pump that does that makes an annoying whirring sound that'll drive a sane person batty. Yikes. I made a mistake buying this clunker. Time to soak up the 15% restocking fee and get this thing back to Sears.$LABEL$0

Far fetched at best. I too bought this book because of its link to Michael Jackson's life. I was rather surprised at the trauma and life experiences in this woman's life. It is hard to believe that this book is an actual account of the events of one woman's life. It is mainly about her strange abusive obession with a man who stayed present in her life for many years. The book was tagged as though it had a Michael Jackson connection, but her relationship to him was only mentioned in passing. The whole story seemed a bit far fetched.$LABEL$0

This is the absolute worste movie I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!. My God this movie is horrible. Please people DONT buy or even rent this movie. And if you don't believe me just look at all the other reviews. There is no plot what so ever, the acting is really bad( actors not too attractive either), you can't even make out the murder scenes, the film quality is extremely bad, digital quality is extremely bad( and i don't mean that as a matter of option, i mean its bad for anybodies standards), the music is not timed right, and just an overall disaster. Hey, I know that alot of B-Movies were bad, but I didn't think I'd ever see one this bad. So please if your looking for a good slasher flick pick something else.$LABEL$0
silly. This book was just plain silly. The plot was about a woman who thought that she could pretend to be her twin sister that she NEVER met. When people were suspicious of her she believed that it was because they had something to do with her sisters disappearance. It never once occured to her that people were suspicious because she did a crappy job of trying to be her sister. Turns out just about everyone who was close to the sister knew all along. Why they all pretended not to know comes out later. Most of it in invovles her being manipulated by her new found father who she forgives immediately for keeping her sister but putting her up for adoption. Ms Summers also does a very boring job writing in first person.$LABEL$0
what could be better!. This is the book i have waited for; it has authoritative essays on the critical conditions of Shakespeare's art.

Disappointing. Having read all the glowing reviews about this series I shelled out quite a bit to buy the videos and get them shipped to me in Australia. I shouldn't have bothered. The programmes are so disjointed and badly put together. (Eg, we hear about one colour, jump to two separate topics, come back to another colour five minutes later, jump to a completely separate topic, etc) The constant talking is SO grating, too. My toddler refuses to watch them and I too find them confusing and annoying.

DO NOT PURCHASE!!!. I bought this product for my boyfriend who has been shaving his head for eight years. He likes the buzz-cut look, so he shaves using no attachments. This product wouldn't even cut his hair the first time he tried to use it where as his old Conair one was still going strong. To make matters worse, it cost me almost ten dollars to ship it back to Amazon because it's so heavy. A Christmas gift disappointment and overall pain in the...$LABEL$0
sharp but WEAK. The 10 degree angle to the handle and the incredibly sharp blade make for great slicing. However, within a week of use, the blade got a chip in it and started to rust around the damage. We never dropped it but did put it in the sink with other dishes to hand wash. So be warned this knife is incredibly fragile. If you treat your knives like delicate artwork, this knife is for you. If you expect your knife to be a tool that holds up to mild use, stay away.$LABEL$0
Not what I expected. I have never seen a real owl with pink feathers. However, this owl has them. The motion sensors are not effective. Seldom do they work. Most of the time, the sensors do not detect near-by motion. I would not recommend this product simply because it does not function effectively.$LABEL$0
All over the road on acid. I had a problem with this film. The film is based on short stories by Denis Johnson. The movie should have been more shorts with different characters. The flow of it makes you lose characters you grow accustomed to, the drugged out hospital orderly, the AA woman etc, even the Amish women he is involved with in his own way doesn't really evolve the way it should. There are many classic and memorable scenes to enjoy. The ER scene where the two characters get wacked on hospital drugs then have to deal with an emergency is extremely well done. The rest is a mixed bag, shaken not stirred of drug abuse, death and perhaps redumption. I'm sure the book of the same name is a much more valuable purchase.$LABEL$0
Too much emphasis on theory, not enough hands on. The beginning of the ninth chapter is over 200 pages into the book and it begins like this. "Many people who read reference manuals such as this one often want to start "doing" right away, rather than read through the explanations until a complete understanding is in place beforetaking any action." Anyone who reads through the first 8 chapters will have become more than just a little impatient at the repetitive and long winded theoretical concepts that could have been scaled down to 2 chapters. Building on a theoritcal foundation is essential. However, way too much time and energy is focused in this area IMO.$LABEL$0
Hybrid does it again!. Once again, Hybrid drops another spectacular album. Teaming w/the washington orchestra the two boys from wales drop one of their best albums yet. (i would have to say wide angle is still the best) however, since i started spinning back in 97, hybrid has been at the top of my list for their innovative sound. Hyrbid steps away from the mainstream breaks movement to deliver a solid, techy, progressive break album with incredible vocals and synths!!! A must have for any break junkie or electronic music lover!$LABEL$1
Reset, Reset, Reset. I use to own a Linksys router but I found myself having to reset it more than actual use. I have three computers and a VoIP phone system and it was very unreliable. I also work for a major cable company in customer care and Linksys routers generate a lot of calls for us because customers think it's their internet service and it's not. I replaced mine with a Belkin and haven't had to reset it once in 6 months. I just think you get what you pay for. Yes, another brand may be more expensive but the consistant connection is far more important than price. Not to mention that Linksys customer service department is in another country (good luck getting comprehensive help.)$LABEL$0

Dissapointing!. I own an outstanding '50 Mystery Classics' where almost every movies was watchable. By contrast, '50 Hollywood Legends' contains was below average collection of movies that I would not want to waste my time on.

explains key ideas. In a relatively compact book, Diwekar manages to give detailed explanations of key methods in modern optimisation. These include simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. The former are inspired by ideas in statistical mechanics, and the latter by evolution.Monte Carlo sampling is another important idea well described here. It uses a pseudo-random number generator that approximates a uniform distribution over [0,1] to do probabilistic analysis in the common case when analytic answers are unavailable.The narrative gives the reader an appreciation of what problems these methods can be used against, and also of the computational complexity of each method.$LABEL$1
Good, but not as good as the previous books in the series. I just reread this after rereading the other two books in the series. This was still very good, but I didn't like it quite as much as the first two books. I thought it dragged in places despite being a short book, and I wasn't terribly satisfied with the ending.However, it's still very good, and obviously a must read if you already read the previous books.$LABEL$1
At Last Available. Finally this masterpiece is available. It wasn't ever on VHS. LADIES IN RETIREMENT has one memorable line. "Once you sell your soul to the devil, it's so much easier the second time. The way that it's delivered by Ms. Ida Lupino you'll never forget it. She was probably the most under rated actress in Hollywood history. She was just brilliant in this. Ida conveyed many varied emotions quite well. How she was not nominated for an OSCAR, I'll never know? The plot to me is quite believable but still entertaining. With today's movies, the plot goes over the top too often. Lupino is forced. to to do something horrible and then regrets it. The way the story unravels it's logical and satisfying. TCM does show this but its worth owning. They should put it in their essentials show. Maybe Ida Lupino was not a better actress than either of the Hepburns or Bette Davis, but they weren't any better than she was.$LABEL$1

If it was the truth, it would not have been published.. As the title of this review states, if this was whole truth behind the Roswell incident, the powers that be would not have let this book be published.I believe this book may contain kernels of truth scattered here & there but the potential to spread misinformation through a book such as this is enormous. I'm sure those truly in the know (no, I am not a mad conspiracy theorist!) are always glad when books such as this one are published as they help to further muddy the water and keep us ignorant of what's really happening in this world.An OK book but not the "truth", I think.$LABEL$0
It leaked and caused floor damage. My Watts "Floodsafe" washing machine hose leaked within a few months. It put out a fine spray during the fill cycle that was sufficient to moisten the dry wall and leak into the sub-floor but not sufficient to leave a puddle on the floor where I could see it. Within four months of installing this hose, I had over $6000 of damage to my walls and floors!$LABEL$0
War Shooter At Its Best. Another great game in the Call of Duty series. I couldn't get enough of this game! The storyline is very realistic and historically accurate.

Wilco emperor clothes. Am i missing something here? All i'm hearing is a bunch of bland country pop songs with a peppering of ambient electronica over the top.

Unbelievable plot and cover. Too much coincidence in this book to make a believable plot- one character just happening to get a postcard after decades, no one recognizing a character when she returns to her hometown and attends her own memorial service, etc.I read the hard cover and realized the cover designer never read the book or would have depicted the blue bottle in the title differently and would never have included a beach photo as the girls never went to the beach together.$LABEL$0

This isn't Jane Austen!. extremely bad production of probably one of Austen's best written, if not most likeable books. The names and a few of the basic plot points are the same, but other than that, there's no similarities. They made Sir Thomas, who was basically a good man, although somewhat reserved and unbending, into a borderline lecher, they tried to mix Fanny Price and Jane Austen, and I don't think there was much of Fanny in Jane Austen. Also, what was with Mary Crawford practically trying to seduce Fanny? Completely unnecessary. The one redeeming point was the portrayal of Fanny and Edmund's relationship.$LABEL$0

Sales are not indicative of how great this album is!. This album may not have sold particularly well, but it is his best collection of songs in his career thus far. It's a real shame that Decca folded. This album has a ton of great songs on it. I like the songs "Better Than It Used To Be", "Happy As We Wanna Be", and "She's Got Everything Money Can't Buy". The best songs on the album, however, are "More Than Everything", "What Livin's All About" (and yes, Lovin's what livin IS all about), and the killer finale, "The Rest Of Forever", a beautiful song about two broken hearts who have to learn how to trust in love again, which is never easy to do. With the exception of "I'll Be Right Here Lovin' You", which is extremely corny, this is a great album from start to finish. Get another record deal, Rhett. Your fans want to hear more from you!$LABEL$1
sturdy chair. I really like this chair. It is comfortable and fairly durable. I only have two complaints. The bolts holding the chair together tend to fall off if not tightened every once in a while. Also, I am 6'4'' and the chair is a little bit too short for me. Otherwise, this is the perfect chair for it's price.Update: after a couple of months of use, another bolt fell off and the mesh is ripping. I am not sure how much longer it will hold up. Maybe I am too heavy for the chair (250 lbs.).$LABEL$1
The one and only essential for the perfect Italian vacation. I am a seasoned travellor and have relied on research and travel books to enhance my travels and guide me through foreign cities. Discovering this exceptional book has changed the travel experience. Why? The guide gives you a quick overview of all of the essentials, history and sites. The difference is the following: this guide provides the travellor with the 3-D picture of every important neighborhood, with many suggested walking tours, with each site numbered for additional detailed information on subsequent pages. The travellor misses nothing because full colored pictures assist in the discovery. No other information is needed including maps and museum pamphlets. This guide allows the travellor to be self sufficient including trying use every day things such as phones, ATMs, public transportation, tipping suggesting...IT'S ALL YOU NEED!$LABEL$1
NELLY IS POSSIBLY THE WORST RAPPER EVER. i cannot believe this rubbish has gone platinum, what is this?, nelly has to be possibly the worst rapper ever to pick up a mic, in fact, calling him a rapper is an insult to rap, hes a pop artist, he has no flow, no good lyrics, he does not rap about anything meaningful or deep,he is ruining rap and making it seem like a joke, which is quickly what its becoming, nelly, along with ja rule, chingy, 50 cent, the game and all the other terrible rappers, should be banned from rapping, i cant believe nelly had the nerve to diss KRS-one, who killed him on a diss, and if krs-one was more famous, and more people heard the diss, it would have ended nellys career, like mf doom said"Viktor the director flip a script like Rob Reiner, the way a lot of dudes rhyme their name should be knob-shiner"peace$LABEL$0

Disappointed. One of the reasons that I got a Kindle was as a convenient reading device when carrying a laptop isn't practical. I have a weekend print subscription to the NY Times, and I thought that would extend to cover the Kindle version. However, unlike what I thought I read on the NY Times "Digital Subscription" web page, it turns out I have to pay for a second subscription if I want the "e-reader" version in addition to the print version.I thought about switching entirely from my print subscription to the "e-reader" subscription, but that would be a significant downgrade since the "e-reader" edition (a) is missing a LOT of articles that I enjoy (e.g. Science, Technology, David Pogue ....), and (b) is only updated daily. I've decided that I'm better served by keeping the print subscription, reading the NY Times website when I can, and canceling the Times subscription for my Kindle.In summary, the Kindle version of the NY Times is a complete failure for me.$LABEL$0
Cop Hater. Excellent read. First book I have read by McBain. Most certainly won't be the last. Enjoyed it very much indeed.$LABEL$1
Lovely. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that this book was so short. I actually made myself stop reading the first night I got it because I did not want it to end so fast.I think that the author could have written much more with the plot... a girl talking to an angel about heaven, an angel asking a girl about life on earth...there is a lot of room for discussion. The ending was very abrupt. Even so, Mr. Gaarder shares some lovely ideas through the words of Cecilia (the main character). This book had a few moments that reminded me of Sophie's World, something totally bizarre that made me literally stop, and think. I love Mr. Gaarder's style, it is almost magical.My only regret is that I read this book in just 2 nights, but I am certain I will read it again. I highly recommend it!!$LABEL$1
Full of detail but not of vision, breadth and personality.. Mr. Pitch lets us know he did too much research. He moves too specifically through the daily grind of the events without overall vision, perspective and review. More maps, drawings and military sketches would energize a slow read.$LABEL$0
a rushed work to say the least.... The Mulching of America is almost a lot of things- almost a great allegory for blind allegiance (religious, political or otherwise), almost a brilliant satire on corporate America and almost an engrossing page turner... but because it is only almost all of those things it falls far short of being anything great- especially for Harry Crews. Initially the strong premise and requisite eccentric characters draw you in but the plot of the novel never comes into complete fruition and the reader is left unfulfilled and sorely disappointed to the point of frustration.Worth the read? Yes (I give it 2.5 stars actually), just prepare yourself for abject disappointment in the end.$LABEL$0
Tragically disappointing. I can see I'm not the only one. What the heck happened here? The visual quality of one my favorite childhood movies is pathetic. The picture is so dark that most of the movie is unwatchable. I found myself not even looking at the screen, but merely listening to the dialog and shaking my head in sorrow at the ruined treasure.More, when the action gets busy, like when fire is swirling around, the picture is pixelated.Third, I counted at least four times where the content skipped or repeated. There are no scratches on the disk, and these instances did not occur during the "commercial break" parts. Gandalf's line about Mirkwood was cut off midway through his sentence, the content mysterious gone, and Bard's welcoming the dwarves to Laketown repeated twice. It's like an incompetent rip-job off YouTube.This is the lousiest conversion to DVD I have ever encountered, and it makes me so upset that anyone would put out something of this quality and expect money for it.$LABEL$0
Slow, boring, with a lot of questions left in my head!. Like the title says...this movie is very slow moving and the plot is very boring. Then when the end comes along you expect something great, but no, just a bland ending to a bland movie. Perhaps if you like to look at movies on a "deeper" level than simple entertainment you might possibly find this movie interesting. The only plus side of this was the fine acting of the character Truman Capote. He kept the annoying voice consistant throughout the film and the consistancy of lacking almost any emotion was done quite well.$LABEL$0
hot pads, hot pan holders. These are typical of these silicone pads. I have several different sizes and shapes, now. They are stiff at first, but become somewhat more pliable. The color is very nice. A nice, muted yellow, more like the fading yellow of autumn fields. They work very well for my needs - hoisting big pans full of meat or roasting vegetables. They also make nice hot pads on the cabinet top for smaller hot dishes. I really like these silicone cooking utensils for their ease of cleaning. They never have to sit around stained and crusty like my old cloth pan holders did. Just rinse, use a little soapy water when needed and dry.$LABEL$1
this kid plain sucks. Bizarre is without a doubt 1 of the worst rappers on the earth.I burned this album off my friend and dont get me wrong I wasn't offended but this guy is just sick in his lyrics.I say Bizarre is the most overrated member of D12 and he just cant rap to save his life.I'll admit the production was good but in rap I look for how good the lyrics and flow of the rapper(s) is and production is also a key factor but the rapper has to be good to make me listen and except 4 the production Bizarre has neither of these.If u want a rapper with these qualitys look at 2Pac or Method Man and get Proofs solo album Searching For Jerry Garcia instead,Proof has decent flow and lyrical content unlike Bizarre so get Proof instead$LABEL$0
this isnt a Bond movie!. First let me say i really like the new bond,I've always liked Craig,he does nothing to hurt this movie,but man what happend there has never been a bond movie I didnt like untill now,theres a good chase seen near the begining but after that its off to a poker tournament for 45min. or more..I dont understand the lack of action and the lack of any gadgets.Ok some might defend this and say well this is a new type of bond movie...I say B.S.When we watch a bond movie we like action,some hot bond girls,some gadgets and a save the world theme..With this movie you get none of that,zero.I dont understand all the great reviews,in a nutshell its really boring!$LABEL$0
A Great debut!!!. I have to say I was very undecided about buying this cd even though I liked Complicated well enough but I have to say it was so over-played on the radio. However I was definitely surprised what a great talent. I really enjoy this cd along with Complicated other great songs are: Anything but Ordinary (probably my most favorite song), Mobile, My World, Unwanted and I'm with you. She's not your run of the mill teen singer she's got talent and can write her own stuff!!!$LABEL$1
A Christmas album is supposed to be ALL holiday songs. Not more than half, not nearly all, but all. These are decent renditions of material from The Roller's first two Christmas releases, they stand as proof that Chip & Co can do their stuff live, but the finale "Going To Another Place" isn't a holiday number, it's the finale from the "Fresh Aire II" release. Granted, it makes a good, bouncy sendoff from a live show after their pensive arrangement of "Silent Night", but its very existence proves that these guys could have come up with an upbeat prog lite instrumental that isn't a remake of a traditional Christmas song (e.g. "Deck the Halls"). If they were too late to get it on the third "Christmas In the Aire", they could have made it exclusive to this release.$LABEL$1
From Dawn to Dusk: Autobiography of Judith Hubback. This is an autobiography of an early and prominent analytical psychologist in the U.K. Her life spanned much of the 20th century, and she emerged through the various changes that women went through during that century to become a well known analytical psychologist, poet,wife, mother, grandmother, and writer.The autobiography is very well written, and will interest those interested in analytical psychology and the emergence of the feminist movement in England.$LABEL$1
One of my top 5 albums. I've been listening to SR-71 for 5 years now, and their first album is still (by far) my favorite. It is the perfect mix of pop and punk - something no other band seems to have gotten right. I never get tired of this album, my favorite songs being the entertaining 'Politically Correct' and 'Alive' - a ballad of strength in the face of physical abuse. I can't say enough good things about this CD, the only disappointment is that SR-71's following albums couldn't match its calibur.$LABEL$1
Humane master of the sardonic. Jake Thackray's lyrics are literate and his music is melodic and stylish. These are not fashionable qualities but if wit and style have any meaning, this is where you come to hear them. Thackray has the audacity to suggest that women are garrulous, sex is fun and people enjoy themselves quietly in eccentric and humane ways without reference to the Social Services. I have been trying to work out why this is not folk music and all I can say is that he does not take his work seriously and he treats us like adult human beings. That is art but not the lah di dah sort..$LABEL$1
Great photos!. This book has a lot of great photos, mostly in color. The information is pretty good, but there are some areas that seem to have gaps in the narrative. I also would have liked more in-depth information relating to Hasbro instead of mostly the kind of information that you can get from a list. The book tells you when everything was released, what year, who did what, etc. But it lacks any human warmth, and there are really no warm stories of the original creators sitting together and working on GI Joe. Sadly, most of the GI Joe books totally ignore the human factor, aside from giving credit to the names of the people who designed, invented, patented, painted, funded, etc. The book is great for photos, and lots of interesting information. Sadly, it is not a warm, fuzzy book about a children's toy!$LABEL$0

Great start!. Books gives an excellent beggining point for one who would like to begin writing for the newpaper. If one reads this book and reads news articles with it, one should be able to understan newspaper format.I recomend this book for all who are interested in either writing in the future or in understanding the news article format. After taking a class with a college proffesor using this book I was able to get an article published in the college paper.$LABEL$1
Mystery, yes. Sci Fi, no.. I expected a science fiction story, therefore I was disappointed that it read more like a mystery novel, or maybe just fiction. Alan Dean Foster is an excellent writer, however, and so I enjoyed the book from that standpoint. I would have enjoyed it more if the characters and the extraordinary events they faced didn't sound like the usual melodrama that I read in the newspapers every day. Sometimes I just like to get a break from the turmoil this world is in and I am afraid this book kept me right here on planet Earth.$LABEL$1
Awww..... maaaannnnn. Honestly, my son and I really enjoyed this flick.However, the movie foreshadowed itself from the beginning (for me) but left my teen aged son wondering if I was clairvoyant. Too many times I voiced the next line in the movie to the point my boy asked me "are you sure you haven't seen this before?!?"No, just that "been there, seen that" atmosphere that pervades this film, even if it's told from a different point of view. It did have some different elements missing from stories of this type, just enough to make it enjoyable for both of us.Good, silly fun. Enjoy!$LABEL$1

Final Fantasy this ain't. Well, where do I begin? I've played many RPG's in my gaming life, but i have never come across one so unimpressive and disappointing as Grandia II. Yes, I understand that this is a port from an older version, but that's no excuse for the mundane audio and visual aspects of what could have been a decent game. This game clearly does not utilize the full potential of what the PS2 can accomplish. The voice-acting where horribly done, and the graphics appear like the lowly N64 could've pulled it off. The story wasn't that great either, and this is a key aspect in creating a good rpg. The battle system however, worked fairly well. It provides a nice change from the average "stand still, attack, move back to position, wash, rinse, repeat." It did, however, move a bit too slow for me. All in all, you're better of with the Final Fantasy series. This one's a rental.$LABEL$0
Quality is Missing. I love Martex Velllux Blankets. You could say I am addicted to them -- I have them in more than a handful of colors. But this recent purchase was way below par. The thickness of the pile is 1/2 that of my other vellux blankets, it has a weird feel -- almost sticky feel. This is not the same quality that I am used to from Martex Vellux blankets. Very disappointed -- but too much of a hassle to return it :(.$LABEL$0

Professional, predictable, and pedantic.. Starswarm was written by someone who has fabricated several pounds of novels and read even more. The plot has been used in dozens of novels and hundreds of video games and thousands of movies. Viz: Plucky youth with secret identity sneaks thru villains to find the holy grail, claim his birthright, and win the girl.In this case the hero Kip is a "prince of the blood" gone into hiding with a faithful retainer, and a "magic" helper. An ursurper is on his tail. At no time is there any suspense. At no time is any character other than a cardboard cut-out. At no time is the history and society of Kip's world other than briefly sketched in.Been there, done that, have the T-shirt.$LABEL$0

A wonderful starpoint for urban studies!. Here we have a very interesting investigation about the stories of the american cities and specially its downtowns, how they have growned, its shinning past and its following falldown. We can learn about very brilliant redevelopment projects that are intending to rebuild and to regain once again progress and live to some parts of the modern cities that have been in a great depression since long decades of desinvestments. It is very important to take in accounts the stories very well written by the authors about how the joining between public and privates forces is the only way to rebulit american ( and everywhere) abandoned downtowns!$LABEL$1

Anyone can sing, but should they?. Tom Wopat has always been a very likeable guy and to tell you the truth, I wae really looking forward to this CD considering the choice of selections. Starting with the packaging I was very impressed with the presentation. I had seen him perform on the Tonys and thought he was having a ball, if not quiet on pitch with his fellow performers. I had heard he was performing in several Broadway productions and cabarets recently and assumed he had gotten much more comfortable with singing. Unfortunatly, unlike fine wine, he has not improved with age. I would probably go see him in a play but as far as musicals go, I don't see how he could be a selling point. His voice quality has none and the delivery seems tenative and frail. The arrangements seem to be meant for a strong singer that would enhance them. The man should stick to talk shows and acting because he has now proved that anyone can sing---but should they?$LABEL$0
Quit Bashing Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas. Although this book is predictable, it is still a touching love story which is very well-written. This book reduced me to tears and reduced my mother to tears on two occasions. Just because it's predictable doesn't mean it won't suck you in and make you feel the character's emotions. If you like James Patterson, if you like stories about love, or if you just enjoy a good book, I recommend Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas.$LABEL$1

OK - but not great. OK. Frankly, I'm dissappointed. These people are supposed to be classically trained? Shame on their teachers. The amount of slurping that goes on is just plain bad! Don't they know how to hit a note on the note?? And, why are they out of tune? Every once in a while there's a sour note. They also don't blend well. And, I can't understand the Italian at all.Now, if you're a newcomer to Opera, do yourself a big favor and pass over the glitz of "rock-and-roll" opera and buy yourself a CD by Rene Fleming.$LABEL$0
A thoroughly unscientific self-serving piece of garbage. In the days of the slave trade, slave owners believed that black people were happier living as slaves in the US, than as "savages" in Africa. Budiansky has taken this idea and used it to justify the abuse of animals in factory farms.The idea that pigs or battery hens are happier living in tiny cages, so small that they cannot move, than they would be living in natural surroundings is obscene. The author has simply twisted reality to suit his own selfish needs as an unsuccessful small-scale farmer.This is a book that disgraces its publisher, let alone its author. Don't even read it for a laugh - it isn't funny.$LABEL$0
Save Your Money. After reading "Red Sun Rising" I had high expectations. This book was a big disappointment. It appears his many facts and details were presented only as a poor attempt to impress the reader with his research.$LABEL$0
need to clear something up.... I've seen several people criticizing the cover art of this book, and I think this needs clarifiction.If you read Beatrix Potter books as a child, as I did, you would have recognized immediately that the cover is a direct homage to the classic white covers of the little books. The plain white background, centered watercolor illustration, and even the title font is a faithful echo of every tale she ever published. Go check out one and see if you don't revise your opinion. I was, in fact, drawn to the book immediately BECAUSE I recognized it as a Beatrix Potter concept.Oh, and the story is a very good one, and timely. :)$LABEL$1
Understated desperation. The lengths to which people would go for survival is examined in this well acted, grim thriller. An absolutely fine example of a film made with actors, who will be stars tomorrow.$LABEL$1
Fantastic Book but the CD is a complete waste of Money. I was so impressed with the fourth Edition of the Valuation text (if you don't own it, buy it now) that I went and ordered the accompanying CD-rom thinking that it would have all the basic financial templates outlined in the book. I specifically wanted a valuation model for Banks.Whilst the model on the CD is fine for valuing non-financial companies, I HAD ALREADY DOWNLOADED IT FROM THE NET FOR FREE. Furthermore the CD didn't include a model for valuing banks - I'm going to have to build a new one from scratch.In other words, I've paid a fortune for something I had already got for free. Ironic then, that the model comes from a leading consulting company (McKinsey)...what's the saying about consultants charging a fortune to tell you things you already know (or in my case sell me things I already OWN).$LABEL$0
Fight Club, Book of the Century?. Not only is this book well written, but it makes you think and i also saw the movie 5 times. It's constructed and put together very brilliantly and Chuck Palahniuk is a talented writer. I seriously think that everybody should a least rent the movie and watch it about 3 times. Some things they say are unforgettable and it's a great script all together. I would be lying if I said it didn't deserve 5 stars. It's just flat out great.$LABEL$1
Perks of reading a crappy book. O.K., I bought this book because of all the stellar reviews on this website; (...) This MTV offering is Dawson's Creek in book form ... cliched and exaggerated to the Nth degree. Chbosky goes down the list of cliched characters like it's his life's mission - we have the gay boy who isn't sure he's gay, the lesbian, the jock, the confused but supposedly "innocent" boy and so on. There's nothing here an average high school student in America can *TRULY* relate to, I'm sorry. (...) There are MUCH better lesser-known books out there that run circles around this slush ...(...) Sorry, Charlie, but I can't recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower.$LABEL$0
Not Bad, with Time Will Come Improvement. Rubens effort on his first single isn't too bad. I would still stick with more established artists like barry white or luthor vandross when it comes to sultry soul music.

One of the worst series I have read. There are better fanfiction out there. I love sequels to pride and prejudice and own many of them. I purchased this book along with five others when she was first self publishing them.To me I felt like I had entered a history book with our beloved characters added and was sorry that I had purchased them. If you do read them my advice is to make a family tree for you to follow as there is such a lot of intermarrying and you can get lost. (cousins marrying cousins etc)The first book in the series is quite good at first but the rest are terrible and a waste of money in my opinion.She pretends to be Charlotte Collins eldest daughter giving a fly on the wall story for all to read. I cannot recommend any of the books except the first.$LABEL$0
This kit was made for beginners to understand the basics. I found the two books to be lacking in subject depth. Many times there would be a statement of fact which I knew meant nothing, but instead of following the statement of inference with the underlying facts the author would just go merrily on his way with the next subject. This collection of two books and a CD was worth about $19.95 instead of the $160 required to find out it's uslessness. If I could get my money back I would and if someone other than the authors immediate family had written in a review I would have never bought this kit. I think Microsoft Press should either rewrite this kit or take it off the market.$LABEL$0

Oh dear. As a active Mormon, I am extreemly embarressed. What were they thinking? You cannot make a decent movie from the Book of Mormon with out quite a large buget, and if you don't have one, please don't try. You'll just end up looking like idiots, like the cast and crew of this flim have proved.If you wan't to watch a movie made by mormons about mormons, go rent "The Best Two Years".Much much much worse than the cheesy 50's bible films. MUCH worse.$LABEL$0
That Was Then This Is Now. i haven't seen it yet because my English class is just now starting it, but the book is so far pretty good i think. i'm glad that ponyboy's back in it. he was one of my fave characters. one of my classmates (corey) thinks it's stupid but i like it.$LABEL$0
Love to wait?. Have you ever gotten home and wanted to play that one game that you just got a new code for, don't do that with this game. Unless that code makes the game load faster this game is annoying. If this was the first game I played on the PS2 I would have returned the PS2, and gotten a Game Cube or X Box. The graphics are not that great, and I hate the controls. When controlling Crash you feel like you are in a BMW M5 convertible that can only go a top speed of 30mph because of an engine problem. Everything about this game is slow. I wonder if the people who made this game were slow in the head. Other than that the game is fun. It is another Crash game, nothing special. But the loading kills the fun.$LABEL$0
Simple Clear - but info is avaible in other places ?. This book does a great job describing the mechanical part of homebrewing. It's well written and well illustrated, but is it useful? Most of this information is avaible somewhere online - in home brew forums - drawings and all - For Free. It's a good book - but it was origninally written in 1961 !! My reprint is from 1996 - `96 is the begining of the internet - when you still had to buy books to get most info.? Simple research on the internet will save you some money.$LABEL$0

Don't spend the money. I couldn't get past the first few pages and wish I had taken the time to read the reviews of this mean spirited, pompous, derogatory spew from this writer before spending my money. With the daily partisan hatred being flung from the halls of Congress, I didn't need to read it when I was trying to "unwind" with what was falsely marketed as a "hilarious account of one man's rediscovery of America." Hilarious?? Rediscovery of America?? Nothing funny about it. Go back to England, Mr. Bryson!$LABEL$0

Absolutely disapointing!!!!!!. I was hopeing this would be a well written book on the leadership and style of Jack Welch. It turned out to be a pep rally on what great things Jack did. Somehow it would have been better if I went to the local high school rally than sit through this book. I didn't even finish the first couple of chapters before I put it on the shelf. Should have returned it. I wouldn't recomend this bood to anyone who enjoys reading books on leadership.$LABEL$0

Book - Practical Wireless Telegraphy E. E. Bucher (1917). In the era this book was written there were NO transistors, tubes were just starting to be used and the only known bands were above the 200 meter band. Most transmissions were in the 600 meter band. "Welding Machines" were transmitters that is a spark with some interesting methods of generating one and tuning circuits were used to more or less (by todays standards mostly less) control the output frequency. The crystal set was king, few if any had the latest and greatest regenerative sets (patent 1914). For the crystal set enthusiast this is a goldmine of ideas and understanding of very early radio.I would reccomend this book to the crystal set enthusiast or anyone with an interest in early radio. The transmitter circuits are Extremely Dangerous as well as illegal.$LABEL$1
Orb Toilet Paper Holder. This item is a bit flimsier than I was expecting and it narrows down at the bottom so the new bigger Costco toilet paper rolls don't quite fit all the way to the bottom without jamming it in fairly hard.

Waste of money.... This movie [is weak]! I have no problem with the twisted and grusome violence in this movie, but the movie REALLY REALLY [was weak]! First of all, the plot: There isent any, this movie is about some stupid kids running out of gas, and guess what happends! Second, the violence: No as gory or bloody as the rumor wants it, but the killer-scenes are twisted and grusome.

best books ever!!!!. ok, I know some of you think that these books are pointless and innapropriate. Now, I usually love reading hard-hitting novel and autobiographies! Stories that retell major events in history used t be all I read. But after a while, its fun to just sit back and enjoy nice light reading. These book are sooooooo perfect for that. they are so funny and this latest one is just halarious! I couldn't put it down, and read all 8 books, plus the amzing spin-off book, "the it girl" (starring jenny) in 3 days! you absolutley have to read these books! they are a must for vacationing, long car rides, or just sitting around at home!

Look at another computer. I was excited about this computer for the price. When I received it everything seemed great. It was a bit more complicated than I wanted to tackle so I took it to a local bike shop to install for me. When they got it installed it would not read the sensor. I changed both batteries out and it still would not read the sensor. I ended up buying another more expensive model that works just fine. This is larger than most bike computers and doesn't feel as well made as any of the others I have seen, very light weight plastic. This item was returned within a couple of days from purchasing it.$LABEL$0

Nuts & Bolts Advice for the Divorcing. Divorce ranks as one of the most stressful events you can go through in a lifetime, even when it's fairly amicable, and many aren't. Even though your emotions are in turmoil, you have to be as objective as possible when going through a divorce to ensure that you (and your kids, if you have any) get a fair deal.Brette McWhorter Sember's book not only goes over every aspect involved in divorce, but provides practical, useful worksheets to help you stay organized. She provides tips on gathering, organizing and analyzing financial, household and personal documents and walks you through the divorce process. The book lays out the different options for working with lawyers, mediators and what happens in court.Anyone involved in a divorce would do well to order this book as soon as the decision is made to divorce.$LABEL$1
Must read after the loss of a child. My 25 year old son was killed in a motorcycle accident almost three years ago. There's no way to understand the shock and pain a parent feels with this type of loss, unless you've experienced it. Our daughter bought "Beyond Tears" for me, I could only read one or two pages at a time because these dear women were describing my pain - I was reading what I was feeling. It helped me to understand and know that I wasn't losing my mind or going crazy. I continued reading books (22 at the last count) but, Beyond Tears was by far the most helpful. I've recommended it to those who sadly have found themselves dealing with the death of a teen or adult child.$LABEL$1

It works well. I did have a little trouble with the button that is supposed to raise the brushes, but after writing to the company they explained how to do it. And it worked!

The hose attachment could definitely be longer- but it does the job! All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.$LABEL$1
Poor attempt at a sports worthy mp3 player.. I bought one at Costco, and ended up returning it (thanks to their excellent return policy). Here are my thoughts:1) It's pricey, and for the money the included headphones do not fit well, and fall off in sports activities.2) The battery life is very short.3) The clock/date resets when you change batteries!4) The controls are very easy to accidentally hit in sports activity.5) No crossfading of songs6) The FM radio is difficult to use, and has poor reception.And finally,7) It may look rugged, but despite the fact that it is even in a padded belt clip, falling just 3 feet onto a carpeted floor made it break. Not very good for sports, eh?In short, I cannot recommend this unit for it's intended purpose of a sports mp3 player.A$LABEL$0

Klaus Nomi was a brilliant singer. This retro of Klaus, the operatic sonic wonder from Germany elicits high drama as well as self humor. His germanic tenor radiates and casts it's spell. I knew Klaus in the east village in the early 80's. I found him visually amazing, and had the fortune of being serenaded in his apt. He sang the great Dietrich song, "Falling in LOve", and his anthem "Total Eclipse". He was an original, silenced too early...a brilliant non-comformist!!Thanks to Hrry Young for the notes on his interesting life in NY.$LABEL$1

Frustrated. My son saved his money up to purchase this trumpet. He currently plays 6 different instruments, he wants to learn as many as he can. He purchased this with the knowledge that it was a "student" type trumpet, not like what we get from a professional store. The trumpet comes, everything looks great, even sounds good when he plays it but the valves are sticking, which is something that happens, hence the need for valve oil. He keeps oiling it and it will continue to stick, bad. Took it to our local music store for advice and they said this was made in China, the parts are not "stock" and we will not work on it and it will be hard to find anyone who will. My son is extremely frustrated because the instrument looks great and sounds great, but he can not play with out stopping to wait for the valve to pop back up! My advice, get one that is not made in china so you can have it fixed if something doesn't work! If we could find someone to fix it, there would be no problems!$LABEL$0
Not for Beginners. I bought this DVD, having done Pilates before. I found that it moves very fast and is not for those who don't already know pilates moves. Her counting on the voice-over doesn't always match up with the demonstrations. There aren't any variations for movements if they are too difficult (especially for moms that have virtually no ab muscles after giving birth). There is nothing that makes this video specifically for the post-natal period. You may just as well get a Windsor video, which does more explaining with the moves.$LABEL$0
For the Ultimate fan!!! But where's Patrick Swayze???. This is a great edition of the classic Dirty Dancing. It has a TON of special features including music videos of the 3 most popular songs and a full length Dirty Dancing concert. And of course the regular interviews and retrospectives. I am a little disapointed however. Patrick Swayze is not interviewed AT ALL and the only actor they talk to is Jennifer Grey. I would have liked to see interview with other characters and the writer talk more about how she wrote the movie. The other disk is of course the great movie! No complaints about that. Even with some missing features, still the best edition around.$LABEL$1
Piece of junk. I bought RCA's model before this, which died before the warranty expired. I was sent this model to replace it, and it died within 5 months. RCA only recognizes a 90 day warranty on the refurbished junk it sends you after the original junk dies (or 1 year from original purchase date), so now I'm out of warranty and out of luck. RCA Customer service doesn't seem to care that they sent me two lemons, and is sticking by their policies.$LABEL$0

Pathetic Examples and multiple mistakes make this a loser!. What I'd hoped would be an excellent book to introduce me to COM and DCOM has turned out to be an exercise in futility.I've been used to the quality tutorials from WROX press and Microsoft Press where they lead you step by step through an exercise. The author's first example in Chapter 2 I did not even realize was an example until they expected me to run it in chapter 3! There were no instructions on how to create the COM client, just several lines of code. This set the tone of the book.When I tried to run the author's code examples they failed.There were also multitudinous spelling errors and discrepencies between the Figures and the instructions.Though the authors clearly know their subject, I will have to find another book if I wish to learn COM and DCOM. This book is basically worthless as far as the examples go.$LABEL$0

Maybe it just wasn't for me.. I totally loved Desert Rose and in response to one of the other reviewers this song was out long before 9/11 bombings, relax. I loved the middle eastern flair that he used in Desert Rose, and I think it opened up a lot of areas of music that have not and should have been explored previously. Now as for the rest of the album, well, it just wasn't for me. It's not bad but to have one song evoke so many sentiments and not have more to go along with it just leads to dissapointment. A thousand years wasn't that bad but I still wish it was more powerful and provocative. I would recommend it to someone who is a Sting fan true and through but if your intrest just got peaked by Desert Rose like mine did than just stick to the Single.$LABEL$0
My child loves it but it's really small. It's looks to me to be about 5 to 6" in length and height his body is about 2" at most is my guess. Very small... not sure I would have bought if I had it my hand to examine due to size, appears to be a quality product.$LABEL$1

The main theme is LIVING!. This book deals with day to day life problems, with the main point being LIVING! Rather than just another "disease of the week" tragedia, Judy Lynn and her "froup" tell it like it is.If you're looking for high drama, you won't find it here. What you WILL find is a book about how ordinary people, living ordinary lives, make their lives "do-able" in sometimes EXTRAordinary ways.I wish there had been something like this book around when I was seeking answers to my questions back when I was newly diagnosed. It would have saved me a lot of the fear that came from reading some of the misinformation that is still, unfortunately, out there.It's not "gloom and doom", it's not "sweetness and light", it's factual, funny, sad, and presents life with MS in the matter of fact way that this "froup" deals with it all.Thank you Judy-Lynn and online sisters!

Not Worth Your Time. Looking for a way to exercise indoors during the winter months I purchased Sweatin to the Oldies.It was a multiple disc set. The 1st disc was just Richard talking and interviews. The 2nd was moreRichard talking and interviews. By the time we got to a workout I was already not happy. I paid to sweat not listen to testimonials.Richard assumes you know the meaning of the steps he yells out. I didn't. He's got a large group of folks sweatin with him.The camera pans them so often and badly I might add that you can't follow the routine. Not all of them are doing thesame thing and when the camera does go to Richard it's his face/body and nothing of his feet.Very, very poorly instructed and filmed. Don't waste your time or money. I sent mine back. Amazon gladly refunded my money.I found a great way to exercise at home with Leslie Sansone. You get a great cardio/aerobic workout and you can find her online at Exercise TV. Not only do you get a great work out, she's free.$LABEL$0
I am satisfied. I first saw the video for "Show me how to live" on MTV about a year ago.I thought the song was excellent but hesitated about getting the cd, eventhough I love RATM. I concidered this album a poor mtv record with only one hit single and didnt want to get swindled in buying it. So, i didn't, I downloaded it. And I must say I'm not sorry. Definetly not sorry. I really think its an excellently played, sung and produced record which has enough trippy, psychedelic guitar sounds by Tom Morello and copyrigted screams by the exSoundgarden frontman Chris Cornell. And they are well put together. I am satisfied.$LABEL$1

BOYCOT this product!!. Kinda harsh heading, I know. But I am on my 2nd mouse of this particular design. Great idea! HORRIBLE design! And I think they designed it this way knowing what would happen so as to increase sales.So what happened?? The USB dongle broke both times....it's all in the design. The dongle is essentially 2 peices, and the outer peice pivots (maybe for better communication with the mouse?...nah!!). The problem with the pivoting part is that it goes so far, and then breaks. The wires BREAK internally if you go beyond that point. Did Miscrosoft implement some kind of safety stop on the housing? Of course not!!BOYCOT!!They do make another one that is one peice...I will probably exchange my broken one for this (if I can - it's been a few months).$LABEL$0
Pathetic Attempt to Cash In!. I have read both Fit For Life and Living Health, as well as Fitonics. After reaping such benefits from Fit for Life and Living Health I was anxious to learn more from Marilyn. However, I found this book to be devoid of any real diet plan or sound information. It seemed that the authors' should have written a book about meditation instead of healthy eating. I for one am unsure that I can trust a person who waffles between vegetarianism and meat eating all in the same day! I also found it very convenient that the cover of the book proudly declares Marilyn as the Co-Author of the Fit for Life books while inside the book she tears down the very principles she is displaying on her cover, talk about cashing in on the reputation Harvey built! If you are really look for a informative health book try Fit for Life, try ANYTHING else but this!$LABEL$0

alfred is awesome. I have Alfreds piano method with I enjoyed so I decided to pick up his guitar method too. I have no complaints about this book. After I played a segment of the danube waltz I knew this is my personal favorite guitar method, and I have a lot of them. There are a lot of different styles presented and explanations on basic skills I see lacking in other books like the Mel Bay series like the different muting techniques. I can't help but go back and play some of the pieces because there's something magical about bach on the electrical guitar. This book is great for beginners and will not suddenly ramp up in difficulty like A Modern Method for Guitar. Highly recommended guitar method.$LABEL$1
An insult to all bibliophiles. If you love books and Leroux's novel in paticular do not buy this book. Although the cover art promises great things, alas the illustrations remind one of a Barbie coloring book, only not as sophisticated. The less said of the butchering this line of books commonly does to great novels, the better. A much better read would be the version illustrated by Hilderbrant as the novel in itself shouldn't be beyond most young readers. For the very young try the Bullseye or Step Up chillers. Both are excellent reads.$LABEL$0

Open Theism' Roots. I bought this hoping for some good information. Only the first chapter or so is worth reading. His position that God really does not know everything and that if God cannot learn anything would make His life one of stagnation are seriously flawed. I realize that he is quoting others, but they were not worth the space.This book will not help an extreme Calvinist reexamine his position, it will only drive him further into his system. The seeds of open theism are seen in the appendices. Quite frankly I was shocked when I read the book.I hold to an unlimited atonement so I am not giving this book a bad review because of its position, but on how the case is made. I would not waste my money on this one again.$LABEL$0
Way Ahead of The Curve. Just finished Angeles Crest and i'm totally dazzled by the author's raging life-force, and depth of experience on so many levels. Mr. Modzelewski is an inspiration to us all, never satisfied with surface appearances, he is constantly taking us to exquisite depths of the human experience, especially in the realm of the spirit, reached via extreme physical tests. This book is way ahead of the curve. Not everyone will "get it" for Mr. Modzelewski goes far beyond normal experience and perceptions that have been dulled & dumbed-down in our superficial culture. The book's magic all comes from his unbounded feelings for Nature, which he expresses like a passionate lover! This is a writer and man of tremendous courage. Bravo and tres bon!$LABEL$1
Cute, but still not worth the low price. It IS extremely small, and does actually take pictures, but the quality is much worse than you would hope for, even at 640x480.

Maybe in another year or two this size and price will be a better reality.$LABEL$0
Beautiful couch throw but. This is a beautiful sofa throw but what I didn't like about it was that it only stops at the top of sofa. It's not long enough. It's great with width from arm to arm but not from feet to back. Picture yourself sitting on sofa. The throw starts at your feet, up to the seat where you sit, and goes up behind you, and then stops at the top. Sitting down alot will make that throw fall down behind you. If it was long enough to go over the back and down almost to the floor in the back of couch, I would have kept the sofa throw. They should add another 60 inches.$LABEL$0

Beatriz Montes es una cantante que destaca;tiene una voz que,aparte de ser muy linda,canta las palabras de las canciones de este CD con gran maestría y por eso volveré a escuchar las muy lindas canciones de "Amorcito Lindo" en muchas ocasiones.Las canciones de este CD me han traído mucha felicidad,y espero que quien las oiga tenga el mismo placer.$LABEL$1
Stress relief???. I ordered these because I had been reading how ingesting Kava root could produce stress relieving results. The directions say to take one capsule. If you take one capsule, you will probably not notice a damn thing. If you take four to eight of them, you feel something, but I would not call it a "stress relieving feeling." It is more of an irritating feeling if anything; it produces a kind of light-headed/headache-y feeling. In my experience with this product, I would say that it does not produce the intended results. But the same can be said for many herbs. Hell, sometimes even a strong cup of coffee won't wake you up in the morning. Point being, results are going to vary from individual to individual, but if you are really interested in this stuff, I would do a Google search for the website for the company that is based in Hawaii that also makes this stuff. They claim to produce Kava with a much higher percentage of Kavalactones.$LABEL$0
DRM, Windows only == FAIL. Given the game's draconian DRM (Digital Restrictions Management) that prevents you from legitimately installing it more than a few times, and that it does not run on anything by Windows, I cannot recommend this game at all.$LABEL$0
Perfect match. This soundtrack is perfect if u liked the movie like i did. If you listen to the songs and close your eyes you can use your imagination and watch the movie over and over agian!!

What I think of All About Love. All About Love was one of the best books in the series. It's mainly about Jessica and Will and how their relationship faltered. Liz and Connor were also a big part of the book, as this was the first book in the series when they were truly together. Melissa and Tia weren't really that much involved, although Melissa did try some techniques to get Will back.$LABEL$1

Do not buy this book.. Do not waste your money. Buy a book written by Kenneth Cohen, Honoring the Medicine, instead.Altho' I do agree that the drug industry is corrupt I do feel that this book is a sneaky way of trying to get more money out of a consumer. The author refers EVERYTHING back to his web site which requires you to spend even more money for the info that I thought was within the book!I give this book a minus 10 points. Mr. Trudeau - I want my money back.$LABEL$0

Needs Pinyin. If you want your child to learn a few things in Mandarin, this is a fun little video. However, I was hoping to use this as a teaching tool to help me and my daughter learn Mandarin together. But I was very disappointed to find there is absolutely no Pinyin whatsoever and nothing included with the DVD to supplement the lessons.The sound is not so great so you may need a Chinese/English dictionary to make your best guess as to exactly what is being said and which tone is used. The English subtitles are nice to have but simply not enough - plus there is no "word for word" translation anyway.I DO like the content and the way it's presented, but to me it needs more for clarity - especially for such a beautiful and complex language and for those of us who want to get it right.$LABEL$0

Yesterday Once More. A great collection of The Carpenters songs. Was made two years after Karen Carpenter passed away. Karen Carpenter sang and did some of the drums and Richard Carpenter played the keyboards. The brother and sister sounded great on this recording.

Failed the MPRE!. This book covered a lot of what was not on the MPRE, and very little of what was. After studying the book, I aced the practice MPRE that was provided. I went into the MPRE confident that I was going to do just as well. However, the actual MPRE bore little semblance to anything I had been prepared for. Bottom line: I'll be taking the MPRE again.

probador de bobinas basico. Este probador de bobinas de fabricacion poco ortodoxa, que mas bien parece fabricacion casera,(bueno el producto mismo dice "PATENTE PENDIENTE"). es bueno, incluso para un tecnico profesional debido a que en el mercado de las herramientas electronicas no existe producto que sea capaz de exitar las bobinas para saber si estan buenas. Y los equipos que existen son muy costosos y solo los tienen los grandes talleres. En cuanto al chispometro que viene con el probador, que es de la marca LISLE, prefiero el THEXTON 404 que trae un tubo transparente que sirve de acustico para escuchar la chispa. Es exelente para las bobinas de los vehiculos asiaticos que van dentro del distribuidor. LO RECOMIENDO !$LABEL$0
The Rip-off (an HBO Miniseries). I really, really liked Band Of Brothers so I bought this set with out hesitation and watched the whole thing in a weekend. Well, I should of checked out the reviews first. In my opinion it is pretty lame, nothing like B.O.B and for what I paid for it, it is a flat out rip-off. Learn from my mistake and rent this one first!!! You can always buy it later or buy mine for cheap!$LABEL$0
Degrassi is fantastic. I started watching Degrassi on The-N when it first came out and I was really impressed with the way they handled issues concerning teens. It's especially interesting now with the story concerning Rick. Although the acting was a bit dramatic in some cases, I was really intrigued by the storylines. I would often tell my friends (who didn't have access to the awesomeness that is The-N) about it and I got them interested too. So now I'm glad that the first season is out on DVD so I can actually show it to them. Can't wait for the other seasons to come out!$LABEL$1

Boring. One of the worst written books I have read in 2 years. The story: for hundreds of years there were a lot of people catching and eating cod, but then they were overfished and there are no longer giant stocks of cod. Now you have no reason to get this book, as the author does not add much to that sentence - but drags it out. A bunch of relatively unrelated fish facts and boring details of random fish stories - but no storytelling ability is present. Dull and repetitive.$LABEL$0
Apple Keyboard. My original apple keyboard went out and I replaced it with another brand which wasn't as nice as the apple.

Chinese sizing?. Very disappointed in this product! (Amazon, you're still great). The sizing is ridiculous. They run at least one full size small and who makes clothing anymore that when you toss the brand new shirt into the dryer on fluff to knock the wrinkles out it comes out with the sleeves a full three inches shorter than they went in? If you have very short arms and buy a size larger than you really wear you will love this product. Nuff said.$LABEL$0
Bought this pocket for my Honda DX 2000 4 Door. This holder fits in my spare space, but it's a bit too small, leaving a noticeable gap between the holder and the stereo above it. And the holder's storage area is quite narrow and it does not use up all the space that is available for it. Moreover, the material finish doesn't match the rest of the area of my car. Not quite happy with it.$LABEL$0

Canon BCI-3eBK Cartridge. This is my first time owning a computer that I was responsible for everything about it. I find that this cartridge is easy to install, but the cost is quite expensive unless you do a lot of shopping around. This item is not available at many of the discount places. I would like to know why I need to install a color cartridge to be able to use only black. I find that each cartridge (4) that the printer Canon BJC-3010 uses does not run out at the same time and gives you a warning when either color runs out and unless you install the one that's ran out the printer does not work. I did have a problem trying to usea refill kit with this item, so far I have been unable to refill it with the refill kits that is available.$LABEL$1
Supernatural Godzilla?. At first I was leery about a supernatural take on Godzilla, but then I realize--since when has Godzilla been about the plot? Not since Godzilla 1954 has a plot been relevant in a Godzilla movie, which is why this movie shines where it counts: the monster fights!GMK has some of the best daikaiju fights in the Godzilla Millennium series. It is nowhere near as good as the Gamera Heisei trilogy (Gamera:GotU, Gamera: Advent of Legion, and Gamera: Revenge of Irys) but it has Godzilla returning to his truly antagonistic roots and the return of Baragon.I only recommend this if you are a fan of Godzilla movies. If you aren't then it is only worth a rent or foryour kids.$LABEL$1

Excellent Sequel !. Wow, I was amazed when viewing Part 6. This is probably the first of the series with more thrills, humor, and of course... the return of Tommy Jarvis. Part 6: Jason Lives, should have definately been the 5th movie in the series. The movie starts off with Tommy explaining what happened to him when he was a kid (Part 4) and why he is hunting Jason. This is one of the Friday the 13th films in which you actually care about a few of the characters such as the Jarvis family in Part 4. Two other things I liked about Part 6 was Alice Cooper's "Man Behind the Mask" theme song and the fact that Part 6 doesn't refer to Part 5 which is a definate plus. I consider Part 6 a direct sequel to Part 4.$LABEL$1

The 411 on cowboys!. Find out the pertinent details of cowboys. How they live, talk, dress, and eat. Find out about stampedes, the dangers on the trail and how to catch a rustler. This is a humorously written and illustrated book all about cowboys. The details and colors in the pictures are delightful! This is great for boys and girls. I have girls and they've both loved this fun book. It's one of my favorites along with "Do Pirates Take Baths".This is one of those books my youngest daughter will pull out and ask for when she knows I'm tired and trying to get outta reading. She begs, I relent, then she says: Oh-kkaaay, how about 'Do Cowboys ride Bikes?' -and I say okay, but just this one!$LABEL$1
Not an interesting read. Author assumes she knows all about the reader's attitudes. Only one point of view is given in the book - assumes 100% Dom 100% of the time. Bad language is used in the book - the points could have been put across without using bad language. However, the best part of the book was the chapter on tools used in the trade.If this was my first book on Dom, it would have been my last since this book would have removed any / all interest. I will not keep this book in my library.$LABEL$0

Foul Ferrell. Once upon a time Saturday Night Live was funny. Now they have the occassional amusing skit and the rare standout castmember. Will Ferrell is one of those standouts. Unfortunately, this DVD doesn't do him justice. Rather than a greatest hits collection, we're provided with a random sampling of Ferrell's skits and characters. This DVD would be more aptly titled Will Ferrell's Most Mediocre Moments.$LABEL$0

An Amazing RPG. I have played a lot of RPG's but this one has to be one of the best. Even though there's not much to character customization, besides changing clothes and armor, and a couple of different hairstyles and facial hair styles to choose between, the quests are fun, and the gameplay itself is very fun, gets a little challenging at times, but whats a video game without challenge. Although it's not necessary to play this one to understand the second, there are some refrences and its overall a very good game. I also liked the level up system, not what I'm used to in other RPG's but very new and refreshing. A definite must buy for any gamers who like RPG's.$LABEL$1
Don't.. This Book is a disappointing presentation of Miss Post's guide to Doing the Right Thing. It's not formatted, as it's been scanned by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and printed without illustrations. It's just not pretty. As the book is still in print and this is not a rarity (the benefit of buying OCR books scanned from old musty gems) you should just go ahead and buy the newest edition. It'll be a much lovelier read.$LABEL$0
Beware and read between the lines. This woman will have our children taken straight from the womb to government subsidized day care facilities.

Great, but wish it were sharper. A great tool as are all OXO tools I've tried. I understand they cannot make it too sharp for safety reasons, but if it were just a little sharper it would be 5 stars. Being dull, it's safe, but requires too much pressure to push through an apple. Ironically, applying the extra pressure actually makes it less safe because it's not as stable when one has to push so hard.$LABEL$1

SHUT UP JAMES!. Someone burned this disk for me along with Rush's VAPOR TRAILS, and I thought VAPOR TRAILS was descent but this album is a piece of genuine CRAP! Jame LaBrie is a horrid singer that just screams his damn head off, and all the songs are quite lengthly and (yawn) boring. The only thing that gets this album even 1 star is Mike Portnoy's awsome drumming (I'm a drummer, you see)! If you want good drumming AND good music, here are the groups I'd recommend:Rush (Neil Peart)The Mars Volta (Jon Theodore)AND OF COURSE...Led Zepplin (John Bonham)$LABEL$0
A huge disappointment. This book might have appeal for people who haven't read any other books by Richie Tankersley Cusick, but as someone who has been a big fan ever since Fatal Secrets back in 1992, I was very disappointed by this book. It definitely wasn't up to her usual standards; the entire element of suspense was simply not there. I'm also disappointed by the fact that this author seems to have dropped off the face of the planet so far as her books are concerned, devoting time to writing up screenplays from Buffy the Vampire Slayer instead of writing her own original books. What ever happened to the book which was supposed to come out after Starstruck?$LABEL$0
Awful. This is one of my most hated textbooks. The authors assume that you will read the book cover to cover when it should be set up more as a reference text for students. I hate having to search through an entire textbook to determine what a variable stands for when it should be explained with the equation.$LABEL$0
Loved this series!. I thoroughly enjoyed all three in this series. This particular one was especially good because it wraps up the story lines of many of the characters. I particularly like that I get all the suspense and action I want in a book void of foul language. Real life still happens, just without the unneccesary garbage!$LABEL$1

Just what I needed.... Well, Dr. Briles has done it again. Her insight cuts through the usual psycho-babble and gets right to what matters most to us as human beings. This book gives us the boost we need to go out there and do what matters most to us. No more trying to meet the expectations of others first. She has really made me think and evaluate my life.$LABEL$1
Disappointment. The story sounded interesting but because this was a poem or play that was a interpretation the book was hard reading and difficult to follow. Would have been better if the author didn't have such a literal interpretation.$LABEL$0
Excellent Product. I have found the reviews of this product very helpful to determine how good this is and it is infact right. I am extremely happy with this one. The laser is very great and also the setpoint software that comes with it.$LABEL$1
is it Coal in here, or is it just me?. CC's follow up to their '99 release is amazing. It grabs you by the neck from that first chord, and doesn't let go until the last note on "Beckoned" (the last track). Try it, just tell your parents the marks on your neck are from your girlfreind.$LABEL$1
Good book for runners of all types. I am still reading this book but what I have read so far has been good. In addition to running, I enjoy biking, swimming and working out so some of the aspects of this book as far as weekly milage and the number of running workouts just can't be fit in with the other sports I enjoy. However, I feel this book will help me to be a better and faster runner even if I do have to modify the amount of time and runs recommended.For those who only run; whether a 5k runner or a marathon runner, I think this book has relevant and easy to understand information that will benefit anyone who reads it.$LABEL$1
For Olive Skin, Not Brown. I bought this based on a rec from a youtube user ad after consulting the Joe Blasco website in an effort to cover dark circles. This is too light.

Classic Shreds, some issues with this album. I'm shocked to find these on Amazon - it was hard enough to find the Lorries in the 80's in an alt-friendly southern California - did not expect to see MP3s of the older tracks here!Highlights are Monkeys on Juice, Hold Yourself Down, Cut Down.Like another reviewer suggested, these aren't always the best recording quality. The version of "Beating My Head" is absolutely horrible, which is a shame, because the original track had some mad drums/bass syncopation going on. And a note to quality control - the MP3 of "Hold Yourself Down" is another version of "Spinning Round" - and "Regenerate" is actually "Hold Yourself Down". It's actually the same on iTunes, so maybe the publisher messed up.$LABEL$1

Avoid - terrible controls. Purchased for my 4yo son.I didn't realize before buying it that it does not have traditional "forward back" + "left right" control sticks. My fault probably, but I missed that.- One stick controls the left side two wheels and the other stick controls the right side two wheels - kind of like a tank.- The sticks are actually on/off only - no variable speed control.- The radio control implementation has some serious reception problems as well, very patchy in whether it works or not, cuts in and out.The combination of the above three characteristics makes it extremely hard to drive for me, never mind my son. Basically a waste of money, he never touches it.It does appear fairly durable, and might be fun outside, but given the control difficulty we didn't even bother.$LABEL$0
Low cost, works excellent. With one C sized battery this will munch up you small little fuzz knobs off of all of your clothing without damaging the item, and with no effort.

weak album. like most soundtracks this one is not good as well. (i always regret buying sountracks.) on this album, the beatz are too tacky, and high profile, mainstream rappers put out an weak performance(dmx, luniz, daz, tray d, mo thugs/lazy bone). a disappointment. a few underground acts tried to rip the tracks, but the tunes and beats just couldn't take it there. And vocal/rap arrangements were stupidly produced.(eg: corny choruses, hooks and intros etc.) the saving grace of the album is "Survive" by Snoop dogg and Da Products. probably the only solid cut on this soundtrack. and the highlights of this album was The Lox and Eve with the song"Shotgun Style", and the other "aiight/ok"joints are "Better way" and "Playa Style". out of 19 tracks, not even half the album is listenable. Overrall, to sum it up, a dissapointment and a very lacking album.$LABEL$0
A lot of fun. Took a chance on this series and I was pleasantly surprised. In fact watched the whole first season in 2 days.$LABEL$1
A Terrible Idea, Executed Flawlessly. Some music does not translate well. For instance, the triumphant marches of John Phillip Souza do not sound good when played on the harp. And the songs from the soundtrack of Barbra Streisand's Yentl lose a certain something when performed by second-graders equipped with nothing but bones and soup.Yet this sort of infallible logic has been lost on the dunderheads who decided to play the driving rock of U2 on classical string instruments.For the same reason you don't want to hear La Boheme performed by Yngwie Malmsteen and a heard of famished yaks, believe me, you don't want to hear this album.$LABEL$0

What a fun book!. All my kids (4,7, & 9 yrs) loved this book! We especially enjoyed the rhyming text. Even so the text was extensive enough to tell a full story. In general, most pages have many lines of text. We read it as a Five in a Row book, but I am sure it will be a requested book for years to come. We were able to talk about many side issues including cakes, yeast, consequences, calories, catapults, castles, alliteration, complementary colors. The duchess decides to make a "lovely, light, luscious, delectable" cake but doesn't accept any advice or follow any instructions. As a result, she puts everything in it and way too much yeast! She sits on it and rises high in the sky unable to get down. It sounds rather silly but it is very well written and was a worthwhile purchase.$LABEL$1
A Little Heavy on the Spearmint. I bought this tea because I love Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, Decaf Candy Cane tea, which is only available at the holidays and I thought it would be a close match. It is close, but it has more spearmint and less peppermint than I would have preferred.$LABEL$1
Great Sound/Great Value. These speakers are a great buy. I mounted them using the provided mounting brackets in the ceiling of a screened in porch.

It's a stupid movie!. Nothing great about this sequel. At least the girl he falls for is hot. I like that girl Gina but this movie is so ridiculous. I don't know what's up with the good reviews.

Stick with Pee-wee's Big Adventure.$LABEL$0
In Love with the Whisker!. This is such a great and quality product. Even though the wires on the upper end are not crossing over each other but its sturdy enough not to bend.

Hahahahahah Yes!. Oh man, not only did they come a day SOONER than estimated but they have exceeded my expectations. Very rich sound and I feel that the openness lets the sound waves breathe a little, which is a good thing. And noise cancelers can sound a little sterile anyway. Very attractive design. And cool languages on packaging. Worth like [...] bucks easy but so much cheaper. I will certainly buy Sennheiser again.$LABEL$1

Early Avengers with Cathy Gale. This is a six episode set of the British classic. It starts with "The White Elepahnt", an animal we do not get to see and ends with Steed inheriting a race horse in "The Trojan Horse". In between are episodes of double agents and diabolical organizations which are a staple of the Emma Peel years. Still a good taste of Honor Blackman as Cathy Gale. She is finally starting to stand up to the upstart Steed, trying to be a full parter in the dou that is finally given to Ms. Peel.Biggest down side of the DVD is the lack of features. Only production stills which are on all the A & E Avenger videos.$LABEL$1
Cheaply made. This booklight was inexpensive -- and is cheaply made. The clip came apart after only a few days.I would not recommend.$LABEL$0
Summer of Darkness. This CD is incredible. One second the lead singer is growling and screaming to no end, the next he changes it up to very good sounding singing. The guitars and drums are very interesting and catchy, and while not outwardly christian, the lyrics are thought provoking and very well written. I think the band has become alot better since their s/t album, and I think they are even better on the songs I've heard off of The Triptych. An all around well put together CD. Well worth the money.$LABEL$1
pathetic-needs head examined. I've read every word in this book and there is nothing of any use here, very shallow & absolutely clueless.$LABEL$0
A great album. The White Stripes have got to be one of the best bands I've heard in a long time. I really like "Hotel Yorba" but all the songs on this CD are good. Hotel Yorba is why I bought this CD, but I found all the songs were good, and I would recommend it highly. (For what thats worth, LOL)$LABEL$1
Bellamy Brothers "At their best". The song Redneck Girls is my favorite song out of ever song ever made I feel that when they sing this song they are talking about me! I Love it! When I am down or sad I always know I can listen to this song and it will make me feel a whole lot better!$LABEL$1
Beautiful and Sweet. What a beautiful book! The illustrations are really lovely and the pages (we have the hardback) even feeeeel good. My 21 month son LOVES this book. He enjoys the different animals and points them out by naming them and making the different sounds they make. He also looks for the baby and the daddy. My 5 year old also enjoys the book and is now playing Jut Ay with her baby brother.I'm just so delighted with this book and right after I finish this review, I'll be buying Hush! A Thai Lullabye.$LABEL$1

jewelry organizer. The Whitney Design 80-Pocket Cotton Canvas Organizer helped me organize my jewelry. Now instead of having it in many drawstring bags and small boxes, it is all in one place where I can easily see what's there and find what I want to wear. It hangs in the closet and takes very little space. It is nice quality canvas...much better quality than others I have seen in stores.$LABEL$1
not this time. I'm normally very forgiving of escapist, fun, breezy romances, but this book is seriously, even unforgivably, flawed. The cliched backgrounds of the characters (has anyone ever gone through childhood unmolested??) paired against a contrived storyline and then followed by an ending that grew progressively more ridiculous made me want to toss the book into the junk pile. Not recommended.$LABEL$0
As soundtracks go, this is a good one.. James Horner is perhaps better known for his "Aliens" and "Star Trek II/III" soundtracks. All those sound similar in theme, and Horner has managed something completely different with the "Rocketeer" soundtrack. It manages to be heroic and sort of down home at the same time, and is very pleasurable to listen to.$LABEL$1
Durable, safe, quality SD card.. I have never had any problems with SanDisk and their solid state drives, namely their SD cards. However, I must say comparing it to the SD HC cards these cards are slow!! But, I don't think it is a fault of SanDisk rather a problem with all SD cards. It is unfortunate that there are still products out their that are not compatible with SD HC cards because having to be burdened by speed, rather lack of speed, of these SD cards can make one go crazy. Regardless, this card is definitely reliable and you won't lose your data which is a definite plus and they are easy to use as they are plug and play.$LABEL$1
REAL Comfort Food. I was in Santa Monica for a month and dicovered RFD. Being vegetarian led me to the restaurant and the incedible food there, led me to purchasing the cookbook. I felt so lucky to be able to take home the secrets behind this wonderful food. One taste of any of the dishes will have you wanting more! I don't know how to explain it, but the food this book helps you to create will make you want to share it with everyone. This is a cookbook filled with recipes not only vegetarians, but for people who who just love good wholesome comfort food.$LABEL$1
A Dangerous and Misleading Pipedream. This is a sad and dangerous book. The facts based upon research and experience are overwhelming. The only successful treatment for a true alcoholic is total abstinence from alcohol. Barrett offers his readers a false hope that further experimentation at "controlled drinking" will bring different results than in the past. The worst part of offering such false hopes to those in the throes of addiction is that in their desperate state the wishful thinking contained in this tome prolongs their agony and makes a potentially perilous outcome of their situation even more possible. Time and again it has been proven by experience that "rational" recovery is a pipe dream. Carl Jung's theory of the need of a `psychic change' or `spiritual awakening' to break the cycle of addiction still stands and is proven by thousands each year.$LABEL$0

helpful is an understatement. This ambulation belt is awesome. I use it to help both my 90 year old mother and 93 year old aunt (both are wheelchair bound). Transferring them with the help of this belt has been so much easier than before. I wish I had found this a year ago. The belt is comfortably padded, the buckle is absolutely secure, and the many grip options make any position or movement easy to assist with. I absolutely recommend this product!$LABEL$1

At Their Most Beautiful. This album is amazing. I have not taken it out of my CD player since the day that I bought it. The songs are just so good! And the music is absolutely beautiful. It's a mezmorizing album, and definitely one of REM's best...if the THE BEST!$LABEL$1
A terrible book, strangely unhelpful and oddly organized.. As long time computer user with extensive experience with dBase, I was chagrined and frustrated with my attempts to learn Act!4 quickly with the help of this book. The author seemed to persistently overstate and elaborate on the obvious, while offering minimum assistance in the more opaque areas. Invariably, what I most wanted to know as a new user was either unavailble or relegated to a chapter nearer the book's index than its beginning. The author, annoyingly, saw fit to repeatedly suggest securing professional help in various areas...and even (and I suspect, self-servingly) cited names of pros who the reader could hire. As a teaching tool, this book is a total bust..unless I'm just not enough of a "dummy" to appreciate it. It's my first and certainly last book of the Dummy series.$LABEL$0
Hands on Christmas Story. I bought one of these for my two children a few years ago. They played with it a lot which kept their hands off my nicer nativity and also gave us an opportunity to talk about the characters in the nativity, making the Christmas story relevant to them.I work for a church and recently purchased this toy for the toddler nursery. It was a way to engage the toddlers in the story of Christmas. The toy is a quality product- much like the other Little People Products and was safe and age appropriate for the toddlers playing with the pieces. I've been very happy with the toy.$LABEL$1
Enormously clever and quite moving tale of the 20th century and what it means. A photo - literally, of three farmers on their way to a dance, taken by August Sander in 1914 - shows us the last moments before the calamitous 20th century hit western civilization full force, with atrocities and dislocation and the good and evil of the modern world. Richard Powers takes this indelible image and weaves a brilliant three-part tale: of two men looking for answers to what the picture signified, many years later, and then (as a counterpoint) the "real" story of those farmers from long ago. The less you know the better, but anyone interested in the ways the fiction can uncover the truth behind history, or restore humanity to cold facts of the past, should read this remarkable book. This was Powers' first book, years before he achieved fame and (well deserved) accolades, but he was clearly a fully formed genius from the start.$LABEL$1

Good Enough for Suspended Ceiling. I needed a one time relatively inexpensive 360 degree laser level. I happened to find this lonesome level with tripod at the local home improvement store. I didn't need it to survey oron the job contracting. Just enough to get the ceiling done.Well my ceiling is level. Perhaps within 1/8 of an inch. Had a couple blind spots but I didn't need a continuous line to locate my brackets. Only other issue is initial wobble. It needs a little time to self level. I would recommend it for the do it yourself guy who doesn't want to spend a lot of money but wants to get the job done nonetheless.$LABEL$1
boring & whiny. I didn't see a plot or a point to this book. It's incessant whining about rich people's 'lives' as the Social Elite of Manhattan. Plus, it has lines in it like 'She burgled his breath right out of his lungs.' The authors try way too hard for catty and end up sounding jealous. It was a total waste of time to read.$LABEL$0
Refused to ship despite exorbitant shipping cost. I order a lobster bake for my parent's anniversary every year. The vendor I normally use closed in the bad economy, so I tried Lobsters Online through Amazon. What a poor experience! I placed my order, putting up with the $44 shipping cost to Hawaii. Days later, I received an email telling me that they couldn't ship to the specified location. Since I do this every year, I know it's not a problem to ship lobsters to Hawaii, and for $44, they can't be taking a loss on the shipping. Nowhere on their page does it say they don't ship to Hawaii - yet they refuse to do so with no explanation. This has caused me to have to scramble to get a new, comparable gift for my parent's 40th anniversary on very short notice. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS VENDOR.$LABEL$0

Please enter a title for your review. I've heard some retarded avant-garde sparse experimental non-music in my time, but this recording reaches a new level of incomprehensible stupidity.

A Smart Film for Discerning Viewers. This film is not for the squeemish or those with short attention spans and trouble reading English subtitles. This is not a conventional war movie nor does it pretend to be. This is well written, brilliantly acted, WWII revenge fantasy. Those expecting a standard morality play with white-hatted good guys or a non-stop shoot-em-up action romp will be sorely disappointed. Those who appreciate a clever story, snappy dialogue (and lots of it), and some very brief scenes of fairly graphic war violence will be thrilled.$LABEL$1

Dissapointing. This book only gives a brief overview to the actual nuts and bolts of starting a hedge fund. Instead it spends time explaining various hedge fund strategies, risk-management approaches, and basic entity structures (what is a c-corp? what is an s-corp? what is an llc?).As someone who has started a fund in the past and is looking to start another, this book was a disappointment. If you are learning the info in this book for the first time, you probably shouldn't be starting a fund in the first place.$LABEL$0

Loving it so far. This cam works perfectly for what I need a laptop cam for. It's small, has a carrying case and is great for travel. The CCD sensor is awesome - VERY clear picture. My work area is dark and the low-lite adjustment did a great job. There are a few things I don't like this cam. The mic is ok, but not sensitive enough. The stand is ridiculous. I use this cam in meetings and I have to rotate my laptop to focus on people - wish they had a better setup. Otherwise, I love this cam so far.$LABEL$1

Over-rated. This is a pure melee game. It's unco-ordinated, plotless and the movements/controls are out of date compared to other FPS's. If you're looking for all out shooting, without much teamplay or strategy then try Unreal Tournament.For those looking for a Battlefield 1942/Vietnam type game set in the Star Wars Universe, get set to be dissapointed.Just not very playable or much fun at all once you've seen all the maps and the characters.Get it used!$LABEL$0
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone- A Great Book. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very good book. It is one of the few books that I will allow myself to read.

If you are looking for a good book and just can't find one, you should read this one- you'll love it!$LABEL$1
wake up America!. The dilemma of the colonized in search for an identity which is neither static and backward-facing, nor imposed by the worldview of the colonizer is the subject of Erdrich's Love Medicine. Her winding, free-flowing storyline mirrors her endorsement of the fluidity of family connections, one of the most significant difference between Euro-American and Ojibwa cultures. Defying the strictures of the novel, the anthology, or any other established writing style, Erdrich refuses to abide by the rules of Western traditions of fiction. A slap in the face to any notions of the superiority of such traditions, Erdrich's tales demand attention by being undeniably honest, and evoking empathy for even those characters who represent everything which is in opposition to Western culture, and zeroing in on the painful truths of America's imperialist history without subjecting the reader to a history lesson. One of the most important books on the Native American experience I've ever encountered.$LABEL$1
If you're looking for real "low carb" this isn't it. The book contains a reasonable number of recipes and lots of 'hints' that if you've done ANY reading about low carbohydrate eating, will be superfluous.The recipes run the gamut of carb counts, though I thought that the bulk of them were much higher carb than is helpful. Following the suggestions in this book and the recipes, it wouldn't be all that hard to hit 80-100++ grams of carb per day... which is simply TOO HIGH for many people who are following low carb lifestyles.Many recipes call for sugar, white flour, semi-sweet chocolate and cornstarch. Come ON... those are NOT "low carb" ingredients.This is more or less a repackaged low fat/lower cal cookbook with "low carb" thrown on the cover to try to generate some market share. My copy is being donated to a charity, it isn't worth the space on the shelf for someone interested in real "low carb" cooking.$LABEL$0
Fine if you are over level 180. First on the new graphics... I have not seen them yet as they have not been released.For all new items you must be over at least level 130 to get to the new island, except a few dungeons camped by people macroing.All patchs that have come out since release are aimed toward extream high levels. Or melee. Case in point GW quest last month. No low level could kill a pumpkin lord. The buffer was camped by a level 210 to get the goodies. This month content is all mage resistant if you are under level 150. The one new orb intrduced into the game is buged. The so called event you had to be over level 100 to attend.I have been waiting since release for a answer from their tech support on migrating problems with 2 of my accounts. They offer no support unless you want to make a long distance call.So unless you are a high level melee or very high level mage do not waste your time and money on this. It is not like the old days where they added something for everyone.$LABEL$0
Essential. This is essential reading for anyone who owns a dog that guards resources. It could prevent a child from being bitten. It could save your dog's life. The procedures in the book are based on sound theory, and they work. I do not know of any other book on the subject, so it's a good thing that this one gets it right.I adopted two strays that were aggressive resource-guarders. I worked the plan in this book, and now I think they would give up anything. I caught one of my dogs swallowing a "mystery lump" in the living room. I casually opened his jaws and removed it from the back of his throat. No complaints. It turned out to be only a cheese cube that I had dropped when making myself a sandwich. So I gave the dog a third of a weenie, and then I gave him back the cheese. I swear he looked at me like I was crazy, but he was happy with the exchange.It is a very thin book, but all the info you need is there. Buy it.$LABEL$1

Great Coat. This coat is perfect for my use. I work construction and out in the elements everyday - this coat keeps out the cold, wind and rain. If it is very cold out, I will layer a sweat shirt along with my long underwear and t-shirt. The coat being longer than the jacket, the coat keeps my lower back warm. The material was a bit stiff when first new but nothing time and wear doesn't cure. On average my Carhartt coat will last several years so well worth the money.$LABEL$1
Whose grandpa shot these things?. I agree with R. Pearson. I realize that real RR fans will probably love to see the equipment and the routes and so on. And I guess they like this set. But I'm just a guy who likes travel documentaries with a certain level of production values. And these DVDs DO NOT have production values. It looks to me like the chamber of commerce got a staffer's grandpa who volunteered to shoot these things on his old gear. They mostly look as bad as VHS tapes. The video is low-rez and jaggy-ridden. The scenery mostly looks dreary, because of the dreadful videography. A lot of stuff is shot through dirty train windows. And so on. The narration is clunky in its scripting, and the voice talent again sounds like a chamber of commerce volunteer. The canned music, ick. Even though I paid just $3 for this thing, I feel like wasted my money. Just an awful, awful set.$LABEL$0
Melvins surprise. Most people who have had encounters with the music of Melvins propably pin them down as a sort of a grungy heavy metal sludge. Therefore this album is a true surprise since this is hardly even rock. King Buzzon and co. truely display their melodic abilities here, creating some of the most moodful tunes in the last few years. Especially the first half of the album is excellent, almost haunting. Not for diehard metallers or grungefans, but for anyone willing to hear great, atmospheric music. You small type reading pinhead...$LABEL$1

Simply cannot relate to her views. I've read the first two chapters. Personally this book doesn't cut it for me. The way she sees the chakra is completely different from what I'm used to (ie: 7 levels) and she attributes different colors to them. That in itself isn't the biggest deal, but her exercises seem to require extremely specific hand positions and such things which personally (from experience) doesn't require such complex coreography.I have no doubt that what she wrote works for her and will work for someone else our there, but to me, this book isn't what I would see as a "good book to learn from". It's more of "this is my way to do it" with a laundry list of what I can do and you can do the same thing.$LABEL$0
Dinosaur Paper Chains/A Complete Kit Including 12 Stencils. This book is great for all ages. I bought the book to use with scrapbooking pages, but will also use this as an activity with kids as young as 5 years old. The stencils are large enough that a small kid can use, yet detailed enough to embellish the work that I do. The stencils are easy to cut for a youngster. The paper that is included is elegant for scrapbook pages or for a kid's project. I highly recommend this book for anyone who works with kids and likes to keep them busy. The possibilities are endless. I have seen other 'paper chain' books and they were too complicated for me let alone a kid.$LABEL$1

COMPLETE, AND UTTER WASTE OF MONEY.!!!! DONT B FOOLED!. If I could give this toy a ZERO MINUS on durability, I would. I have a 2 year old daughter for whom I bought this toy. My daughter watched it all of 20 min before she sat it on the living room table and permanent lines began to come across the screen. We took the batteries out and put them back in...same thing. Are they kidding me when they say this toy is durable for preschoolers!!! Blow your breath on the damn thing and it will skip...(see other reviews). The sound quality sucks, and really the picture isn't the best either (but both are suitable for a toddler). Apparently these toys are defective seeing how the problem appears to be across the board. No wonder this thing is no longer being sold in stores. Buy one you'll see for yourself.$LABEL$0

Very Good!!!. I wasn't sure what to expect when I was waiting for this book to arrive. When I got it, I was pleasantly surprised.

I Read it in 2 days. The day I received the book I began reading it and couldn't put it down. Every free moment, I would read it and had to force myself to put it down. It was so great to read about what heaven will be like and being greeted by all the love ones that have passed before us. I cried at the pain and angusish that Don had to endure. The limited pictures were helpful in identifing with his situation. I do wish he would have included a picture of his wonderful wife who went through this journey by his side. Thank you Don for sharing such a personal and difficult experience. Your honesty was humbling.$LABEL$1
Works great. I've been using this fairly consistently for the few weeks since I bought it. Everything works great. It seems to save the quality of the wine well.

But like I said, so far, no problems, does the job, works great, I'm happy.$LABEL$1

Very disappointing. I bought this game for my 5 year old son. I ended up playing for him. The movement of the heroes is very sporadic. I even had a hard time getting the men to slow down so I could get to the hotspots to click on them. They were very jumpy and he was getting very upset because he couldn't click on anything. The game itself was ok. It only took us about 2 hours to finish it. I probably won't buy any more Rescue Heroes on CD Rom.$LABEL$0

Fell off hard man..... Sorry fellas, but I heard INS on Protect Ya Neck and said he was the dopest in the clan. The guy that comes with lyrics like "I crystalize the rhyme so you can sniff it" was supposed to hit harder than anyone else out there, but for whatever reason this album fell off hard. 17 tracks on the LP and maybe you can peep 3 or 4 fresh beats. The rest of the album sounds like it was put together by some hollywood studio, not the true dungeon sounds that Wu is known for. Had they followed the formula for earlier success, and had RZA realized that his beats with Deck's words is like peanut butter with the jelly, this album would have gone down in history. Instead, it goes down as one of the biggest dissapointments in a long time. It just hurts, man. When you got easily the number one lyricist in the group, he needs to be heard over the coldest beats they got. That shoulda been RZA.$LABEL$0
Great cowbell. This is a great cowbell. It is pretty easy to control how much it rings with proper technique, and it's loud when you hit it hard. It is a little lower tonally than I expected (more of a toonk than a tok, if that means anything), but I can't complain.$LABEL$1

Money.. Moran is a well known CIA agent. To know Moran through her work is diametrically opposite to know her through hervideo interviews on the internet, the most important one already being taken down right now. I might as well writea summary of what that interview said: "you can break your mental and physical limits". This is CIA performancepsychology, and according to rumour, Lindsay Moran is a master of it.Now back to the book review. Lindsay Moran has used every trick of the nonfiction writer: composite characters,fictional characters, outright fabrication, excetera, to create a suspenseful work. The most important point shemakes is that the CIA is no place for women, and that is why she left.This is not the case. Lindsay Moran never left the CIA. No one with this many years of seniority has trouble goingon extended paid leave with benefits (to write a book).In conclusion, the best part of the book is Lindsay potraying herself as a dirty girl when in fact she is a dourGerman Protestant.$LABEL$1
STUPID, SILLY BORING. This book had the possibity to be good. But I got turned off immediately when the ANTI-HUNTING lingo started. Then it just got worse and sillier. I think I will move on to other authors.$LABEL$0
And you thought Nick was bad.... Aaron's jammin' and Nick's pretty good for a prepubescent boy. How about singin' sistah Leslie? Let's just say that the singing gene doesn't run through the females of the Carter family. The title "Like Wow" doesn't plead to be taken seriously. It's just another sugared-up pop song desperate to go mainstream. Her voice sounds much like her brother, Aaron- only whinier. She sings surprisingly worse than Britney Spears and it is obvious that she is just as digitally manipulated as the Pop Princess. "It's True" was better than "Like Wow," but if you're trying to find meaning in those songs, you won't find it. You won't even come close to understanding them; it might be Leslie's low moans or the lyrics themselves. "It's True" was well produced. The music was addicting. It's just too bad that you could hear Leslie.$LABEL$0
Works Flawlessly.....Until. I bought this adapter for my car, it works flawlessly!! However, there is this a warning that says not to leave the adapter in the cassette player while the car is off...I did it just once overnight and it was ruined, luckily, these can be picked up economically. I highly recommend this adapter...and I highly recommend not leaving in the cassette player.$LABEL$1

Nice product. Bought it based on other ratings and haven't been disappointed. Takes some time to find a station that doesn't cause static but once I did, the item works as advertised. Charging the Nano while it plays is also a great bonus.$LABEL$1
Overrated and dumb. Everyone I've talked to said Linkin Park was incredible and awesome. I am a huge fan of rap/metal but this is nothing like Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, and Papa Roach. It was terrible. Their way of blending rap and rock was stupid. Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit combine them so well you almost can't tell when they've converted their singing. BUt Linkin Park starts singing rock then coverts so quickly it's annoying (especcially in the song IN THE END) I hated it and if I could have given it 0 stars I would. If you are in to other rap/metal bands and you're hoping to find the same musical genius in these guys then you're out of luck. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! THIS IS THE ... ALBUM EVER$LABEL$0

Shabby graphics, despicable gameplay. If you enjoy beating up old ladies, if you aspire to be a criminal, if you want to be a jerk or a criminal defense attorney, maybe this game is for you. Sure it's fantasy, but I hated the character, and wanted to play as someone else, namely a cop, so I could give the main character the beat down he deserves. Basically, I wanted to lose. Plus, the graphics are horrible, and stink of the game's PS2 heritage. The guy's legs look like sausages, and the other citizens look like circus freaks. Some textures on buildings are so blurry and low res it looks like an N64 game. The only good thing I have to say is the soundtrack is great.$LABEL$0
Look at other books. I went to Melbourne and Sydney and the book turned out to be pretty skimpy. I flipped through the Fodor's book when I got home and wished I had bought that one instead. I found the Frommer's book to be very light on things to do and good places to eat for the 2 cities I visited. There isn't even a mention of Olympic Park in Sydney and only a handful of restaurants are mentioned. If you are only buying one book I would recommend checking out the Fodor's instead. It contains more thorough information and has good maps throughout for each city.$LABEL$0

Cordless Phone System. We needed to replace a telephone and answering system, due to age of the old system. The Uniden system has proven to be a very suitable replacement. The instructions are very complete and understandable. The ringer is distinctive and quite loud. Sound quality is quite good. The only drawback is the delay between pressing a number key and the tone associated with it. Overall, we are very pleased with the phone system.$LABEL$1
Only 1 good song on the CD. Like many others I bought this CD after hearing "Crawling in the Dark". It is the first song on the CD, and the quality definitely goes downhill quickly after that single song. "Crawling in the Dark" is the only really good song on the CD. There are 2 more decent songs and the rest are just crap. If you really like "Crawling" I recommend that you buy the CD single and hold off on paying full price for this CD unless you get to listen to it entirely somewhere. I know I am disappointed that I paid full price for what amounts to a 1-song CD.$LABEL$0
Humorous children's novel about with science. This book was written in 1962 and shows it age. Otherwise it's a good book. It deals with a boy working on a science project, but things never work out just right. I read it as a child and liked it and just read it again to encourage my 3rd grader to read it. It is funny and explains the scientific method as well as a children's novel can. For 6th graders or older I would recommend the Mad Scientists Club books--much better but for older kids becasue they have more advanced science.$LABEL$1
1 star for one hit wonders. "Jump" is their only good song. The rest of this album is horrible. Little kids rapping really isn't fresh at all. In fact, it's downright annoying. If this is in the bargain bin for $2.00, then pick it up, otherwise, forget about it.$LABEL$0
Appalling.. Excuse me, but wasnt anyone who has read this book as appalled as I was by the fact that the empath-heroine walks herself through the scene of a brutal rape/murder, basically experiencing everything the victim did, and then immediately goes home and has sex with her perfect love interest? Yuck! Until I reached that point, I was genuinely compelled by the book, the choppy writing and the inconsistencies notwithstanding. But that scene was utterly arrogant on Roberts' part. I'm willing to suspend disbelief and lose myself in a romantic fantasy, but it should at least ring A LITTLE BIT true. Am I as a reader supposed to immediately dismiss this perfectly nice girl (who could just as well have been the heroine of another romance) who's been brutally murdered and instead identify with a heroine so callous? Don't insult me.$LABEL$0
As good as the middle volume gets.. The first game introduced us to the cast of the G.U. series and gave us fans of the original games a lot of enjoyable and awesome tweaks to the mundane battle system that was of the first 4 games of the series. I thoroughly enjoyed how this game plays and with the second volume, it adds several new battle mechanics, plus a few mini games for those continuing the series. This game continues the awesome story line that G.U. vol. 1 Rebirth left off on, and basically brings the player closer to solving the mysteries that the game set out for the gamers and Haseo, the main character, to figure out. The difficulty in this game was cranked up a lot from the previous version, so I've been seeing myself get game overs more often and such and it is exactly what I'm looking for. This game is a must get and everyone who loves RPG's should give the .hack series a try.$LABEL$1

Decent product. I have an old '95 s10 pickup with over 200,000 miles that I drive to work. I wanted to make cold morning starting of my pick up more gentle. I use it with a timer and start it a few hours before I leave in the morning. The starting temperature doesn't give me instant heat. The old motor does however appreciate not being starting at 20 degrees. I'd estimate the temperature at start is probably 90 or 100 degrees. I have warm air within a mile of driving. Before installing the heater, I'd just barely be getting warm air by the time I got to work. For the price, it does well enough that I'm satisfied.$LABEL$1
Paid for this item a month ago still have not received it customer service is a joke!. I ordered this back around August 14th and its not September 7th and still have not got it, i wrote a review on this before, i tried getting hold of the company many times with no success and once i left a poor review someone finally called me and assured me with a 75 dollar credit back on my credit card that it be here no later then the 7th. To sum it up its still not im leaving this review to warn that if you order this item or any from this seller and have any issues you will be next to no choice able to get ahold of anyone to solve the problem would rate ZERO stars if had the option.$LABEL$0
Starting Out? Yeahhh Right...... With all do respect to the author, this book is not well written. I got this book to actually learn the Grunfeld. Well It turns out I waisted my money. When I explored the Grunfeld a little more, i found out that it is a worthless opening. I now play the Modern Benoni. The Modern Benoni is excellent for agressive players and if you want to learn the opening I recommend Starting Out: The Modern Benoni. Ive had great success with this opening. Now back to the Grunfeld. The Grunfeld is bad because it lets white get a strong central advantage for no reason at all. Ive also found a few errors in this book. The variations are not well explained so your pretty much on your own the figure them out. So, Please save your money.$LABEL$0
What a trip!. What a great read! Written as a series of short tales, it reminded me of sitting with my buddies swapping stories on any given night. The stories are a great mix of the ribald, the hilarious, and also serious. This is a book that can be read again and again.$LABEL$1

happy with my cajun accordion. I couldn't find a new cajun accordion for this price anywhere. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised.

One of Two Recommended Apologetics books. Craig covers the topic of Apologetics in such a way that is both scholarly, but still accessable to the average person. His book is fairly technical, but not so much that a person can't grasp the overall message of the book.He writes 1 1/2 pages on Alvin Plantinga's view of epistemology. This was extremely helpful in responding to attacks against Christianity. Although, a difficult passage to read, I'd recommend everyone grasp the concepts presented in that section.$LABEL$1
Too little. I recently bought this book and am quite disappointed. If you have never used an art program before, then this book may help.

Cheap plastic threads wear out easily. I bought one, the cheap plastic threads connecting to the faucet wore out. So I bought another. And the cheap plastic threads connecting it to the faucet wore out -- even quicker. I frequently go to get a drink and find that it's spraying water into my face. Brita should be using metal threads which probably would cost them about $0.01 more. After two fast failures, I'm staying away from Brita filters. I don't know what to do with the bunch of extra filters I have.After months using a new Culligan filter, I strongly recommend the Culligan instead: $10 cheaper, AND more durable. Brita, your competition has clearly surpassed you:Culligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet Filter$LABEL$0
This game is a technical disaster. I've got a brand new Nvidia 5200 128 MB graphics card, and just got back into computer gaming, so I was eager to try this game because it's a genre I love. Plus, my PC played COD and Battlefield 1942 so there shouldn't have been technical problems to play it. Boy was I wrong to think that.This game is a technical disaster. I ran it on a P4 with 256 MB RAM and it still crashed on me three times, something that never happened even once with other games at all.After it crashed for the third time BEFORE I even got to start the first mission, I gave up.The developers really dropped the ball on this game. From its looks and screen shots I've seen, it looks like a great game. But if it's too unstable to play, nobody's going to notice it.This game is an absolute disaster from a technical standpoint and the developers should be ashamed of themselves.$LABEL$0
A Positive look at MS. This is a book that gave me hope shortly after being diagnosed. It is a book I bought a number of copies of to loan to family and friends.

A pleasant new series!. This is a fascinating novel about a part of American history that I don't know very well. Shaker society was never really covered in class, and so I read this with fascination. Besides the well done parts about Shaker society, the mystery itself is also fun to read about. Sister Callahan seems to be the only sane person sometimes there as the other Shakers are portrayed as religious fanatics to the point of being violently fanatical. I'm hoping that the people we meet in the next book will be a tad calmer. Besides that one problem I was still enchanted by this book and look forward to the next one.$LABEL$1

Haven't I heard this before?. Crap! Everything about this new effort is crap. Perhaps the chemistry they had on the first album was just a fluke. The musical compositions sound nearly the same as the first album. The beginning riff on "Your time has come" sounds very close to cochise. The lyrics are trite, self absorbed and meandering(kinda like soundgardens last effort). Morello took us down the same ole same ole noise road with his guitar solos. The most annoying quality of this album is the sound, it's flat and lifeless, the mixes are blase, muddy and totally lacking in edge.I don't see anything redeeming about this album. Perhaps they should've stayed in exile awhile longer.$LABEL$0
On a mission. I was disappointed with myself that I didn't notice I had purchased the 12th edition (used 1992)but more importantly that this book was initiated as a catalogue for Christian missionaries. After the entry for GREEK, it states "NT 1638-1989". I thought the NT, New Testament, was originally written in Greek.I will keep it as a handy catalogue of languages, but I will look elsewhere for information on the languages of the world.$LABEL$0

IT IS ALL HAPPENING AS WE ON THE PLANET PLAN IT. I have just recently discovered the KRYON books though they have been with us for the past ten years. ALL IN ITS RIGHT TIME means it was just right for me to read KRYON now. And I feel so blessed and grateful that the books have fallen off a shelf into my hand in the usual synchronistic manner of how I discover books. I want to SHOUT to everyone I know to read these books and see where we have brought ourselves. Unfortunately, most everyone I know is still waiting for the books to fall off the shelves. But for all of you out there and I know there are at least 144000, run don't walk to your nearest book store for BOOK I and I promise you will immediately get the next six or seven and hope that before KRYON is through there are at least a couple more waiting for us! IT'S YOUR CHOICE OF COURSE. p.s. All that KRYON talks about is stuff we are manifesting including this review.$LABEL$1
Awesome travel router!. I am actually writing this review using the DWL-G730AP access point. It's super tiny and works flawlessly.I've used it a a hotel conference where the conference room had 1 lan port and using this router I managed to securely share that connection with over 20 attendees. Performance was more than acceptable and signal strength, despite it's dimunitive size, is impressive.Overall a well balanced product. My only beef is that I wish they had made the power adapter even smaller, and oh yeah, the thing looks ugly. I wish they made it more stylish looking.But those 2 caveats do not affect the performance of the router in any way, they are just my comments.Go ahead and buy it! You'll be satisfied!$LABEL$1
Never received from Amazon. I wouldn't know how this book is. I ordered it December 11 2005 and never received it. Amazon cancelled my order in March because they said they did not receive confirmation from me that there would be a delay. Not only could I show proof I had given the confirmation, I also had an email with an apology saying they would send it to me for free. But because they cancelled my order, we had to start it again. Expected delivery time is the middle of May. 6 months to get a book from Amazon - the book people. What a joke!!$LABEL$0

Pretty Darn Good. I've taught beginners using several "method" books (Mel Bay, Bay and Christianson, Leavitt's Berklee series), and I've currently settled on this one. While I'd prefer not using tablature as a crutch, many students refuse to learn standard notation. Vecchio's book has both, so the motivated student can learn standard notation. Additionally, students respond better to modern material than "Wildwood Flower" or the dreaded "Fourth String Study". The combination of flatpick and fingerstyle is also a nice touch.$LABEL$1
The best and the easiest to read English translation.. Dr. Khalifa's translation of the Arabic Quran certainly appears as a translation inspired by God and as claimed by the translator himself. This translation also inspires the reader and clarifies many things right at the first reading. The translation is also claimed to be most accurate and is most definately an easy read. It comes with many facts regarding the miraculaous mathematical coding of the Quran as contained in one of the appendices to this translation. Highly recommended. If you want to know what Quran is all about, then this is the translation to read. Any other translations thus far are no match to this one.$LABEL$1
a BEAUTIFUL movie!. Oh, wow. This movie is just so magical. Everything about it is absolutely captivating. I love the the time it's set in, because this allows for a lot of beautiful, old-fashioned backgrounds that accent the perfectly poignant acting! The little girl is so adorable, and there are some scenes in this movie that seem to belong in a painting, they are so visually-appealing and colorful. This movie is one of those movies you can watch and totally immerse yourself in and forget you're watching a movie, actually believing you're IN it. I wish I could give it more than five stars, because it truly deserves it. It really gives you that deep-down, warm feeling that only the best movies can make you feel. It's rare to find such a deeply-moving movie that can be enjoyed by anyone!$LABEL$1

Works fine in Israel. I live in Israel. I ordered the unit from Amazon with some fear that it may not work properly here. However the unit is great and it works excellent. You can set up the unit to view your position in Israeli coordinates -new or old. Just look on the internet for the Israel Datum, and enter the data in the Datum screens. The car power-cable is a must, and so is the dispenser. It does not work in house, but I get a good reception in the car (without an antenna). Although this is my first GPS I can tell it is a very good one with many options. When you on the move (for example you drive from one town to another)it draws a line in the map screen, showing your trails. Then when you drive back, it draws parallel lines keeping a clearance between the lanes and showing points of intersections. The unit does not come with any map for Israel. I do not recommend to buy the MapSource as it is not accurate. I give it 4 stars just because I never rate anything as 100%...$LABEL$1
sophmore slump. This CD was awful. Most of the Coal Chamber fans will love this CD, but as far as this CD being better-it isn't.

Incredible video, not to be missed!. I own a copy of this video and sent one this Christmas to my best friend back home. Oddly enough, we both had Rick Larson as a professor in college, and I distinctly remember him as a favorite then as well. He did a phenomenal job making this video, which is well-researched and awe-inspiring to watch. I can't wait until my kids are old enough to watch and fully understand the content that the "Star of Bethlehem" covers; just a few years to go! Since it is a documentary, you must be prepared for the presentation (no Hollywood antics here!), but I assure you, watching this video is time well-spent. I'd highly recommend it as a Christmas gift to anyone and everyone, but don't wait until then to buy one for yourself!$LABEL$1
ONE OF MARGOLIN'S BEST!. I was lucky enough to get an Advanced Readers Copy of this novel, even though I paid a little more money. I just couldn't wait till it was released. Phillip Margolin is one of my favorite courtroom thriller authors. "The Associate" was very interesting. It dealt with Daniel Ames, a lawyer working for a firm in Oregon. He is defending a pharmaceutical company aganist allegations that one of their drugs is the cause to many disfunctions and problems with newborn children. The case picks up steam when a scientist who works for the company gets burned to death. The novel gets more complex from then on, going deeper into the studies of the company and more research. The conclusion is shocking and exciting. This is a must read for courtroom and Margolin fans. Margolin is ten times better than Grisham & Turow!Brad Stonecipher$LABEL$1
Can you see me Now???. I just love this game...It is so different than most video games and the lighting and curtain effects are amazing. I have about a dozen or so Xbox games and this one is by far my favorite. The is just something about the steath nature of the game that just pulls you in. You sometimes think, there is no way out of this situation and them you somehow find a way to get through..You can not run through this game and shot them up. You will find yourself lurking in the shadows and seeing just how quiet and un-noticed you can be, and if that doesn't work, well...a bullet to the head will do the trick...sometimes, the bad guy just has to go down.If you like strategy and thinking, you will love this game, and you will be running through the curtains and shades just for fun...lol..enjoy$LABEL$1

The Indestructible Beat Of Mali. 30 years on, and legends in West Africa, blind couple Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia have their commercial comeuppance in the other-than-world-music sphere, and I am not egotistical or hip enough to admit that you can count me in that group of neo-fans. What I did discover upon the solid recommendation of a sage-in-the-woods is an extraordinary juxtaposition of rhythm and glorious melody and gargantuan beats and a conviction that only 30 years of love could muster. The great Manu Chao produces with a pristine knowledge and his variegated patterns illuminate the vocal while the whole thing effervesces into an explosion of infectious tunes. Believe the hype. My grade: A$LABEL$1
Looks and sounds like the series was made today instead of decades ago.. Very impressive. Long time fan of the series. Have not seen it since it was originally on TV.

In many ways, it is better now that I understand nuances I did not back then.$LABEL$1

Horrible Customer Support. Wow, not only did the whole unit not work, but the customer support is the worst I've ever seen of any group. They actually lied twice during my support ticket and then later went back and said "we couldn't reveal that information earlier", except that is was 180 degree conflicting to what they now said. Then they started threatening legal action if I said anything on user groups. All I wanted was for the unit to be used on Windows Vista, which, like another reviewer here, it should as the packaging says "PC or Mac", not "Windows XP SP1 and Mac OS 9".Unbelievably horrible product and customer support. Run far away from this company.$LABEL$0

Solid instructional book. John Jacobs provides a solid instructional book. Many instructors fall into either an arm driven or (more popular) body driven swing. While body driven instructors put Jacobs in the arm driven swing category, I believe he's really exactly in the middle. He believes that both are required in the appropriate measure.A big bonus is his sections on troubleshooting on the course (including how lie, slope and club will affect shot direction and shape) and the fixs/faults section. The fixs/faults section is an abbreviated version of his Golf Doctor book, but just as good and a little more simplified (for the better). Technical swing mechanists will find fault with some of the physics of his explanations, but his fixes are based on years of experience and have worked for me.$LABEL$1
A compilation of uptempo Disco and R&B tracks that should not be a part of the "Smooth Grooves" series.. Rhino's "Smooth Grooves" series most definitely took a turn for the worse on this volume. Just what this compilation's producers were thinking of when they decided to include the songs by Dynasty, Kraftwerk, Marvin Gaye, Ashford & Simpson, Kano, The People's Choice and the others that managed to make it onto this CD is beyond me as they are all uptempo Disco hits that got plenty of exposure in the clubs but that most certainly don't belong on a romantic music series. If you are looking for a compilation of late-1970s or early-'80s Disco and Urban R&B you'll probably like this compilation but it should never have been included as part of the "Smooth Grooves" line.$LABEL$0
Amazon Customer Service SUCKS!. I ordered 6 bags of this candy in plenty of time for Halloween since my children cannot have anything artificial. When my order came, I only had one bag! There was NO phone number for customer service and when I submitted this problem online I got an automatic message back. This was 2 months ago and NO ONE from Amazon has contacted me. They leave no way for you to report real issues. I was excited to see their organic selection but I will never purchase anything from the lame Amazon grocery store again and I would encourage everyone else not to since there is no way to reach an acutal CS person.$LABEL$0
One of the best r&b albums in my collection!!. This Album is incredible. I have this CD for years and I still play it today, this man put all his feeling and emotion in his songs. I am still asking the same question who is this guy Jesse Campbell and where did he came from? I truly hope he makes another album.his music helped me to a lot of things.If you read this and do not have the album yet GET IT!!!If you like gospel/r&b;/soul GET IT.Thanks Jesse. Greetzz from The Netherlands, Maurice$LABEL$1
Worked great...for about a year.. I really did appreciate this while it lasted. It was in my bedroom and served as a fan/white noise maker/air purifier all in one. I'd only turn it on while sleeping, but it lasted barely over a year before it started making a horrible sound. It sounds like there is a flap or rudder stuck in a fan blade or something. So, I'll be paying shipping to the manufacturer in TN, plus their $10 reshipping fee. Not what I expected from this price point and the frequency in which it was used.$LABEL$0
Buy the 1994 version instead. I bought this version after I saw the 1994 version and was disappointed this one. I found out much later that his version didn't always stick to the script as the 1994 version does. Go with the newer 1994 version instead.$LABEL$0
DO NOT BUY. This should not be sold as a book. It is totally unreadable because the font size is so small. Was it a mistake at the printing factory? They should be ashamed to sell it!$LABEL$0
what the hell is this garbage?. This is utterly awful....riffs so thin and pathetic they make Bush look like Overkill, this album wallows in uncreative swill. The guitarist sounds like he just picked up his instrument a week before, and the fact of the matter is, any band having to hire a guy to guest to play guitar solos (Dimebag Darell) is utterly pathetic. The songwriting is nonexistent, if at best poor...only about 1 song is impressive, Catharsis...the others should be pissed on!!!$LABEL$0
Limo Song. The song missing from the soundtrack that plays twice, once the first time they kiss and again when they are having sex in the limo, is called "This Years Love" by David Grey. It's an awesome song! Most of other songs they put on the soundtrack are just instrumental background music you hardly even notice, rather than the good songs...$LABEL$1

Anne-Victim of Henry's Lust. I was not familiar with this movie (it was released before I was born), but wanted to see it after reading THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL by Philippa Gregory. Gregory portrays Anne as the scheming seducer, but in this movie Anne and her sister Mary are both portrayed as the victims of Henry's lust and the rules of the society in which they live. I am not familiar with Bujold's work, but was impressed with such a young woman meeting Richard Burton on even ground, and even stealing the scene. As for Burton, I found it rather hard to believe him as Henry VIII, especially since the film-makers did not attempt to give him Henry's famous red-gold Tudor hair. It was hard to see him as anything other than "The" Richard Burton. All in all, a good re-telling of the story of Anne and Henry, not just your average costume drama.$LABEL$1
This a great lost album--Poco writting at its best!. This album is one of the best they have ever made--great songs,very emotionally sung and written, about love and loneliness during the Civil War-it also works for the current era-the songs are written beautifully and with romantic feelings-and the singing is perfect-great harmonies-if you are the kind of person that gets emotional with songs-this is the one to get-listen to it with your girlfriend or wife-she is sure to love these songs. Rusty Young, Paul Cotton and Gerorge Gratham are great songwriters and singers. I don't understand why this album is so hard to fine--it should be re-released on CD or released on SACD--Listen to this album-you will not be disappointed if you are a true POCO fan!!!!!$LABEL$1
Good stuff. Finally, a way I can get my heart rate monitor working before I ride away from the house. I grew tired of licking my monitor belt before my bike rides, and this does the trick. As soon as I turn on my monitor, I can see my heart rate. Thanks for a great product.$LABEL$1
A Real Chuckler. This is a great concept. It may have been done before, as some folks have said, but I don't care. What humor *is* original? Everyone borrows from everyone. The point is to make people laugh. And reading about lost Prussian swords and giant shrimp suits just cracks me up. Hahaha! I laugh out loud. It's that funny.$LABEL$1

Disappointing. I felt this movie was terribly disappointing. My issues are:1. She seemed to get freaked out/scared WAY to easily. I was wondering why she would react so terrified to such simple stuff. She knew her dad and uncle were there, so hearing sounds isn't really abnormal.2. They advertised this as in real-time style, but by the end of the movie, you realize that was entirely pointless (SPOILER: there is a twist that makes the real-time aspect completely bogus since what we've been watching isn't what was going on. So what we saw wasn't even the correct unfolding of events).I feel the movie was very cliche with an ending that's been beaten to death. Some may find this scary, but I was just scratching my head wondering why she was so freaked out so quickly. And wondering when I would finally get a good scare. Never happened.$LABEL$0
Unimpressive. I listened to this CD with the hope that it would be better than their previous work. I was wrong. The entire album was rewritten material with the what sounded like a band mailing in the music. If you like Queensrhyche, listen to Empire and Operaton Mindcrime. Those are very well written albums and worth your money. This is not. Steer clear.$LABEL$0
Needs bonus tracks. I became an Elton John fan during the superstar's 1976-82 career lull, A SINGLE MAN (released in '78) among the first of his albums I obtained. The weak lyrics accompany routine music and only three songs stand out: "Big Dipper" and the minor hit singles, "Part-time Love" and "Song For Guy." Both those 45s had great flip-sides, "I Cry At Night" and "Lovesick," respectively, and it is too bad the CD release of A SINGLE MAN did not include them as bonus tracks. The rest of A SINGLE MAN has hints of what made Elton great. It was just a matter of time until he got back in top form with JUMP UP, TOO LOW FOR ZERO and BREAKING HEARTS, to name three of Elton John's worthwhile 1980s albums.$LABEL$0

Same story... different setting. A lot of books are about man's struggle, etc. Frankly, it gets a bit boring and "ho-hum" after awhile. The only difference with this novel is the location: Newfoundland.As a Canadian, I have been to Newfoundland and I think the author's depiction is really off base. I believe it gives readers a false impression of what this maritime province is really like.Some characters are annoying and I'm not a huge fan of her narrative voice. I also dislike the excessive use of sentence fragments. This is, of course, personal preference. My opinion of the book is that the use of descriptive detail and imagery and other literary devices conceals the fact that the plot is fairly bland.$LABEL$0
A Great Feminist Sci-Fi Novel. I came across the name Octavia Butler when searching for science fiction books written by a black woman with a black woman as the protagonist and I found thos gem! If you are into the concept of humanity destroying itself and having to give up part of itself to survive, this book is for you. This book uses metaphors to discuss complex subjects including the role of women, the role of science and genetic enginering, the contradiction that is humanity and learning how to start over when there is little trace of the past. Dawn is an easy read and will definitely cause you to read Adulthood Rites and Imago. A great book!$LABEL$1
Nav300 works okay, but don't buy it. I've been using this GPS for almost two years. It works well enough, but it appears that bankrupt Delphi will not be supplying map updates. I am a road warrior, and I am already running into problems where the maps are not accurate, or roads are missing. Also, it won't save a destination unless you are on a road, so if you are in a parking lot, down a long driveway, etc, you have to go back to the road to save the location. We purchased a Magellan 1410 for my wife to use, and it has better search features. And it's more compact!Conclusion: skip this GPS, and buy one from a solid company like Garmin or Magellan.$LABEL$0
You get what you pay for!. I purchased this radio to listen to FM stations while I am out locally on foot, and while traveling abroad. I tested it in my back yard. It will not tune in the three strongest FM signals from the closest transmitters. They tune in clearly on the wimpy little radio card that plugs into my old Palm Zire PDA. (That PDA has been superseded by a more powerful one with no over-the-air receiver capabilities.) Instead, the Coby attempts to tune in weaker signals from more distant transmitters that are barely audible even at high volume.Unfortunately, it comes in plastic clamshell packaging that has to be cut open. Because it has been opened, it cannot be returned for a refund. Strictly speaking, it is not defective, so it cannot be returned on those grounds, either. Fortunately, it is so inexpensive that I do not feel too terrible about putting it in my stash of items for the next electronics recycling collection day.$LABEL$0
Always Buy First-Party Memory Cards...Here's Why.... Unfortunately, Sony hasn't been able to keep up with memory card demand lately, so us poor saps without one have no choice but to get an alternative, third-party memory card. Borrow a card from a friend instead of buying this one, because this is just awful. If I could give this card a zero rating, I would, since the one I bought was faulty. Get an easier-to-operate Sony card, because with this, you have to load a special disc everytime you play. Resist the temptation if you can't find a Sony card, because this is a waste of your $[money].$LABEL$0

To you who loved Metal in school and thought you'd outgrown. Holy Cow!I'm an avid music collector, over 1000 discs now, and the first time I listened to this I said "oh yes, this is what I have been waiting for..." I graduated high school in the 80s and loved all the heavy metal that was popular back then. Of course as I've grown into my 30s my musical horizons have been expanded beyond belief, into jazz, ambient, alternative, space music, you name it. The other day I got my hands on this and it's just the ticket. All the technical mastery you could want, but in a band that delights in playing AS A BAND and not just shredding into oblivion like Yngwie. Crossed up with some funk and enough other influences to really keep you captivated. It's great stuff!$LABEL$1
A misleading title. If you want a book on philosophy, this is for you. If you are looking for a complete guide to daytrading, you will find this book to be mostly padding.

Mellow Yellow.... I don't care if the yellow 'glow' is supposed to be arty farty...it gives you a headache. Florida has it's own beautiful light, take the yellow filter off, it makes everyone look jaundiced.Script...?? There isn't one, just some filler, in-between some average stripping. Channing's bum wobbles like jello, Matt Bomer looks great, but even that doesn't redeem this movie for me. Plus is it just me or is there something not right about Matthew McConaughey ?Anyway, if you want to see Male Strippers go to Chippendale's or a gay strip joint...maybe even rent 'The Full Monty', any of those options would be a lot more fun than this !$LABEL$0
one sided flag making it attractive from one direction and faded out looking from the other.. I was really lookin forward to replacing the orange caution flag on my power chair with my new American Flag with the gold trim. Unfortunately. I guess I must not have read the sellers description of the flag after my having seen a few others very similar if not the same as this one save for they were described as having the same appearance on both sides unlike my new one thats bright an cheer e on one side and has the appearance of having faded out on the other. My bad, I guess. Oh well. Win some. Lose some.$LABEL$0
Simply the Best ONE. I have known this version of Messiah since my early childhood in the 'sixty's. You need to remeberthis is Scripture set to music. In making this both Handel and those you hear on the recording have affirmed my belief in both beautiful music and Our Lord Jesus Christ. You experience both the spiritual and sublime here.Mr Ormandy with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir have brought the highest Praise and Glory ever known on Earth to God in this presentation. I am not am expert in the music of this, I am a consumer who is now 51 and blessed by it every time I hear it.$LABEL$1
I have a new favorite author after reading this book!. I first encountered this story in the pages of Cosmo--it hooked me and I went out immediately to buy and finish it. Anne Rivers Siddons writes the kind of books that you don't want to end. She creates another world--really paints a unique vision with her words. This story rings so true, it really has that feel of authenticity--almost autobiographical even. I have read most of her other books as well, but this one which I read a few years ago remains my favorite...As an aspiring writer, her writing both inspires and intimidates me it is so good!$LABEL$1
Cheap - breaks very easily. It cooled okay when it worked but the wires were seperating from the plug and it only worked for a few days. I sent it back and Amazon who replaced it and this one only worked for two weeks. I gave my Rocketfish cooling fan when I got this one. While I went through two of these quickly, my old Rocketfish is still working like new. I would not recommend this product. It's not worth the time or expense of returning it again.$LABEL$0
Simply the best BTAS!!. I've read through many reviews where people state that the early Batman: The Animated Series episodes were the best, and that may be true where story is concerned, but if you're an animation and story fan (not just great story or great animation, one always seemingly sacrificed), this later set of episodes were the best. Personally I always felt the animation in the early BTAS episodes were weak and "iffy" at best, even if the stories themselves glued you to your seat. However, with these later episodes nothing is sacrificed, as both the story and animation function in great synergistic fashion!I feel that vol.4 will be the best seller of the 4 available. I'm currently being proven correct in that assumption it seems, as I have found this vol.4 at only a smattering of stores, as most are sold out. In other words, get this vol.4 set now and enjoy some of the best episodes this wonderful show had to offer!$LABEL$1

SO I TRIED THE REST OF THE DVD PLAYERS IN MY HOUSE KEPT SAYING DISC READ ERROR I HAVE 3 DIFFERENT DVD PLAYERS THAT IT SAID DISC READ ERROR. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO BE SOLD TO ANYONE.

Just What I Wanted!. A beautiful collection with instrumental, melodious choral, and sweet solos on traditional hymns. Most verses are included in the vocals, but not every verse in every song. organ and orchestra; not overbearing; a great accompaniment to daily activities or devotional times. I'll probably also buy Volume 1 or the collection of "Passionate Worship."$LABEL$1
Errors, errors, and more errors!. This book at one time was good I am told, but the 8th edition (2002) is now outdated with many errors. The CD on heart sounds which is included is insulting to medical students. The book has terrible photographs which make the patients look jaundiced or cyanotic. I am sorry I bought it. There is no question that Swartz's book on physical diagnosis is the best. Swartz has a great free CD on the complete physical exam which is included with the book.$LABEL$0
A MUST HAVE!!!. This is my first Blu-Ray purchase and I couldn't be more pleased. This is one of my favorite films, even though I only had it on Laser Disc before this. Will watch this many more times!$LABEL$1
Not very good! Judge a book by it's cover!. When I first picked up the CD, I felt the artwork looked slapped together in haste and thoughtlessness...I should have know that what was on the inside, was equally thoughtless!I personally think "Farewell" is their true masterpiece!I'm super surprised at the steep drop creativity between these two records."Breaking point" is full of the same tired electronic sounds and music patterns that we've heard for the past 15 years now.While the lyrics are even more obvious, and at times embarrassing!!!On a nit picky note, the production sounds crummy too. My bet is almost all instruments were soft (computer based) synths.D-sides at best!!TRY HARDER!!!!!!$LABEL$0
Absolutely the Best Bread Machine recipe book. This book is GREAT! I actually have the 2002 Hermes House version but have bought this version as gifts. I have another book plus manufacturer's books (I'm on my second breadmaker) and this book tops them every time. The proportions are different than the other books and work great! I've made breads (sun dried tomato is my favorite although I add basil, oregano, and garlic powder), rolls, pizza dough (the best ever), the small pizza's (sfincione), the focaccia, pitas - all are great and my kids request them over and over.$LABEL$1

Awful, awful, awful...... What were the producers thinking? They abandoned all of the things that made the first Blair Witch a true classic. This abysmal piece of horse defecation features the misadventures of a group of adolescent losers, who stumble through the film cursing, fighting and giving off horrible attitudes. There is no suspense, no fright, and no reason to watch this one. If Mystery Science Theater 3000 were still on, this would surely have been spoofed by now.$LABEL$0

Excellent value and very durable. My daughter is around 10 months old and this toy has really become one of her favorites. It is easily assembled, solidly constructed and very tough. A single catch converts it from a ride on to a step behind walker, and the spinning rattles and other accesories are fun as well as not easily removed. If you want a great aid to help unassisted walking this is it, and at a fraction of the cost of some other more complicated versions. I highly recommend (and so does my daughter!).$LABEL$1
Stack-On's are Great... Wonderful product (Not Premium Security but does the Job) etc.. I like this product because it conveniently provides storage for all necessary valuables and hardly requires a manuals to guide to set.Though not an exceptional product to protect essential valuables it does the job and significantly easy to disguise and hid. under a surface or behind elusive spots. Over-all, I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple way to storage minor valuables or possessions from family. That is, if you are trying to keep a secret. I find it still has some flaws and is susceptible to lock picking with the correct tools.$LABEL$1
Marvelous Throughout. It's a rare album that is such a pleasure to listen to from start to finish like this one. Anyone who likes americana music in the vein of Lucinda Williams, Roseanne Cash, Allison Krause, Shelby Lynne, or Shawn Colvin should seek this album and performer out - yet she is not exactly like any one of these more well known artists. Less gritty than Lucinda, but the album does feature some tastefully dirty electric guitar. Not as folk-pop as Colvin. Sally's songs convey their Appalachian roots, but she isn't as bluegrass as Allison Krause. More Asheville than Nashville. In short, she's a singular creative voice playing with consistent quality and authenticity. Check her out!$LABEL$1
Extreme waste of money. I'm a mom of 11 month old twin girls. My mother bought these for us to save space in our kitchen. I wish I would have read the reviews before she bought it. The reviews are 100% true. It is the most disgusting food trap I have ever owned. You cannot get the food out and they are too heavy to shake out all the time. The toys on the side are a waste too. They are not in a location that the girls even notice them and are too hard to push to get them to work. I have tossed them out. What a WASTE!$LABEL$0

Pathetic - Don't bother - Horrible - Horrible - Horrible.. This movie was a complete waste of time, totally disjointed and unorganized. the writing was lame, I don't think there was a script at all... Shrek 1 & 2 were fantasic funny movies... I rented this movie expecting a similar enjoyable experience.. 25 minutes into this DVD I had not cracked a smile, there were no jokes and the story just made no sense at all.Don't waste your time or money on this one... go get Shrek 1 or 2 over this disaster$LABEL$0
syrian whirling dervishes. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT ALBUM STARTING OFF WITH A BEAUTIFUL CALL TO PRAYER.THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO THE MUSIC OF THE WHIRLING DERVISHES OF TURKEY WILL FIND THIS VERY DIFFERENT,THE MUSIC IS IN THE STYLE OF ARAB MAQAM RATHER THAN TURKISH,THE ARAB NEY FLUTE HAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SOUND TO THAT OF TURKEY & ON THIS ALBUM KETTLE DRUMS ARE REPLACED BY HAND HELD TAMBOURINES.THE VOCALS ARE SUBLIME ESPECIALLY DURING THE DHIKR & ALTOGETHER THE OVERALL SOUND IS VERY RICH & EXOTIC.IT IS NICE TO HEAR THE QANUN(ZITHER) EMPHASIZED,ESPECIALLY THE SOLO INSTRUMENTALS.SHEIKH HAMZA SHAKKUR HAS A BEAUTIFUL MOVING VOICE.THIS CD SHOULD INTEREST ANYONE WHO IS SERIOUS ABOUT SUFI MUSIC.$LABEL$1
Excellent for young children. We have a three year old son we wanted a train table for, but were concerned that our 16 month old twins would continuously destroy the track. This table was the perfect solution. Our son can enjoy it without his sisters destroying it.

This is a filler and does not remove swirl marks.. I had my car for less than a year and my mother backed into it with her car when backing out of her garage. I got it fixed and the body shop left swirl marks in the clearcoat. I've already taken it back twice and they even repainted it because of a paint mismatch and they still left swirl marks. It's getting exhausting dealing with them so I thought I would try this. I used as directed and even followed with the wax that was recommended in the directions and it seemed to work and I was so pleased. Then the next time I washed it the swirl marks were visible once again. I'm so irratated about it I'm considering trading it in already.$LABEL$0
Hate Crime. This work is not a serious study of the relationship between Catholicism and Judaism.The Church is held up to ridicule by the simple method of suppressing the Church's statements of condemnation of anti-Semitism and then quoting apparently anti-Semitic statements out of context. A professional historian can only wince at the vicious caricature of Pius XII, a man who heroically saved thousands of Jewish lives but who in this book emerges as a combination of Elmer Fudd and Adolf Eichman.This book is about the rage of an excommunicated priest who, despite his cloying claims to love the Church, has decided to don a white hood and burn his own anti-Catholic crosses.$LABEL$0
Kids. Good movie bought it for my kids they seemed to like it. Got their attention and honestly not a bad movie.$LABEL$1
Poorly researched... seek information elsewhere.. I am always interested in theories regarding who exactly ordered the massacre (as my Grandfather John D. Lee was the only man ever held accountable.) I am not completely convinced that the order did not come from Brigham Young or someone very close to him in the foodchain. But this book is so poorly researched and written that it was hardly worth my time and certainly not worth my money. She gets even the most basic biographical information wrong - information that is readily availible in scores of other books and websites. I honestly don't know why she even bothered...$LABEL$0
Definantly Different. This book started out ok but into the fifth chapter it got a little bit ridiculous, that's when I stopped reading it. I have read a numerous amount of her books and this one is the worst yet. It was so predictable.

Do not buy this product. This piece of software doesn't function properly at all.It doesn't work with Apple Logic, contrary to what is advertised.It was written by an amateur programmer, and crashes very often - about 1 out of 2 kits that you open will quit unexpectedly.For a software drum machine to contain mostly live and acoustic drum samples doesn't make much sense since software is mostly used for electronic music. No trance, or electronic samples at all.All that for over 50 dollars makes idrum way overpriced.Also the graphics were stolen from Garageband.A program like that should be freeware, or at the very most shareware.$LABEL$0
I feel the fragrance of the Brut cologne .... I feel the fragrance of the Brut cologne was very nice. It wasn't too strong. It had just enough to put off a nice smell.

visually amazing, lacking everywhere else. i too waited a couple of years to see this film arrive in the USA, and wanted to love this film so very much. i've always loved Dave and Niel's work in the past, and i expected this to be no less wonderful. sadly, i left feeling empty. while the efforts and the visuals were worth a rental, the storyline took Mirrormask to the edge of what could have been a hugely successful masterpiece and dumbed it down. it is too scary and dark for young kids, too wierd for tweens, too childish for adults. with more defined dialog and a coherant plot, the film could have been a classic for all ages. this just seems like a spoiled rotten little kid dressed up for the fancy ball with no one to take them there. i for one, am greatly disapointed.$LABEL$0
NOT a tradiional fairy tale.... The Conjurer Princess is a modern sort of fairy tale-- dark, quirky and bittersweet. All the usual cliches are avoided successfully. Lylene is not a sweet and beautiful princess; closer to a determined and basically honorable person on a quest that is not what she thinks it is. Those who appear to be enemies are not what they seem...nor those who seem to be allies.The ending, like those in all of Vivian Vande Velde's books, is not quite a happily-ever-after conclusion. Left wide open to speculation about the future...If you're looking for a realistic and biting fantasy in which nothing is ever quite as it appears, give this one a try.$LABEL$1

Amazon get your act together ! ! ! !. Here is a discription of what I boughgt :Danner 02720 Pond Mag 9.5 950-Gallon-Per-Hour Pump with Foam PrefilterInstead of giving me a FOAM PREFILTER they gave me a cheap plastic cage in the shape of a cone to protect ther filter. Any small debris could pass throught the openings in this cheap plastic cage. I called Amazon and told them how I was cheated they did make it right and are overnighting me the proper foam filter that was advertized with the pump. On one hand I was so mad on the other hand I was happy that Amazon made it right with me. It almost seems that Amazon is slipping a bit in customer satisfaction from 2 years ago. Even the picture of the pump on the product page is misleading. The picture shows a smaller model than what you actually recieve. I am seriously concidering not shopping with amazon because of their mistakes. PS: the factory box was damaged but the packing box was in good shape, no contents were damaged.Aaron$LABEL$0
Have they ever read Jane Austen. This movie was a complete disappointment. it left me wondering one thing, have the creator's of this film ever read or watched Persuasion. What was the point of hitting the shuffle button on one of the most beautiful plots ever written. They completely took any meaning away from Wentworth's letter and mixed up the plot so much the to create drama they had Anne Elliot running all through bath. The ending seemed forced.$LABEL$0

Review - Muldoon by Pamela Duncan Edwards. Totally alsome!!! I HIGHLY recomend(an I don't hardly ever recomend anything,much less HIGHLY) this book for the youngsters. It's Hilarious!!! Easy for children to read and they will love the illustrations. I know my wee ones enjoyed this story. Muldoon had us laughing throughout the entire story,had us wondering what to expect next. That's one silly pooch. Loved It!!!!!Muldoon is a very busy little pooch,I don't see how he does it. Ever since the West family chose him over other applicants, Muldoon has provided quite well of his duties. It's a tough job taking care of the whole entire household on your own. All the work he does I think the West's should give Muldoon a raise.$LABEL$1

Works, but poor quality.. These dog tag silencers do perform their function, but they are very cheap looking and poor quality. They fit incredibly tightly and it seems like they will probably rip soon. My dog tags aren't oversized or anything like that. If you want something that does silence the dog tags, these will work, but I can't say how long they'll work for.$LABEL$0

Just to even it out.. Mead paper is pretty but generally good enough. I haven't actually bought this paper from amazon but after reading the other review of the guy not getting 16 pounds of paper, I though I would give five stars to even things out.

A "popcorn movie" from Mexico!. Los Cuatro Juanes(1966) is an action packed adventure film starring Luis Aguilar, Antonio Aguilar, Javier Solis, and Narciso Busquets as "The Four Juanes". All four outlaws are being chased by government troops. When bandits kill the father of a lovely, innocent woman(Alma Delia Fuentes), the Cuatro Juanes "adopt" her into their gang. Keep in mind this DVD was mastered off a 2nd or 3rd generation VHS tape and the video and audio quality is not first class. At least this Laguna DVD was cheap.By Mexican standards of the 1960's, this was an all-star movie. There's a scene where Los Cuatro Juanes blow up a bridge with TNT so troops cannot chase them. This may have been referenced in Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch(1969). Los Cuatro Juanes is pure entertainment.$LABEL$1

good, but dull tip.. W\It seems well made, and comes with spare gaskets. However, the tip is rounded, not sharp, and you'll have to use a skewer or something else sharp to make your holes in tougher cuts.

Fantastic Read. I received this book for Christmas and I haven't stopped laughing since. It is one of the most hilarious books I've ever read and apart from being funny, you actually have to be quite intelligent and knowledgeable about history and current events to truely enjoy this book. Every line is loaded with a bit of history mixed with irony and humor that is truely smart, innovative and hilarious.Anyone who loves humor, history or just smart writing will love this book!$LABEL$1
OK, but.... A fine - refined - version. I don't think CvD quite gets into this music like many others, though. The playing is faultless and the recording wide-ranging BUT it is not as clear and detailed as it could have been. It was like listening to music through a fog, with the high frequencies typically veiled in the usual Telarc manner. Musically, I'm not too fond of the way he does the famous first movement melody. The 5/4 and March-like Scherzo movements come of the best here. The Scherzo's tempo is grand and bold rather than lightening fast like many others, which is OK. One can wallow in the bass drum parts. The finale is missing the necessary neuroses.The filler, the Polonaise from Eugene Onegin, is a peculiar, if not inappropriate, choice. One of Tchaikovsky's heavier overtures would have been better suit - or nothing at all.$LABEL$1
Kindle format a shame. This review is not aimed at the content of the book; rather at the utter lack of care for formatting the Kindle edition.Not only do I find hyphenated words in the middle of the page, chapters are not page dependent and may occur anywhere on the page, and now line spacing has gone to heck in a handbasket as well.That's what prompted me to write the review. I literally have a g and a d that are overlapping!That said, it's readable; but I tell you when the formatting is so bad that it effects the flow of the writing - it need re-done.Hopefully an anomaly.$LABEL$0

It wasn't good enough.. This is the worst book I've ever read! I mean Damon's all nice and stuff but sometimes the author makes a boring plot. And I thought that the book made it boring because all it talked about Damon about Mrs. Serson, Jessica thinking Damon has a crush on her, Lacey flirting in almost every part of her part of the story. Also, what does Lacey have to do with the Damon-Jessica-Mrs.Serson thing?$LABEL$0
Stinks. I bought this product for the conveninece of not having to open my desktop and for the mobility- being able to transfer it from desktop to laptop. Worked great for about 2 months and then it started causing my computer to reboot byself. At first this happened with my desktop- i was convinced my computer was broken- i spent $100 on repairs (I know I got ripped off here). Until I started using it with 2 laptops and the same thing started happening. I took it to another techy who told me that this is a frequent problemt with these usb deviced and that I would have to do something to my "bio" - i said screw it- and bought a built in card. I know other people who have the same problem and it could be very costly- when you are in the middle of working on a file and it reboots. Neygear CS sucks too- they outsources and I ended up speking to some girl in India who did not understand my question and just kept reading the same script over and over again- DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!$LABEL$0
Glad I did not read this one first!. I actually listened it to, and did not like the reader at all - she did not do the accents very well, and when the character "bellowed" she croaked... anyway, if I had the hard copy I likely would not have finished it. Both characters got on my nerves, especially Gen. I have read most of the other McLeod and De Piaget novels, and found them to be most enjoyable. My favorites are "A Garden in the Rain" and "With Every Breath". All in all I do not think this is a good introduction to Lynn Kurland. Read other titles first - they are far more enjoyable, and chances are you will even reread them!$LABEL$0

good after a little work done to it.. I gave this product 4 stars because When we got this the black part was painted farther up onto the chrome than the picture shows. When we put it on my car the black stuck out like a sore thumb. Luckily my husband paints cars so he was able to take some lacquer thinner and some tools to remove the black paint. After that it looked awesome! So far its a good product, it fits well and looks great on my car. Plus it was super fast shipping!!!$LABEL$1

Messy, Messy, Messy!. Well, it grinds ok, I agree with other posters about the fine grounds, but I'm not the coffee fan in the family here, so ignore my opinion on that. However, I am the one that makes the coffee each day, and oh my is this thing MESSY! The static provides a mini-coffee explosion upon opening the canister, the grounds get stuck in the duct that leads to the canister and they have to be dug out with a knife/spoon something to that effect. I really wouldn't recommend it just on the basis that it is SO incredibly messy.$LABEL$0

basic pedometer. This is a fairly cheap pedometer that is made out of kinda cheap looking plastic. But so far I have had no problems with it. It has steps, miles, km, and calories (which are estimated I'm sure). You can clear settings with the "clear" button. I appreciate it's battery-saving method of shutting off after not being touched for awhile, but that's easy to get the screen back on again.$LABEL$1
Started Out Funny but Got Pretty Dull. I thought that the premise of this movie sounded interesting so I gave it a try. I was watching it with a friend and we both were enjoying it at the beginning.

fantastic book. I love Sarah Dessen's books but this is my favorite so far. I was able to relate with the main character Macy so much and it was so true to life. Many of the things that Macy has to go through in this book were happening to me at the same time as I was reading the book. I loved being able to connect with the book and being able to get so much meaning from this book. This book has so many great meanings and deals with great topics and I highly recommend this book to everyone. I just couldn't put it down it was so good.I also recommend That Summer and Someone Like You. They too are wonderful works by Sarah Dessen and one can receive alot from them.$LABEL$1

Sour Grapes for Sony. Toshiba was a major player is the development of DVD. Sony wanted it all and lost out, having to work it out with Toshiba and join their DVD parade.Now, years later, Sony wants it all again. They want control over the next generation high def DVD format, so we now have a format war.Toshiba's first HD-DVD player is great! It's up-conversion of standard DVD is the best I've seen and the actual HD-DVD image is fantastic. The best HD picture quality I've ever seen.I'm sure Blu-Ray will be great as well. It's just too bad that this format war is on. But I'll tell'ya, at half the price of the cheapest Blu-Ray player, buying HD-DVD is a no brainer.Would you want to spend $1000.00 on the Sony or Samsung Blu-ray player and get no movies, or the Toshiba HD-DVD player and get 25 HD-DVD movies for the same price?Blu-ray might have Sony's Columbia Pictures locked up but HD-DVD has Universal Picture's and Dreamworks saying they are going HD-DVD only.Yes, it's a war.$LABEL$1

Troy-Bilt TB25BP Gas Blower. The blower worked one time. We replaced the spark plug, had new gas/oil and gas can. Called the company and was told it might be the coil? The next nightmare was finding a place to have it fixed since only one of the five places they suggested would in fact take it. It remains in the repair shop and of course if it is 'carburator' related it will not be covered under warranty, per the repair shop. I will never buy another Troy Bilt product or anything mechanical on line again. Probably will never blow leaves by the looks of the repair time!$LABEL$0

Not surprising.... It's not a big surprise to find this effort by Chris Cacavas so satisfying. Having listened to much of Cacavas' music over a period of several years, this first-rate collection of songs is an expected pleasure. Strong, complex, inventive, clever lyrics performed in a style that is often deceptively mild and gentle - they'll put you off your guard - then hammer you with their real intent.$LABEL$1
Wonderful series!. I love the series and I am hoping that it is complete because I would really hate to miss any of the shows.$LABEL$1
Terrible.. I stuck with this book for 120 pages. By then our heroine had lost her brothers (gettysburg), her father (mauraders), her mother and her fiance (buried alive), been gang raped, and was hit several times by men, even her 'love interest'. This book smacks not only of violence (which civil war or any war books have to some degree) but particular violence against women. And the writer doesn't understand the womans view. After being gang raped , she falls into bed without qualms with someone else a few days later. It is so disturbing that I found myself searching for info on the author. 'Felicia Andrews' may be a man since the copywright info is in the name of charles grant. That made me feel better because at least a woman did not write so callously about another woman. Scratched this writer, whether it is a man or woman, off my buy list.$LABEL$0
Deceiving Photo. The picture is deceiving. The face looks blue in the picture, but it is really purple. I found the watch to feel cheaply made. The bracelet felt substandard to what I am used to with Invicta. I currently own two Invicta watches. I sent this watch back for three reasons. I didn't like the color of the face. I found the watch to be smaller than I prefer. The bracelet seemed cheaply made, and the black etching on the links was not evenly applied.$LABEL$0
Can't reccomend it. I bought this CD eagerly anticipating some great new music. I should have read the reviews with a more cynical eye. Perhaps some are legitimate fans, but I have my doubts. I found this CD to be droll and tedious to listen too and I can't imagine anyone finding something to rave about. Not that every song is a complete loss, but as a whole the CD is not worth owning.$LABEL$0
Excellent portrayal of a young woman who becomes a queen. This motion picture is first-rate at every level. It gives one a glimpse of what Elizabeth's early live must have been like with a half-sister who wants to behead her through a lover who betrays her. This movie lost by a photo finish to Shakespeare in Love for the Academy Award as Best Picture of the Year. It will not disappoint history buffs and works as a drama that makes history live. This film is one of the best portrayals of Elizabeth put on film. I recommend it without qualification.$LABEL$1
SHORT STORIES FROM MARGARET MARON. I AM NOT A FAN OF SHORT STORIES, BUT THIS VOLUME FROM MARGARET MARON IS OUTSTANDING.

Caveat Emptor. If you're considering this CD for "Spellbound" be aware that the theremin part is played by one of the woodwinds (sounds like an oboe to me).

The performance of the Rozsa Concerto is adequate but not by any means outstanding.$LABEL$0

a healthy cooking MUST have!. The Scanpan is just amazing. There, I said it.I typically go through a new (10-12") non-stick frying pan in less than a year. I bought this one to test it out...I heard the Scanpan line was awesome and needed a smaller pan to cook my own personal diet foods (while the rest of my family hogged down on spaghetti bolognese and pasta dishes).It is perfect to cook a few eggs, a piece of fish, your own personal little stir fry, and whathaveyou. And here's the kicker: you don't need hardly ANY oil. I use an olive oil spray and that's good enough! And here's the OTHER kicker: the clean up ROCKS. You don't HAVE to clean up because 99.99% of your cooked food will wind up on your PLATE instead of stuck around the sides of the pan. Imagine that?!!Once my 10" and 12" pans die (I might accidentally drive over them) I'm going to invest in the next sizes up in the Scanpan Professional.$LABEL$1
This book was a bit too redundant.. I think Jean Auel is an awesome writer. However, I think this book focused way too much on "how amazing" Ayla was in the eyes of all the other characters. I adored Ayla in "Clan of the Cave Bear," and "Valley of Horses." (I have read those two books over and over again.) In this book, Ayla seems too subdued, or not really shining through, as in her previous books. I agreed with one reviewer which stated that Ayla spent too much time explaining and retelling what all of Auel's readers had already read in her previous books. I probably will never re-read this book. I still love Jean Auel and Ayla!$LABEL$0

DMB or Aerosmith?. One collosal blunder! When the decision to change producers was made, the DMB as we knew it.... ended. Sad but true. The melodic, witty sounds of previous DMB songs does not exist on this CD. The music "blends" into itself. The creative, jam session-like tunes that made Dave and the gang stand out among the mainsteam is forgotten. The drummer keeps time, thats it. The violinist is wayyyyy back there somewhere, Dave is having his favorite accoustic guitar tuned or waxed or something saving room in the studio for electric. Oh wait... was that a sax!! naaaaaaah... I think the "new" producer burped! Oh, but I did hear Aerosmith did a few cameos... NOPE.. that's DMB sounding just like Brittany and Aerosmith. Go ahead listen.. hear em? What a shame... Shame on you DMB for not recognizing your gift and hanging on as long as you could.... who said change is good anyway? I hope DMB reads these reviews and takes care of business!$LABEL$0
Look at the second and fourth review. The second review and the fourth review were obviously written by the same person. They both are written by "a music fan" one saying from moscow, the other from michigan. They also both use the word rhythm in the praising the music. On the form to write a review, they ask where you are from, giving moscow as an example. That is the clear reason why he said he was from moscow. He must have been offended that someone wrote a bad review after his good one, so he decided to write another good one. Don't trust it!$LABEL$0
Good Information about the Truth. I read this book in high school before I joined the Army. I did not understand a lot of his points or rather did not want to understand his accusations about Jews because I come from a strong Christian family. I spent 4 years in the service and because of that I had plenty of down time to research about everything going on with America and why we are in this war still! So now I find this book on Amazon 5 years later and have always reflected certain information toward this book. I find it very informative and balanced.In my final opinion I think every one should read this and take most if not all of this book into consideration.$LABEL$1
Going back to my 35mm camera. I bought my DX4900 less than a year ago. I was happy with it when I first bought it but the last several months I've noticed about half the pictures I take come out blurry and very, VERY grainy. I am not doing anything different from when I first bought it, so I suspect the quality just does not last or stand the test of time. Also, from the beginning, the rechargeable battery life has been pathetic. I can take about 17 pictures and then it shuts down because of low battery power~ however, if I set it in the dock it reads that the battery power level is good! I spent $400 on this camera (incl. the dock, as a package deal) and I expected it to last longer than a year. I can't count on my pictures coming out and have lost too many precious moments by using this piece of crap.$LABEL$0
Disappointing. I really enjoyed the first book in the series, in large part because of its sense of moral ambiguity. There were no "good guys" and "bad guys", just people, most of them flawed, trying to live their lives.Then I started reading the rest of the series, and it's a hackneyed series of battles between Good and Evil, interspersed with gratuitous sex scenes. What happened?One thing that happened is that Amazon saw my five-star rating on that first book and keeps trying to get me to buy the rest of the series. Hopefully entering some lower ratings will dissuade it.$LABEL$0
Rachels' best essays; about Professor Rachels. This is a great collection of some of Rachels' best essays. They are clearly written and show someone engaged in moral philosophy at its best.

Ok, but nothing like what I expected.. Overall, I'm totally disapointed.I'd like to kick myself for not checking the reviews on here before buying this product at the store for FULL price.The "handle" is useless, so I just push the food through the slicer with my hands, which sooner or later will probably end in a hospital visit.I have sliced some basic veggies without too much trouble, but not like I expect an $80 slicer to. I haven't even bothered to do anything but straight slicing b/c its obvious to me it's just going to irritate me.The "dial" that adjusts slicing size doesn't stay - I start slicing something thin, and wind up with half inch cuts by the time I'm done.I wouldn't buy this product again, and I wouldn't recommend it for the price.$LABEL$0
Fun for the kids. I ordered this jumper online. When I received it there was no jumper inside the box only the motor. I emailed Amazon's customer service and explained what happened. They arranged for UPS to come back and pickup it up the next day. They also refunded me the shipping charges. So thought was great. I went to Toys R Us and bought the jumper. This is a great toy even though my son did not seem to interested in it. He is two years old. But his cousins who are four and five years old had a blast.I'm sure he will have to get adjusted to it. The jumper is pretty big and it really sets up quickly with no hassle. Also when you buy the toy at the store you can purchase a 1 year warranty for $24.00.$LABEL$1
do horses really use this. I was very disappointed. Do people really use this on their horses. I put it on clean nails and within a day, it was peeling off like celophane!

Good Price Bad Glasses. While the price is definitively right, and it's hard to complain when they come this cheap. I'm actually concerned that these glasses may injure my eyes. They are very dark and seem to offer no UV protection at all. When I drive on a sunny day, the light blinds me as if I'm not wearing anything at all.So yeah, if you want something cheap then go for it. But if you want glasses that actually protect your eyes from the sun I'd look elsewhere.$LABEL$0
garbage. this book was some of the most heavy handed, trite garbage I have ever read. I love coming of age books, books about friendship, about interesting and wonderous cultures.

A good book that shows how stupid McCarthyism actually was.. The Crucible is an interesting book about the Salem Witch Trials. It is very obvious from the readers point of view, what is happening and how everything could be stopped.Unfortunately, because the characters only want to save themselves, the truth becomes lies and lies become truth. Everyone has a choice of saving themselves and condemning others or standing up for the truth, condemning themselves, and stopping the cycle. Strangely, the "perfect" people of the town all lie. Arthur Miller wrote the play during The McCarthy Trials. In his book it is quite obvious how stupid the whole thing really is and the book has almost a direct parallel to the Mc Carthy trials, yet no one thought their was any problem with the trials. The book was a very interesting way to show the people what was really happening.$LABEL$1
Rope too big. I originally had the small size because my dogs are 25 lbs. each, but their mouths could not go around and pick up the plastic jug from the bottom (which they are supposed to do so they can shake the kibble out). I returned the small one, and order the extra small, and even though the opening for kibble was smaller, the rope was not. Even when I broke up the kibble it can not get around the rope. I was going to return it, but was in the middle of a move, so now I'm stuck with it, and it never gets used. I suppose if I can somehow untie the rope, unbraid it, remove a section, rebraid it, and retie it, it may work...but as you can see that sounds like an awful lot of work, for something that should have been designed better from the start.$LABEL$0
Look great, poor quality, rust spots. Moved into a new home and wanted new quality flatware. Bought 2 sets at Bed, Bath & Beyond. I have washed them carefully in a brand new dishwasher, with non-lemon powder. Over a couple of months noticed most of the forks had rust spots between the tines. I have tried to remove the rust with no success. I am going to try to return these sets to B,B&B. My last style of Oneida I had for over 15 years, perfect, just wanted a new sleek style. Very disappointed!$LABEL$0
Kind of sketchy. Just received my Medela membranes in the mail. Was a little nervous bc of the mixed reviews. The membranes I received did come in Medela packaging. However, the package is opened at the corner, so it looks like the product was tampered with OR non-Medela product was placed into Medela packaging. Sold by Linen Manor LLC. Comparing the product to my previously store-purchased Medela membranes, they look identical but not sure if that means anything. Still debating whether to send it back.$LABEL$0
Piece of junk. This camera was inexpencive and I noticed when I bought it that it was just a fixed-focus, no flash, CMOS censor that only supports CIF resolution so I was not expecting to get good pictures out of it. Having that said, the picture quality of this thing is still a big disapointment. On the other hand I had no problem at all loading the software / driver in Windows XP like others have said. This camera was cheap, but I still feel like I got ripped off because something that takes pictures this horrible should cost under $10. I used to own another small CMOS censor no-flash fixed focus camera and the pictures it took were 10x better.$LABEL$0

Dead On Arrival. To be fair, I don't know how the unit works because the one I received from AllStarsOnline did not work at all. It was being sold "as is". It never powered up out of the box. I guess I should have known by the inexpensive price and the unwillingness of the seller to test the unit.Nevertheless, the seller did send all cables, accessories and manuals for the unit. They even included a couple extra print cartridges. I just wish I hadn't spent the extra $20 dollars to expedite the shipping.$LABEL$0

Sports Science Projects: The Physics of Balls in Motion. Lots and lots of experiments in this science book. It contains black and white illustrations.

Teachers should read this one, also.$LABEL$1
Vice City vs. San Andreas. To people with neither Vice City nor San Andreas: Be sure to buy VC before SA. Vice City is far more enjoyable than San Andrea due to the great characters across the whole game, the missions and the overall feel of the game. Also VC as a city is far more entertaining than the drab and boring Los Santos. I have not yet got to the other 2 cities but the fake Miami is a hundred times better than the fake LA.The characters in VC are funnier, the missions are more interesting, and the overall experience gives the game a better feel whereas the characters in SA, across the board, are boring and lame and the missions are extremely tedious and often times boring.While San Andreas allows you to do more than Vice City, I guarantee you that you will have a far better time doing less in Vice City than you will doing endless missions and Sim City rip-offs in San Andreas.Definitely choose Vice City over San Andreas if you're looking for a fun game.$LABEL$1
Had to send it back. Unfortunately, this item didn't do what it was supposed to. After the first time, the button that is supposed to go down to show that the air has been vacuumed out stopped working. I called the company and they said this happens with grounds and that I should put the grounds in a bag....huh? Thought that was the point of this was that I could put the grounds directly in the canister. They sent me a whole list of things to do for it to work correctly. Bottom line is I think this would work great for beans....not so much for grounds.$LABEL$0

My Review Of 2 Girls In Love. The Incredibly True Adventure of 2 Girls in Love is a funny and touching love story about a rebellious lesbian tomboy who meets a nice and friendly teen girl at a auto fix-it shop and soon create a friendship. As the days passes, the two girls experience their friendship blossoming to a forbidden lesbian romance. The audio commentary by the director tells the word-for-word history of the film. The Incredibly True Adventure of 2 Girls in Love is a hearfelt comedy-drama that will leave no eye dry.$LABEL$1
Played for 5 minutes, then deleted. I'm not sure why I bought this game: I knew it would be bad. I guess I thought Harvey Smith made some great games, so maybe this was a rough gem. Nope! Just a boring, vanilla, limited-in-every-way-possible wack-a-mole shooter. The worst part is that the weapons have literally no kick or feedback, you might as well be using a laser pointer. Note to FPS designers: before you do ANYTHING ELSE be sure that it is fun and rewarding to aim and click the mouse button; if you fail at that, nothing else matters.This game fails at that most basic task, and thus it's not even worth discussing--too bad!$LABEL$0
Great deal for all the functions and pretty stylish as well... I have been wearing metal band watches for a long time, but now that I work in a hospital, I wanted something lighter and digital. So I purchased this watch with absolutely no expectation, since it was so cheap. After wearing it for about a week, I have realize that this watch is great! It is very simple to read and it has the seconds "pie" counter right in the middle. (which beats staring at a ticking seconds hand in my opinion) It is both analog and digital and it is pretty stylish for a 20 some odd dollar watch. I have been wearing it everyday since I got it.To sum it up:-Great deal considering all the functions-Light and stylish-Easy to read-Analog and digital$LABEL$1
Love this Headset, but It's Easily Breakable. Length:: 1:38 MinsI'm a fan of the Jabra 5020 headset -- it fits very well and comfortably around my ear and I've enjoyed good reception when connected to both my Treo 680 and iPhone. But I've gone through two models, and both have broken. The earpiece seems to be the weak link in this headset, as it's broken twice in my pocket (from not very rough treatment).$LABEL$0

Creative Doesn't Tell All You'd Want to Know. I really enjoy this player but I could have loved it if only I'd known what it's limitations were. The Creative web site does not make that obvious.Why buy an MP3 player? My goals were to listen to music, have the ability to download new music and occassionally listen to some books.Although this player has great battery life and plays music well enough, it does not allow you to take advantage of online music or book services. Older Creative devices do, but this one is not compatible with Napster.com or Audible.com.Why would a company make a new device and omit older features likely to become more important in the future, as napster and audible become more popular?When I voiced concern to Creative they responded promptly but offered no solution and no hope of one anytime soon.If you want to sign up with online services, looks like this device won't allow you to take advantage of some of the popular opportunities out there.$LABEL$1

Please save your $$ Buy K-9 Advantix II. I wouldn't normally write a bad review for a product, however, I really believe this is not worth the money. It essentially did little to nothing to kill or prevent fleas on our pets. I can safely say that most of the fleas on our pets did not die or even leave the animal. We tried this for a three month period and it was absolutely useless.In a comparison, we switched to K-9 Advantix II and the difference was night and day!Same animals, location, weather, etc...The Frontline Plus honestly did not work. I may have well administered tap water instead of Frontline Plus.The K-9 Advantix II worked almost immediately.PLEASESave your money! DO NOT WASTE IT on this product. I can't imagine how two products (FRONTLINE - ADVANTIX)claiming to do essentially the same thing, can be so vastly different with results. If I had to rely on Frontline, I would simply not use anything.$LABEL$0
Gets better after first two listens. I had previously said that this was derivative. Now I've gotten to the point that I'm actually used to it.Kid A was one of the best albums of all-time. This, while not as good, can still be enjoyable.It starts out with "Pact....", which is a more techno song from the album, as it isn't the best, but good first song. "Pulk/Pull Revolving Door" is great, despite the fact that the same chords are being used throughout the song. "Life In A Glass house" happens to be my favorite track, a dancy tune that has decent vocals. If you're not already interested, get The Bends, OK Computer, or Kid A. This isn't their best, but I like it.$LABEL$1
Living the So Called "Good Life" isn't so Good, after all... This story has a lot to teach all of us about what we assume wealth buys. It goes beyond what we have always been taught... "Money doesn't buy happiness" even though many of us have secretly believed..."if only I had that much money, I KNOW I could live happily ever after".....I suggest you read this funny and surprisingly insightful memoir and have your mind changed, just like mine was. I wish this former nanny all the best and would like to thank her for taking the risk to write this book. I will never look at Hollywood the same again.$LABEL$1
a great look into US-Indian policy and relations. i first came upon this book through my brother who studies archaeology at university of arizona. his american indian studies professor used this book as the textbook for the class. i read it cover to cover and found it very intruiging and fascinating (as well as horrifying). a great start for anyone whos interested in how the land your living on went from belonging to an indian tribe to becoming yours, and what happened to the people who owned it.$LABEL$1
Sounds like one long song.... I love Tabla drumming, but to be honest, this CD is too repetitive. It all sounds like one long, never ending track. Maybe it would be good as background when you're not really paying attention. Nope, no it wouldn't, because you'd be noticing how one track blends into the other into the other into the other. It's just too repetitive. Like this review.$LABEL$0

Best Matbreaker for cats or small dogs!. I've got a long - thick haired cat that always gets terrible hair mats each spring when she sheds. I've tried plenty of detangler and dematting combs, but couldn't find one that was easy to use (cats don't always stand still) and works fast. If I could have designed one myself, this would be it. It's small and fits well in your hand. The curved combs prevent jabbing the animal while they quickly and easily grab underneath the matt. Then as you pull, the inside blades safely and quickly slice the mat right out of the fur. It's fast and makes this chore SO much easier. The cat no longer minds the process. PS I only paid $10.00 plus shipping from KV Pet Supplies (via Amazon).$LABEL$1
Amazon should remove this product from their site.. I agree with all the bad reviews. The only positive thing I can say is that mine did not break the first time I used it. It broke the 4th time I used it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.$LABEL$0

"Impossible. . .things are happening every day!". Wow, some productions become the entertainment church of the soul, and this one is no exeption.Who can resist the story of a young non-regal born lass, destined to become an inhouse maid by her horrible wicked ancestors from her kind father's desolved marriage from his death, to eventually become royal princess! It almost becomes a tear jerker from Leslie Ann Warren's very convincing cry in "her own little corner."Actually, here, the wicked ancestors are a bit more comical in order to appear more clumsy, and ill mannered. Celeste Holm almost magnifys the extreme kind essence brought once before in "The Wizard Of Oz" Glinda, as the wonderful fairy god mother. The prince is fortunitely portrayed here, as not only handsome and dashing, but kind, considerate, and "in love."The musical score almost speaks for itself in catchy memorable tunes, and lyrics. And it ends with those very words, in my review heading!$LABEL$1

I got Shafted!!!!. When this movie came on T.V. many years ago, I recorded it, edited out the commercials and everything. So when it finally was released on D.V.D. I jumped at the chance to have a better quality version.I even gave my V.H.S. copy to my mother. Man, was I ever disappointed, the movie is missing critical scenes. Too many to even describe in this review!! I thought because [...] that that was the problem, but after reading so many other reviews that basically are saying the same thing, I can see I wasn't the only one who got shafted.And to make things worse, my mother won't give me the V.H.S. version back!!!$LABEL$0
Color by numbers. Genius would require more than transparent emulation and standard songwriting in my opinion.If you don't play music yourself or think that the ability to copy others or follow formulas has some value, then maybe this is for you.I am an advocate of judging how something sounds over where it fits in terms of creativity or obscurity. However, Mayer has crossed the line. Not only does he clearly seek to write songs just as he has heard and make his voice sound just as others, the voice he's chosen is that contrived dave matthewesque cacaphony.If you love coldplay and dave matthews and anything that sounds acoustic, then knock your socks off. But, if you've heard a couple Mayer songs and aren't into acoustic singer-songwriters enough to know a hack from a visionary, I would keep looking for an artist with at least the desire for creativity and unique personal expression.$LABEL$0
Puzzles plus Quests!. I was sort of skeptical about this game. I love a good RPG and I enjoy Bejewelled, but how the heck can you tie them together in a way that makes sense and doesn't get boring? Well, it happened and the result is this game. At first, it seems just like bejewelled but as you progress you realize that your color gems that you match corolate to the manna you need to cast spells, heal, and inflict mad damage upon your opponent. Some battles are harder than others, and you can protect yourself by donning armor and having other items in your inventory to reflect, dissipate, or otherwise shield you. A really unusual game, but it never gets boring!$LABEL$1
Where's the Physics?. I was hoping this video would excite my 14-year-old son about Physics. Unfortunately there's only the most token, and I mean token, mention of the physics of a roller coaster.

A good listen provided you like the genre.. This is no intro to electronica. Nor is it a hardcore beeping frenzy without any human touches. The opening track has nice vocal touches, and the the slack-jawed commentary on "Pretty Deyenol" make for that rare track that will make you laugh while you dance. Yes, there is ample dance material here; trouble will arise in finding anyone who has heard it and would therefore be able to dance, however. In the end 'tis not a classic but rather an enjoyably small step down.$LABEL$1
Very good headfone. I really recommend buy this headphone. Excellent sound output at this price.

Amazing in its depth and relevance.

Pretty terrible. I've worked through a number of language tapes, both for German and other languages, and Breakthrough German is one of the worst I've ever encountered.For starters, the primary narrator of the tape struck me as arrogant and condescending. But worse than that is that the program does little to aid retention of what's presented. There are few opportunites to repeat what you've just heard and no follow-ups to confirm that you've said the new term correctly.Also, the program appears to have been produced in the UK so some of the translations are a bit funky (for example "tschus" is translated as "cheerio")On the positive side, some of the dialogues on the tape appear to be genuine, real-life conversations that have been (surreptitiously?) recorded.As alternatives, I'd check out Pimsleur (very expensive but excellent) or Living Language.$LABEL$0
DO NOT BUY!. This product left a horrible white film on everything...plastic bowls, porcelain plates, silverware, glass glasses, plastic glasses-u get the point. It was so bad that I actually thought the kids put some kind of glue or a dirty paint brush with white paint on it in the dish washer. So I took all the dishes out of the dishwasher, scrubbed everything (still thinking it was the glue/paint, & yes that's how horrible this stuff was) & put the dishes back in the dishwasher for another cleaning not realizing they'd just come out with the white goopy film again, so back to hand scrubbing. Then I thought something was wrong with the dishwasher. I mentioned this to my husband & he suggested maybe it was the detergent since that was the only thing that changed. So off to the store for my old detergent and amazing, no more white film. I will never buy this stuff again. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PRODUCT. & shame on P&G because I'm sure this product was tested before they put it on the shelves!$LABEL$0

Surprising Discovery (talks about the end). Rory Cochrane and Mary McCormack were riveting. It's a talky movie with not a lot of action and no physical contact between the leads, but I couldn't turn away. It looked like the ending was going to be predictable, especially when it got down to the last 10 or 15 minutes. I thought the end would be Cochrane breaking the seal to hold his dying wife, choosing to die himself. Or maybe the last shot would be Cochrane on his side of the seal, alone. Nope, the movie turned it around. Cochrane was contaminated and sealed in by the military and gassed. Pretty amazing movie.$LABEL$1

Good Pictures; Very Little Said. I don't think you could really call this a book--it's more like a scrapbook or photo album. I learned perhaps 2 things about AJ that I hadn't heard before. It is definitely NOT the tell-all book it has been hyped to be--which is probably a good thing. The pictures are great--obviously mostly from her personal collection, as there are pics of Backstreet Boys sleeping, and at family celebrations. Very precious and priceless picture of Brian and Nick in younger years sound asleep on a couch. There is one picture of AJ in the bathtub--not too revealing--thank goodness. All in all, not a big price to pay for some really great pictures, but not much of anything else.$LABEL$0

Ichabod Crane Revisited. SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999), starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, and Jeffrey Jones, combines horror, suspense, and comedy brilliantly. This is a loosely adapted version of Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." Depp plays a bumbling constable who relies upon the latest scientific methods to figure out who is responsible for a series of beheadings in New York's Hudson valley. Directed by Tim Burton, the film looks terrific with exquisite sets and evocative cinematography. If Burton takes liberties with the Irving classic, he succeeds in creating a superior black comedy with his distinctive trademark. And look for a surprise cameo in the role of the Headless Horseman.$LABEL$1

Good racquet. Compared to some of the other racquets I've used, the soft layer is thinner on this racquet, yet the blade is still plenty sticky. As a result, you don't get quite the spin with this as you do on other racquets. However, it will spin plenty. And what is lost in spin is made up for in speed. I've liked it and so have other players who have played a game or two with it.The only fault I find with it, is that I wonder of the durability. There are some cracks on the edge from hitting the table and I wish the manufacturer wouldn't make the thingermajigger (clear lucite) in the handle. It's cool and all, but I think durabilty would be better served to leave it off.$LABEL$1
I love this CD!. I'm only 20 years old, but I've loved this movie pretty much since birth, and my mom had the soundtrack when I was younger, so I grew up listening to the pioneering new wave of the 80's. I've purchased my own copy and love it to this very day! I'm still looking to buy the 2nd soundtrack, but for some reason can't seem to find it anywhere. I know it was on Amazon a while back, but was very expensive (almost $40) and there were only about 4 available. There's some great songs on that one as well, in fact, I might like that one just a little bit more. But definitely check this CD out! It's like totally tubular, for sure!$LABEL$1
My first heart rate monitor. As a runner I was happy to receive this as a gift. It's great to be able to monitor your heart rate as you exercise. This unit comes with several extras that are really nice -- such as the fitness quotient that calculates your fitness based on age, weight and activity level. It also has a bicycle mount, which is something most don't include. The watch is well-designed -- I get compliments and questions about it -- and the controls are logically arranged and very usable.$LABEL$0

NOT THE CATWOMAN WE KNOW. First off 1)Catwoman in the comics was white not black like others have written.2)In the Adam west Burt ward Batman series she was white Julie Newmar- black Eartha Kitt- and the 1966 movie white- Lee meriwether.3) Halle berry is half black half white. But that is not why I gave it 2 stars I would not care if she was all black or latin or ect.... I gave it 2 stars because you can not change a comic characters orgin this much and still think people will come and see it. Granted Catwoman has changed over the years but somethings have always stayed the same She is a catburgler with no super powers.

needs Karaoke machine!. Nowhere in the product description does it say that you have to play this disc on a karaoke machine in order to get the on-screen lyrics -- but that's exactly the case. I purchased this and several others for my son to use in a DVD player with a plug-in microphone, and, while it plays the music on the DVD player, it does not have on-screen lyrics. I am extremely disappointed in the product description.$LABEL$0
Love it!. I love it and my son loves it. It fits perfectly with his mouth, and is easy for him to hold. It's 100% silicone, so nothing can hurt his mouth. I also found that when he is having a bad teething day, if I rub a little bit of his teething gel on it, it really helps. He would chew on it all day if I let him:)$LABEL$1
NOT Non-Stick. This pan is NOT Non-Stick. Both sides stick terribly. I've been attempting to use this pan for over a year now with the same issue each time. I've tried high, medium and low heat. Each time I want to flip it I have to open it and scrape the egg off the bottom, which defeats the purpose of the pan. It also leaks egg onto my stove every time I flip it.$LABEL$0

More than Just another Great Nancy Drew Book. There is more here than just a good story for children when reading these books. I have an inquisitive 7-year old who has loved reading a few of the Nancy Drew books. (It was also an enjoyable walk down memory lane with one of my favorite childhood book series. It's a good mystery story and one of my favorites of the series). This book introduced the Amish people to my daughter and made for good discussions after we read a few chapters every night. The series also brings to light how things were "back then". Telephones with cords, big convertible cars, and a unique vocabulary. I love that we can download the book for immediate reading. My daughter and I pick out the books together and dive right in. The ebook is exactly how the real book is with the illustrations included. My daughter looked forward to the pictures and scrutinized how each one was drawn. More than sharing the reading time, I love the discussions that come from reading these books.$LABEL$1
Take off eh!. Santa brought me this DVD for christmas 2003. I stuck it into my computer DVD player today, sat back, and immersed myself into the sounds of RUSH. And amazing sounds they where. Considering that this concert could have been halted because of previous rain or the equipment showing up half a day late, it was amazing how they pulled it off so smoothly. The band once again shows why they are the kings of progressive rock. Song after song are performed flawlessly. And to top it off the fans where amazing. A unsuspected bonus of owning this DVD is the documentary DVD that comes with it. It was not only educating, but hilarious. Those guys have quite the sense of humour, and if you don't like them, then Take off eh!$LABEL$1
This is religion!. I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunatly the authors were unable to rise above the technology/process wars. The words "In Our Opinion" or simalar statements occur on every other page. If you happen to be in disagreement with the opinions reading this book is torture.I am afraid this will hurt WWISA, the goal of creating a viable Software Architecture Profession can only be achieved if we stay independent of the wars. This book, being visable evidence of the organiztions existance will give readers a false impression of the WWISA.$LABEL$0
Another Satisfied Customer. I bought the Delorme Earthmate USB for my laptop because I couldn't afford a GPS system for my vehicle. So, I figured $130 ain't a bad price. So far, I have used it in my area. Knowing that GPS is not 100% accurate, I feel the Earthmate USB is accurate enough to figure out where you are and to find your way. Only downfall is the mapping software. The main roads are fairly accurate. The side roads have less to be desired. Because of that, this product only gets 4 out of 5 stars.$LABEL$1

Painful. Being a Styx fan for a number of years I was excited to see the remaining members of the group reunite for another studio album. However, after hearing this sub-par effort from the Styx makes me wish they would have forgone the effort and stuck to their day jobs.With pointless lyrics and musical arrangements that put you to sleep it is safe to say that the magic that this band once had has gone the way of the dodo.This is a perfect example that sometimes living in the past is not such a bad thing. If you feel the need to hear Styx wipe off your turntable and listen to some of the old classics."Brave New World" makes their single "Music Time" sound like Beethoven.$LABEL$0
no longer effective. this product is not longer effective since they removed the cortisone. I did give it a try for a few months for psoriasis, but it was was basically just greasy stuff on my elbows and knees that did nothing. bought this other stuff, "MG 217" and it completely cleared it up in 4 weeks. amzing stuff!! maybe the freederm works for other conditions, but not for psoriasis.$LABEL$0
Never outdated!. Chorale singing is just not around much anymore. Thank God for the technology that has kept this beautiful music alive for our enjoyment. Robert Shaw Chorale was the best. Also, some of the sacred songs are getting harder and harder to find, and here they are on this one CD.$LABEL$1
This is pretty terrible.... This cd is a flaccid mess. You've already heard the only two decent songs ("Survivor" and "Independent Women Part I"), so there's no need to buy this. It's mostly just embarassing, cliche-riddled, off-tempo tripe, especially "Nasty Girl," "Bootylicious," "Apple Pie ala Mode," and "Brown Eyes." It appears as if all that earlier "writing on the wall" was done in vain; too bad when Destiny's Child cleaned house last year, they kicked out all the talented members.$LABEL$0
Wasn't too impressed. I tried this headset with my LG mobile phone, and I constantly had a hard time hearing the person on the other line. I also didn't like the "switchboard operator" style headset -- too much of a hassle for use on the road, and too big to easily fit in the glove box. Might be ok for someone at an office desk. I switched to a Body Glove over-the-ear style system -- better sound, more compact and convenient.$LABEL$0
Terrible movie. I had to see some mumblecore titles for a class. I thought this could be the worst movie ever made, until I saw Hannah Takes the Stairs. This is the 2nd worst movie ever made. No story, no plot, uninteresting characters. You'll honestly get more enjoyment listening to your dishwasher run for the length of this movie.$LABEL$0
Disappointed. I desperately wanted my daughter to enjoy a yummy chocolate chip cookie. She is allergic to nuts and eggs, among other things. We eat pretty healthy and I kept an open mind, but these were just gross. My 22 month old wouldn't take more than 1 bite. My husband and I couldn't even eat more than one. :($LABEL$0
Truly stunning ending. The end of this movie is so well done that, despite it being an animated action film, it nearly brought a tear to my eye. Mr. Freeze in the animated series is so wonderfully tragic, and voiced with an incredibly haunting performance by Michael Ansara.At the end, when Freeze has lost everything, but sees on the news that all that he did and sacrificed was not in vain, the music crescendos and you realize that he can rest in peace, even if he never sees his wife again. As someone who loves tragic love stories and happy endings, this movie ended perfectly for me, tragic and joyous at the same time.$LABEL$1
A really good mouse. I purchased this as a gift for a friend. He had the exact same one but his dog decided to eat the cable. He liked it so much he asked for the exact same one even when I offered to buy him one that was more expensive. He has been using this model for a couple of years.$LABEL$1

South Africa - general overview. The geography of South Africa is the main focus of this title. Within this subject too many topics are touched on for a 32 page book that is nearly 50% pictures. Each topic, including weather, plants, animals, industry, people, etc., is given a very quick overview but none are given much depth. A glossary and index are incuded. A pronounciation guide for non-English words would have been helpful. For someone interested in general information about this part of the world this is an OK choice. For someone looking for research material - keep looking.$LABEL$0
Wait until the end..... Yeah, normally, when you say that its followed with a "....you wont believe what happens" Not the case, what I liked about the end, was the excellent rock playing as the credits rolled, AND the fact that the movie was done. I absolutely hated this movie. I felt like it had a cast filled with supporting actors, no heavy hitters anchoring it down. Now, this movie is compared with ID4, Alien, War of the Worlds, whatever...NO WAY... ID4 has real heart, characters you care about, they have an affect on the outcome. Alien is cinematic classic, this doesnt even come close to touching Alien...so forget that comparison! Lastly, War of the Worlds, brilliant, beautiful, scary and like nothing I'd seen, this movie doesnt touch IT either. Skyline largely follows in the footsteps are larger more successful sci fi movies, and gives you nothing new. Do yourself a favor, dont substitute the originals. You'll be happier watching the ones that came first.$LABEL$0
great acting, great story. This is an autobiographical story about James M. Barrie andhow he came to write the play and novel "Peter Pan".It is also about death and orphans: the English, as Oliver Twist by Dickens points out, had trouble dealing with orphans.Barrie had a warm open heart and found a fantasy world for childrenthat appears to be timeless and universal.There is always a place in the heart of children for pirates, Indians and fairies.There is a real contrast in the emotional approach to death taken here and that in another recent movie:The Bucket ListI think that both have good acting by great actors,but one seems to be about the "me first" approach to lifeand this one is about living with death for both the livingands the survivors. I think that both are "sentimental",but this approach seems better.$LABEL$1
Plenty of Ice But No Zebra. Maclean lost his battle with alcoholism later in life, and it adversely affected his output. His novels became shorter and their characterization flatter, and in Athabasca, he presents one character's alcoholism in virtually a positive light. The plot of this story is forgettable too and there's only about ten pages near the end where 'master of suspense' can be applied to the writing. A sad decline for someone who was the Tom Clancy of his day and is virtually forgotten barely fifteen years after his death. As for this book, read Ice Station Zebra if you want to play in the snow!$LABEL$0
The Best Bond movie in the universe. Out of all Bond movie's, this one is my favorite. Except for the fact that Kissy, the bond girl is only in the movie for about 20 minutes. It is so dumb why they cut the other one off. Well anyways, a space capsule was captured and hijacked. The Americans think the Soviets did it. Next, another capsule is captured and believe that the Americans did this to retaliate. The tension between the two could create another war. James Bond is sent to Japan to investigate. There, he finds the evil leader of SPECTRE has done this so when the 2 most military countrys destroy eachother. When that has happened, Blofeld will take opporitunity to seize the world. There was a lot of action in this movie. Like.1. The Space capsule hijack2. The building fight.3. The car chase and helicopter4. Little Nelie chase/fight5. The dock gunfight6. The final finale, the crater battle.$LABEL$1
sweet deal. If you want a reliable player to jog with, runs on regular batteries, has no hard drive, uses musicmatch to make play lists and is easy to use, then look no more. I've used this one about 5x/week for over a year and it works great. I get about 15 hours per AAA battery and have had no problems with this one. If you like the idea of not having to worry about hard drive failure and battery issues with the iPod, this is a sweet deal. One suggestion, pick up some better earphones to maximize the sound quality of the player.$LABEL$1
Not so much. This worked on my dachshund about 3 times and then she decided the noise wasn't quite annoying enough to stop her from barking. Another problem was that if I tossed my keys on the table it was sitting on or my children squealed while playing, it set it off too. So we had to be quiet around the thing. I continued to change the batteries in hope that it would eventually work on her and, in about a month, I had gone through 3 battery changes. If I had continued to use it, I would have been buying batteries out the wazoo. All in all, it was a good idea but didn't work at all for my dog.$LABEL$0

A Jewel Among the Rocks. My wife and I are voracious readers and often settle for books that are OK, but not noteworthy. Every so often a jewel pops out of nowhere and The Wild Trees is just such a book.We were early readers of The Life of Pi, and feel this book is just such a read. Editorially, they are miles apart, but both books surprise you by just being wonderful and refrshing.Within 30 pages of the start, you will be breathless, and then the character development begins. There is the poor son of a billionaire, a wonderful love story and of course the trees. The wonderful magnificent trees. And, it's all true.I just bought 12 copies to send to my reading friends and just felt it would be a good thing to let others know.Enjoy.$LABEL$1
The Nay Sayers are WRONG!. Setzer has ROCKED since the Stray Cats and the new BSO album is no different. Brian and crew update the rockabilly and swing sound and it's great! Those who say the Setzer Orchestra is worthless have no appreciation of adaptation of musical styles into a VERY enjoyable SWWWWIIIIINNNGGGGIN' Setzer style. The originals are no less great, but the remakes are fun, and the originals are great! If only more CD's were as much fun!$LABEL$1
Marginal. This collection of sentences and catch phrases is VERY weak on technical details and VERY heavy on the diatribe. In several instances, it is down right incorrect when referencing history. This book may fit the needs of a poli. sci. type, but it is less than a dust collector when it comes to those working in the fields of IT/IW/IA. As a 2 decade professional in the field, take my recommendation and avoid this book if you are looking for anything beyond recycled political phrases related to IW.$LABEL$0
Will only be helpful for a few.. The book was NOT what I was expecting based on prior reviews. This is NOT a guide to life organizing and prioritizing but rather the author's idea of handling office incoming mail, a filing reminder system for phone calls to be made and work to be done, keeping things one needs to share with another individual in a central location, and scheduling and consolidating that sharing. For those who don't need a computer to do their job, have a memory like a sieve, or are super disorganized and don't know where to begin to start, this might be helpful, otherwise, save your money. His ideas are only practical in a low volume paperwork environment and with those who have non-technical professions. Some kind of portable, daily planner or calendar or a computer syncing PDA is much more practical.$LABEL$0
Rocks........As all Metallica does. when I first found out that Metallica was going to perform with an orchestra I was a little hesitant. Who would have thought Metallica would ever enter the same building as an orchestra, much less perform with one! When I first played it I was blown away with how much the other instruments accually "filled" Metallica's sound giving a new edge and fullness. Where some of the Metallica songs started to get bland or the same, the orchestra just creates such a particular sound that it sounds sooooo much better. It has all of the greats from some of the older stuff as well as some new songs. The only drawback I did notice was on the back of the cd. It lists the songs with only part of their name, this was a little misleading when purchasing from a store. Other than that, this cd is a must-have for anyone that has ever heard any Metallica. Even if you havent, this cd is for anyone with a need for metal.$LABEL$1

Good general guide on entering the industry. I've been working in the field of game audio on the content side for about 5 years. I got this book as I was starting out and I found it a quick, easy read that offered alot of helpful insight and pretty much everything Marks said has held true in my experience. There are people complaining here that this book doesn't offer deep technical information or insight on how to provide content or help with audio programming and that's true. Maybe the title could have been clearer - it's more an idea of what game audio is about and what it's like to work in that field. But if that's what you're looking for, it's a quite worth reading and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know how to break into the industry on the audio side.$LABEL$1
This a must for every preacher to read.. This book captivates you. Spureon stood out as a preacher and pastor far above most who ever pastored. Dr.Dummand has given a vivid description of the many faceted sides of the great preacher. When I finished the book I felt like it should be studied rather than just read. You will love the many tidbits of fascinating information about the man and his ministry. Mr. Spurgeon was involved in controversary quite often. The author tells how and why. Spurgeon took a strong stand on the fundamentals of the faith when many others were not as open. There are many paralells to prominent pastors of today. It will especially encourage and strengethen younger pastors. As I read the book two thing struck me. How I wish I had read this 50 years ago. Then how we need more his tribe today. Every Christian would be blessed and profited by this book.$LABEL$1

Stories are too short, not worth the money. I just bought the single DVD version and was psyched to see a dark Batman animated DVD coming out. Being a big fan, I had to get it. Bottomline, its not worth the money. Rent it first. The first story is horrible. The animation is off; Batman looks different in every story as does Bruce Wayne. Each story is only 12 minutes long so there's not enough to satisfy you. They'd be better off having fewer stories and making them longer. They probably just released this for marketing since the movie comes out next week. Too bad they didn't give us anything quality and just fluff to "satisfy" until the movie comes out. Avoid this if you can.$LABEL$0

Amazing speed. This little device is amazing. Very fast and lots of options. Good software, and lots of free stuff comes with it.

high on shock but don't expect to take anything away.... the book is definitely a page turner, but don't look for anything to really touch you with the characters that surrounded his life, or in his complete lack of any reflection on the events and people that shaped his childhood. unlike say, a Sedaris story - there doesn't seem to be much humanity in this memoir. I don't know - maybe that's not exactly the point of this book (or it IS!) but by the time I read the exerpt from his book Dry - I was convinced that he's only in it for the satisfaction of grossing his reader's out....$LABEL$0
A work of historic importance.. Der Graf von Gleichen will never be remembered as an opera "gem", however the Cincinnati-College Conservatory of Music's beautifully sung recording of this work is a must for any opera lover's library. The opera was composed during the last days of Schubert's short life and was not finished before his death. Therfore, Der Graf had never been staged let alone recorded by any arts organization of significance. Enter CCM. The singers and orchestra bring to life a work that history has set aside. Schubert's compositional strengths are evident in his hundreds of song treatments, and the arias in this opera reflect those strengths. For instance, the role of Suleika, gorgeously sung by the warm yet innocent soprano of Gwendolyn Coleman, is highlighted by arias resembling the Schubertlieder for which she is named. Ms. Coleman, by the way, is just one of numerous talented singers on this recording who are gracing the concert halls of the world. To hear them, buy this CD!$LABEL$1
I really wanted to love this album. After the lackluster 14 Shades of Grey, I really hoped that Staind's new album could blow me away like they did the first time I heard them in my local music store. Unfortuantly, I realize that the band I love doesn't exist anymore. At least I still have Tormented, Dysfunction and the memories of the times I've seen them live. Now, this isn't an awful album but there's nothing that can separate them from the rest of the sludge you hear on the radio. If you want to hear music that really rocks, do yourself a favor and pick up a Local H album.$LABEL$0
Best of the best!. This is the ONLY pregnancy book you will need. Before I got pregnant and during my pregnancy, I got at least 10 pregnancy books. The only other one that I also found helpful was "What to Expect," but this book is WAY better. Don't waste your money on other books. I regret getting all the "natural birth" and "natural" methods books, they were not scientifically proven (in fact, sometimes outright dangerous!). Go with the Mayo Clinic. You, your husband, and your baby will be glad. : )$LABEL$1
An unfortunate misstep.. A show that was to define an entire new genre in its first season goes out on in the exact fashion it sought to lampoon, punctuated by an ending that invalidates the premise that was at the very heart of the show. This transparent attempt to generate revenue from an extended treatment of it's "shocking" ending is neither surprising nor warranted. Best to turn the spigot off here and redirect those hard earned funds toward something that kept its integrity and stayed true to its heart, such as Shout Factory's "My So Called Life" or the pre-Star Trek J.J. Abrams signature, "Felicity".$LABEL$0
Didn't work out of box; rude customer service. After a week the receiver still hasn't picked up a signal. I've tried it both in the car (w/ the auto adapter unit) and in the boombox but have yet to get a signal. XACT customer service is unfriendly and fairly difficult to work with...they don't seem to believe me that I can't "acquire a signal". After a few emails and a phone call I get to return the unit at my expense and wait an unspecified amount of time for a replacement. Meanwhile, I get to pay for a service (SIRIUS) I can't use. Try JVC, those who are using JVC receivers around here don't seem to have any problems.$LABEL$0
Ordering process screwed up. When ordering this item, I was informed that it could not be shipped to a post office box so I gave my physical address.

When item was very late (didn't ever arrive) I contacted seller only to find out they could not understand a rationale English sentence.

Delicious!. I've been buying these since they appeared in my area, and they are delicious. The portion size is acceptable, considering these are only 100 calories. The cookies are nice and minty and have a chocolate coating on the bottom of each cookie.Unlike say, the Oreo 100 calorie packs, these actually taste like grasshoppers, only smaller. Unlike regular grasshoppers though, the 100 calorie pack version is trans fat free.Overall, these are a great example of what a 100 calorie pack should be.$LABEL$1

This is the worst video i have ever seen.. Curtis Mitchel speaks better that he can play. He shows only a few licks from the vast collection of Floyd songs and the licks that he shows are also not played like the original.

I am a beginer player with 5 years of playing strictly by ear and without technique or music theory and even i can copy Floyd songs better than what Curt plays in the video.$LABEL$0
i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. i love this bed set. it is soooooooooo cute. the only downfall to it is that the comforter doesnt fit the crib, it is too small in length, and too wide in width. the fitted sheet for it fits great though. when i went to buy it at the store located in vernon hills, il., they me that they were going to discontinue this set, and wouldnt sell me thier floor model, so i had to go to the schaumburg, il store which was totally out of my way and a pain in the behind to get to. so if youre looking to buy it, call the store beforehand to see if it is in stock or if theyll sell their floor model to you.$LABEL$1
Mono operation with Secret Service Throat Mic.. I assumed that the term Mobile meant radio and not cellular technology. I was able to confirm the loopback presented when the ring and tip3(of 3) are shorted, a poor design indeed.In any case the pins for io/out on this and likely other devices meant to work with radios, like Visar Series and TalkAbout, are reversed... perhaps to avoid this problem?Some comments above indicate this is mono, I can't confirm or deny that.Here are some links I found helpfull:[...]This /may/ match the expected input of this adapter:[...]These are the same and NOT like this adapter:[...][...][...]$LABEL$0

The least exciting of the four solo albums!. Gene Simmons seem to believe his solo album was the best, as well as the most liked. I would say that Simmons recorded the least exciting album of the four Kiss members. The opening "Radioactive" is the album's highlight. The Beatles sounding "See you tonight" and the quite rocking "Burning up with fever" are better than the average, but when it comes to the closing "When you wish upon a star", I certainly wish that Simmons would shut up - it's plain awful. The overall impression is that it's rather lame and the material is in fact quite weak more than occasionally. Simmons sure have a talent for business, but he surely think too much of his musical skills.$LABEL$0

All aboard the crazy train. good DVD that looks into the behind the scenes of big wave riding and photography.It also looks into the circus that follows.I bought the DVD because I am interested in big wave surfing and bodyboarding and i think the crew that laird surfs with have covered all bases.There isn't much more big wave stuff than other similar titles, but they have shown new angles and ideas.Helicopter tow surfing, etc. etc.I recommend this DVD to anyone keen on Big wave tow surfing, big wave riding in general, people who like and are mature enough to ride different equipment depending on the day.I also recommend this DVD if you are a fan of Laird Hamilton and his approach to wave riding.$LABEL$1
Great for the money. I had one hair dryer for 20 years and since then I have been going through one a year. This is the best yet. Leaves hair with nice shine and soft. Last 2 I bought left hair fried and dull after first few uses. Daily use now for 4 months or so and still works great. Unfortunately can't expect to get that 20 years out of anything anymore. 1-2 years would be great on a 20 dollar hair dryer I think.$LABEL$1

A Big Disappointment. I had a lot of hopes for this book from the title and the customer reviews.It started well enough with an account of the accident that led to his epic run.However,the book for the most part reads like a travelogue of the Grand Canyon and a history of the land,explorers,settlers and Indians that went through there decades and centuries before. I don't really care about all the historical detail. Frankly, it got to be very boring. Boring to the point I couldn't finish it. As a lifelong runner I'm always on the search for great running books,this definitely is one to avoid.$LABEL$0
Something for Everyone!. I usually am hesitant to buy these types of books - because I live in a colder climate (zone 3-4) there are usually not many combinations, styles, etc. to choose from out of an "all inclusive" book. Not the case here! There were plenty of plans and ideas for all zones and everything was very comprehensive in drawings and text. Just within the first few minutes of looking at it I had several ideas for my yard. What's also nice is that it covers everything from small spaces that need just a few plants to fill in to large areas that need coverage. I will definately be referring to this book AND sharing this book for a long time to come!$LABEL$1
Research?. I downloaded this book to read on holiday in Greece. After several chapters I became rather disenchanted and indeed rather cross. The author chose Ashburton, England as her 'remote' village. I lived there in 1969 and have been back there recently so was pleased to discover the story using the village as a setting. However it lost its credibility when she describes a busload of 50 Japanese tourists stepping out. That will never happen in sleepy Ashburton, we don't have sidewalks, and the streets are not arranged in 'blocks'. Police have not been referred to as 'bobbies' since the 1950's and the final straw came when Douglass ordered scones and describes slathering the scone in clotted cream with no mention of jam - sacrilege! It may seem petty but it would be like me choosing a remote town in America and describing pavements instead of sidewalks etc. Write about what you know or do the research. It may have been a good story but I will never know.$LABEL$0
disappointing. Had heard good things about Louis CK. But what a disappointment. I forget which aspect of his crudeness turned me off. Was it animal cruelty? Hard to remember, but I know I don't want any more Louis CK.$LABEL$0
Infinity Blech. Briefly, I could not get through 30% of this book; the characters were pasteboard, the settings were bland (terraformed worlds tend to be like that), and the pace dragged (as far as I read)....I peeked ahead and was dismayed that the main character was still stumbling over the same plots devices and still mumbling the same drek about longing for her long-disappeared sister. Jeez, that got old quick!How could a former Navy officer write a science-fiction chick-flick-book? Must have been really boring checking customs IDs in North Dakota.So I thought I would advise anyone potentially considering..but my hands are getting heavy..must warn readers..can't keep typing..eyelids lowering..head..sinking..ZZZzzzzzzzzzzz$LABEL$0

A brilliant idea. So many of reviewers are saying this toy is inappopriate and exposing girls to things they shouldn't know yet. What?! This isn't "Kama Sutra Barbie" we're dealing with. If you're afraid a pregnant doll will scar your kids psychologically, what happens if a a friend's mother expects a baby or they see pregnant animals? One reviewer said these issues are too mature for 6 - 11 year olds. I was between those ages when I started my period, I knew what pregancy was (my mum devilvered my little sdister when I wasn't even two) - too mature, I think not.I had a similar pregnant doll when I was a small girl (I'm 15 now), but unfortunately I cannot remember the manufacturer or the name of the doll. What I do remember is that it was my absoloute favourite doll. When I was very young I had trouble imagining the concept of a baby in my mother's belly and it helped enormously. I had a wonderful time with that doll. You know what? It hasn't made me get knocked up!$LABEL$1
Does not work on our 14" and 18" bicycles. This kickstand did not install on either of my kids' bicycles - one is 18" and the other 14". It was too long on the shortest setting, and the design of how to install it does not fit with the frame shape of either bicycle. Very disappointed! It is also very stiff. WD40 helped some, but I doubt my 5.5 year old would be able to use the kickstand on her own even after the WD40.$LABEL$0

Nice, but odd pockets. Jacket fits well, and keeps me warm. Pay attention to the size. I got a Medium and it's almost too big. The only thing I've noticed is the pockets zip UP to open. I've never had that before so it will take some getting used to, Unless it was actually made wrong...$LABEL$1

One of my favorites. This was my first Jaci Velazquez CD and I really like it. There is one song that is very worshipful (Adore), there are several that make me feel grateful for all God has done (Imagine me without you, He's my Saviour). I love the "latin sound" in several songs. Overall, it is a declaration that God is there, (You don't miss a thing I do), and that He loves us.$LABEL$1
Not a classic. I got this and I'm sorry Biggie fans but Ready to Die drops a big stinking load on this CD. I skip most tracks on here because he went crazy with the club songs but his storytelling is above par.$LABEL$1

excellent book. two years ago I bought this book, and at first I didn't know what to do with it.

I was amazed, but I must say I am glad I bought it.$LABEL$1
No aerobics, and QUIET PLEASE!!. I bought this tape thinking that I would get an intense abdominal toning session, and instead, there is long stretch of aerobics at the beginning. I am not a big fan of aerobics in the first place, due to the chirping and ranting of most instructors and the idiotic and pointless flailing that it usually entails. Okay, fine. I don't do aerobics, and limit my cardio workout to sensible things like walking or commuting by bike or swimming. This leads me to the second complaint I have about the video, and that is the leader's incessant chatter throughout. Why can't they just COUNT! I find myself actually yelling at them to SHUT UP!! Which, actually works my abs a little harder, so there might be a reason for this annoying banter after all. At one point, the third instructor actually changes the exercise in mid-execution. I thought this was very sloppy. But, I must say, the workout itself is satisfying and produces results, if you can stand it.$LABEL$0

Loved It![.]. I read this book AFTER visiting Celebration, Florida. I was interested in more background info and details. We walked down the Main St of town and thought "this is nice" but not very practical. Practical is shopping in [local store] and buying groceries in[local store]. The days of the corner grocer and little hardware store on Main St are long gone so I was curious about the opinions of the author and his neighbors. This is a great story - it seems to be unbiased and does provide good background info on the town without making it boring. The author nicely weaves little stories about the town or tales of the neighbors into this "documentary" to keep the story moving. I know this book is not for everybody but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It's also a great commentary on planned communities in general although I'm not sure that was what the authors intended.$LABEL$1

A Formative Look at Hemingway. Biographers have tough assignments when writing books about their subjects: how to fill a reasonable number of pages with the entire life of an individual? Even someone who's not famous or historically significant would likely have enough material about their life to fill a book. Michael Reynolds as a biographer gives in, and instead concentrates on only a sliver of Hemingway's life. This decision made for good reading and one should end up understanding that it was Hemingway's earlier years, as is the case for most of us, which ended up shaping his life and death. The book also provides an interesting look at prewar American society, in particular, the growing and changing middle class. This supporting content often serves as a break from the sometimes cumbersome biographical text.$LABEL$0

My first Calphalon Commercial cookware. This is my very first piece of Calphalon cookware. I have been cooking for well over 50 years, and it is far superior to any other item of cookware I have ever used. You can use very low heat, food does not stick to the bottom of the pot, and it requires very little stirring or watching. My single complaint is that it is quite heavy, and lifting it from the stove while it is filled requires a bit of strength. Having a second "helper" handle on the opposite side of the pan would be a good thing for older persons, like me, so we could use both hands.I really wish I had cookware like this at least 20 years ago!$LABEL$1
Overpriced and a bit quirky. Found this wristband pin extractor/installer to function with a few quirks It seems to jam when used to pull pins and the installation of pins is a bit tricky, but functions. The spring loaded height adjustment was useless and only made the job more intricate and complicated. Construction is adequite and it comes with extra pin die extraction bits. Too bad it doesn't include other sizes or a hold-down machanism for the wristband during use. Over priced.$LABEL$0
A wonderful debut.. This is truly a terrific first effort by this brilliant band. All of their eclectic glory is revealed from the start. Where their sound would mature over subsequent albums all of the ingredients that made them such a unique band are present. Brilliant musicianship, dynamic compositions, stellar vocals and harmonies and strong production are all evident. Classical, jazz, English folk, blues and rock all inform their sound. One of the finest bands in British progressive music. Highly recommended...Simon$LABEL$1
needed more work. The writer is obviously a serious poker player, but the book is not well-organized. The result isn't very reader-friendly. I'd be very eager to see a reworked second edition, though.$LABEL$0
Annoying.... This book started out annoying and ended annoying. I understand their whole image that they're trying to portray (or at least I think I do), and that's fine, but there is just way too much cussing in this book. I really couldn't stand it.That being said, I knew most of the information in this book already, but some of it was informative for me. I liked that. I like being informed without all the derogatory language though.As you can tell, the language really bothered me. Blah...The other thing that bothered me, and I'm not sure if it was a joke or not, is they go on and on about how bad it is to drink soda, how bad it is to eat junk food, artificial sweeteners are horrible, blah, blah, blah. Everyone knows that already. Duh. But then somewhere toward the end, they say something like, "Don't blame us if you see us doing beer bongs. We're only human. It's all about balance." Huh? Okay...I could go on and on, but bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.$LABEL$0
Wonderful science memoir. This book details the author's childhood love of chemistry, from spectacular reactions to his study of the periodic table.He tells the stories of some early chemists who discovered elements.

a revolution business can manage. yeah, revolutionary language and a new look for a trusted strategy guru. Hamel captures the revolutionary vibe in a better-looking-than-most business book, but stops one step short of being truly revolutionary.

Not great art, but great nonetheless. I enjoy all kinds of art. Highbrow this ain't but the extreme ludicrous-ness of the circumstances that befall these characters is so over-the-top, and the characters so likable and engaging with all their flaws, and the sheer joy of the ensemble playing, led masterfully by the smooth and daring Bradley Cooper, made this a must-have for my collection. I laughed out loud watching it alone in my room and plan to watch it over again and again over time when I need a lift or a two-hour vacation. Zack G. Practically steals the show with the character's off-the-wall thought processes but everyone shines, except for poor Justin Bartha who doesn't have much to do, a function of the plot. As memorable a film as any that were paraded on the red carpet at the glitzy awards ceremonies for the year 2009.$LABEL$1

Poorly researched. While entertaining at times, this book is obviously not done by a serious historian. Most of her material is taken from secondary sources. In one chapter, the material is actual a book report, because the author only uses 1-2 sources, and constantly quotes from one. I finally sold it to a used book store, because as a history buff, I was ashamed to have it in my collection. More People Magazine than history I'm afraid.$LABEL$0

Boring. How does an exciting musician that has brought so much to the music industry become such a settled boring clone? The only answer can be that money has changed the man.

A Brilliant Piece of Work. Okay, as a non spiritual person, rather i am just a total movie nut, i must say that this film was beautifully done. Regardless of your faith, or how you choose to express it, the movie blends impressive scenery with heart-wrenchingly superb acting. Jeremy Sisto as Jesus after his his former roles, was quite a thrill to experience. I found myself watching him throughout the movie and saying to myself "that would be the face of Jesus." The simple kindness and joy in his expressions, the truth so eloquently expressed. The additional cast leading a truly enjoyable landscape upon which this film was carried, left me wanting so much more, i ran out and bought the remaining bible movies made by TriMark. So, whether you are a religous person looking for a new face to add to your ideas of the bible, or just a movie-holic like myself, i truly believe this movie is worth watching.$LABEL$1
Essential 80s fare. In the age of "Porky's", "Revenge Of The Nerds", "Police Academy" (what were we thinking???), and "Airplane" came this underrated comedy gem.You don't have to like Goldie Hawn, but the supporting cast makes it work--Wesley Snipes, Woody Harrelson, Nipsey Russell, and James Keach--and the jokes still work a couple decades later. Dig LL Cool J's theme song (pre-dating his work on yet another football film--"Any Given Sunday), and let your memory work overtime.$LABEL$1
These ear buds suck. Worse than skull candy from target. I hate how these last such a short time. My Skull Candy usually last longer than this, this ear buds lasted like for a month.

Exceptional Lyrics + Great Music = An Awesome CD. Take one listen to the Crown Jewels' sophomore album and you'll be hooked.The brothers Conte, singer/guitarist Steve and bassist John, know how to deliver a great album. Early '90s rock fans may remember the Conte boys from the New York City-based Company of Wolves - originally signed to Mercury Records.After the group split, the Contes formed Crown Jewels and released the debut album, "Spitshine," a few years back (check it out). However, their new Linoleum CD is well worth the wait!The standout track is "Last Confession," with a rockin' sound and catchy hooks. You'll dig the slow grooves of "Strawberryvelvetfiftycentshoes." And you might relate to loving the "Toughest Girl in the Neighborhood."If you think the songs sound awesome on CD, they sound even better played live. Pick up a copy of Linoleum and see the Jewels perform when they come to your town!$LABEL$1

critical distance. I've read most of the reviews here. They are little over done. But, this is a fine album. Lisa's band is tight and competent. The production and mixing of the CD are excellent. Lisa's voice, of course, is the highlight. Her voice is sublime and can send chills down my spine; vigorous, yet vulnerable. I was stuck on this album for quite a while and still enjoy listening to it from time to time. Her lyrics are one of the weaker points, though. It's not that they're bad, just not what they might be, sometimes confusing and, worst of all, sometimes trite and simplistic. Her sentiments are heartfelt, but her ability to capture them with words can still use some work. In any case, this album is well worth it. I was quite disappointed with her second album. She is a cutie, though, and that doesn't hurt.$LABEL$1
Missy is dinkie die true blue. This CD is just awesome..her lyrics are fantastic and her singing voice has a sarcastic edge to it that makes it so Aussie I can't even explain it.I can't believe all this babble about her accent being fake. She is from Melbourne, a city founded primarily by free Settlers, as opposed to Irish Convicts in Sydney and Hobart. The free settlers were often of Scottish (as well as a Irish and a few Scouses) decent which makes the Melbourne accent slightly different to Sydney, its more nasal, like a Kiwi accent is.. So for all you babbling on about how a freakin Aussies sounds (I doubt many of you seppos (Americans) know the word is pronounced Ozzie not Ussie, like Ozzie Osbourne and or how to actually pronounce Melbourne) all the Aussies are saying she is dinkie die true blue mate (and yeah thats means really Australian)..so why not listen to us.$LABEL$1

For the $$ this toy is not that fun. Our 8 yearold wanted this toy so badly for Christmas. He was willing to give up getting anything else just to have this toy.

It does a few tricks and can roam on its own. Our son read the entire manual, did all the tricks, and the poor roboraptor is in the closet collecting dust. I would not reccoment this toy to anyone b/c of the price and lack of entertainment value.$LABEL$0
Not Their Best. Don't get me wrong. I believe that dashboard confessional is one of the best bands out there. chris carrabba's music is the heart-wrenching, cry-yourself-to-sleep kind. but when I first got this cd, I was rather disappointed. The lyrics are still as emotional as always, but they don't have the same impact as there is on their other cds. chris' voice is mellow without the kick it usually has, and they have diluted their sound to mere pop. judging from past work, this cd isn't as "full" as it could be. they are capable of much more.$LABEL$1

Awful. Unlistenable. Emaciated, pale and emotionless.. I've also been a fan of Stan Rogers for at least 20 years. I had high hopes for a fresh interpretation of some of his best works. This isn't it.All the vocalists combined can't match Stan's own range. The opening bar of the Mary Ellen Carter (1st song) gave me high hopes for the rest of the CD, but I was BITTERLY disappointed.The idea of a mediocre tenor singing Northwest Passage would be laughable. But that's what they did here. They absolutely butchered his music.This entire album completely lacked the emotion and passion that Stan brought to his music. It was a cheap, hollow imitation that wouldn't have stood on it's own merits in the absence of Stan, but knowing (and loving) his music made it even worse.It was the equivalent of expecting the finest Filet Mignon and getting a cold, uncooked hot dog instead. Yecch.$LABEL$0

Treats its subject matter with psychoanalytical expertise and in-depth examination. Divine Subjection: The Rhetoric Of Sacramental Devotion In Early Modern England by Gary Kuchar (Assistant Professor of English, University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) is a blend of theoretical analysis and close readings in historical context in order to better understand the connection between devotional literature and early modern English culture. Chapters discuss the "gendering" of god in the poetry of Richard Crashaw, representation and embodiment in John Donne's "Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions", representation of the recusant soul in the works of Robert Southwell, and concepts of body, word, and self as written by Thomas Traherne. A meticulous and scholarly text for intermediate to advanced history, theology, and philosophy students, Divine Subjection treats its subject matter with psychoanalytical expertise and in-depth examination.$LABEL$1

burned out after 3 years of light use. I've bought Bon-Aire products in the past, and generally satisfied with their performance. Initially I was very happy about the Bon-Aire BA121 because it inflates tires much faster than the old Bon-Aire AC150 I previously owned(and it still runs). The problem with the BA121 is that it failed after 3 years of relatively light use. I inflate 2 sets of 4 tires 4 times a year. That comes out to 32 inflations a year. So in 3 years that would be 96 inflations. And then it died a premature death.$LABEL$0

I finally took it down and read it, and while I will agree that is was no Secret Life of Bees, I thought that it was pretty good. It is not an uncommon tale, although I am not that far from the main characters age, and I would not have conducted my life as she did, I know some women who would and who would handle the situation as she did. A quick and light read. Not so sure as to the reason for all the outrage. It's just fiction, people.$LABEL$1

A very scholarly history that is also a very good read. I bought this book in the bookstore at Versailles. After my tours of the palace and the gardens looking for ghosts and wondering what life was like and what was in the heads of the people at courts of Louis XIV, XV and XVI. I was hoping that this history would help me with that and it did. This is a well footnoted scholarly history but it is also a very good read, a very unusually good read.$LABEL$1
Keep looking....... This book was a slap in the face to all VB programmers. They preach "their" coding techniques to you, then they don't follow it themselves. By the way, they other reviews about this book being full of bugs, is correct!$LABEL$0
You, guys, need to chill!. Why is everyone attacking Bill? Well... Because he writes a book, about his view on USA as it is and as he sees it today. I've never heard Bill calling people, F****** As****** on TV. Of course, my oppinion may be bias, since I agree with 95% of his comments. And haven't even completed the book, but so far its logical and if you have some common sence, even if you don't agree with Bill, you can see where he is coming from and if you have an open mind you can certainly learn a thing or two. Mr. O'Reilly is a true independent, and that what drives everyone nuts.$LABEL$1
Love This Book!. I love picking up this book, just to look at all the stitches. This book is full of them, and each one has a description underneath, showing you how to do them. You also get sections on knitting and crocheting. The sections have illustrated pictures, descriptions on how to do both, and other various information to help you get started on both. Overall, I really love how detailed this book is, love having so many stitches that range in difficulty, and love that this book is all inclusive. Great book to have for anyone.$LABEL$1
Wonderful pieces not just for the horn enthusiast. I owned this on LP and was bowled over by the playing. Now to have it on CD is fabulous-I think I wore out the record. Everything here is a pleasure: the music, playing, and recording. NOT background music but great beauty and virtuosic playing by Tuckwell that keeps your attention riveted.$LABEL$1

HORRIBLE!!. The only thing that this movie and the book have in common is the name Jason Bourne. It does not follow the chronological order of the book. The name Carlos the Jackal is NOT even mentioned. They do not mention that Marie is a PHD, and she willingly joins him. He tells her everything from the get go. In the book he kidnaps her and does not come clean until near the end. The closing scene in the book at the safe house is not even in the movie. Based on this movie they have no intention of doing the next two books. It is almost impossible. This movie is as far away from the book as it can get.$LABEL$0

Offensive Spanish swear words in track titles. Maybe some kind of factory fluke on my CD, a practical joke by a disgruntled employee, but the 13 track titles on my CD did not correspond to the printed labels on the cherubic paper cover. Instead they were unprintable vulgarities in Spanish. Moreover, the unidentified guitarist plays out of tune.$LABEL$0
Wish I had not bought this. I bought the DI-624 and a DWL-G520. Bad, bad, bad, very bad.The problem is the g520. I cannot get any decent signal strength. I even added a 6db microstrip antenna and it made no difference at all. More money wasted. All I can get under any circumstance is very low signal strength. It works somewhat until it drops the signal entirely. How useless it that!!??This card is junk!! But at least it doesn't freeze my computer.$LABEL$0
An engaging, literate, accurately detailed novel.. Tariq Ali's rich and complex historical novel is set against the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. An ancient stone sculpted shaped in the form of a woman overlooks the palace where generations of Pasha family members and servants have abided for generations. The Stone Woman is an engaging, literate, accurately detailed, highly recommended novel of personalities and events as the family becomes scattered across Europe, in a time of political unrest and the clash of major power politics under the likes of Bismarck, Disraeli, and the Russian Tsar. Also highly recommended reading are the Tariq Ali's first two novels in his planned "Islamic Quartet", Shadows Of The Pomegranate and The Book Of Saladin.$LABEL$1

One of the best films of the '70s--no kidding.. I can't tell you what an original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, nothing else like it in the world and completely successful in its dogged pursuit of capturing something intensely disturbing (and yet completely satisfying and jubilant--go figure). The deeply weird all-male family is quintessential Americana dementia--the goony birthmarked hitchhiker, bulky Leatherface in his black tie, the frustrated father ("Look what your brother did to the door!"), and of course, the blood-hungry nearly dead Grandpa. Will you think I'm mentally balanced if I say that they evoke pity and sympathy as well as horror? They do! There is something undeniably bittersweet about them. The thwarted Leatherface swinging his chainsaw impotently through the air at sunrise on the highway at the end of the movie is one of the classic images of cinema. You must brave this movie. Any reluctance on your part will be redeemed.$LABEL$1

Love Love Love these knives. I've had these knives for over a year and I still love them. They are easy to use and are very sharp and effective.

This album is not worth the money.. The problem with this CD is that it wreaks of ego, and yet no substance.The voice is the same as any other I've ever heard, but has been produced by a fellow Canadian, and a label that needs to make it's money back by placing it on soundtracks, desperate to get their investment back.The songs of boring, boring, boring.$LABEL$0
A fun romp of a book.... This is one of those books you gulp down fast, like a cold beer after cutting the grass! A lite beer, frothy and not too filling, but definitely hits the spot on a hot afternoon. I'm a sucker for first person narrative, and the heroine is spunky and fresh. The last half of the book gallops by a little too fast after the great buildup, but I had a good time reading it and will be looking for more by this author.$LABEL$1
A wonderful story. Another wonderful book by Lynn Kurland. This book is even more wonderful if you have read "This is all I ask". You get to know Kenderick before the events that make "Stardust of Yesterday". But is still great all by itself.$LABEL$1
Misleading and Not Helpful. I recommend against buying this book. I read only about a third of it and found two errors on fundamental points. On p. 67, there is a glaring misstatement about the use of Wizards that suggests that the authors never even tried the feature they are "explaining." And on page 98 there is a section on "Nudging" shapes where in half a page of text the authors do not reveal the one thing that one must do in order to "nudge" a shape -- namely, hold down the Shift key while using the up and down arrow keys. It appears that nobody bothered to proofread this book after it was written.$LABEL$0
Wicked. Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (Harper Fiction)I did not like the book at all. I made myself read it.$LABEL$0
Human Disorder - Ugly Modern Aggression. Human Disorder should stand high in anyone's rankings of underground metal bands. This was one of the first "Hardcore" or "Hard Rock" CD's I ever bought because I was so impressed with the bands live performance, and their lyrical content. I continue to listen to this CD four or five years after I bought it, and I enjoy it each time.When I first met the band and saw them perform, they quickly sold out of the CD's they had in stock, and it took awhile to track down a store that would order it for me. Now, thanks to internet stores like Amazon, everyone can enjoy some of the best underground music without the hassle of tracking down a retailer.If you're into "hardcore," "metal," or "hard rock," check this out, you won't be dissappointed.$LABEL$1
i miss this show. I was determined to own the entire series of this show from the minute I started watching it. I only started being a loyal viewer in the 5th season, and got hooked. As soon as I have the entire set, (which is soon) I plan on having myself a marathon and seeing the George Clooney beginning to the end of what I thought was one of the best shows on TV.$LABEL$1

Thanks for Ruining The "Batman" Series! I Appreciate it!. What can I say. This movie is HORRIBLE. It completley loses the darkness, the danger, and the creepiness that were found in the first two movies. Val Kilmer just wasn't a good enough Batman. Gotham is now a disco inferno other than a dark and pest-infested city where true evil lurks. This failed attempt to build on to the series is a joke. Plain and simple.However, I DID like Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones. They were great, but that still didn't help the movie any.Thought this series couldn't get any worse after this one was made, until...............$LABEL$0
Too easy to claim a "Black Belt" title. I was looking for a challenging book and the booked looked promising as the book cover rated the "super tough" and the back says it will test even the best, most proficient experts" NOT!!!I would give the puzzles a "moderate" rating and the difficulty does not increase toward the end of the book which was disappointing. I did improve my solving speed and honed my pattern recognition skills but did not encounter or require any of the more advanced solving techniques.$LABEL$0

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER !. My complaint isn't with the show itself. It's with Warner Home Video. I purchased this DVD from Amazon. It arrived shortly thereafter. However, when I opened it, it had two disc ones, and NO disc two. I called the customer service number on the box and explained the situation. They were very polite and said they were a "fulfillment" company but would forward the problem to Warner Home Video.To make a long story short, I have called a total of five times since early December, and been totally ignored. ALL I WANT IS THE RIGHT DISC. Perhaps Warner Home Video is so big it can ignore customers with impunity, but as a lifelong Superman geek, I'm terribly disappointed.WARNER HOME VIDEO, DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS?$LABEL$0
Another bold ripoff of TECH Method. Without a single acknowledgement of TECH Method Tomczyk boldly goes where others have gone before.What should you write about a book basically plagiarizing other's works? The sections on superheat, subcooling, are obviously lifted from TECH Method. Subcooling and superheat at the compressor was never discussed in this industry until Lloyd wrote TECH Method and the people who don't give him credit are reprehensible.The other parts of the book aren't noteworthy as the information is available elsewhere. The five part Copeland manuals come to mind flipping through this book.Not a troubleshooting book as much as an instruction book. Troubleshooting is is all ways better in TECH Method where it's broken down by system. And gives specifics as to settings for each system.While this is better than no book. I suggest something other than this book.TECH Method:[...]$LABEL$0
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!. I have never written a review before, but I just could not let such a defective product go unnoticed. I have been a loyal Palm customer for years now and decided to buy this one for my wife due to it's size and it having all the features she needs. After receiving not one, but two that were defective straight out of the box, I will be ordering a Tungsten E for her.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Palm has obviously not spent any money on quality control and does not care if they destroy their reputation by putting a shoddy product on the market. Even with the attractive price, this product is simply not worth the problems - it is not a value if it doesn't work!$LABEL$0

Great Fox gloves. I've used the gloves on 15 rides now and they don't show any signs of wear. I ride hard, usually 25-35 miles a ride, rain or shine. Medium fits me like they are my own skin; not too much fabric over the wrist. The Velcro strap allows me to cinch up the wrist as tight or as loose as I want. Fast drying and I definitely like the softer fabric on the thumb for wiping my face.And a bargain price.$LABEL$1

The Brutality and Horror of War. This book offers us a glimpse of the brutality of the Air War over Europe from the American perspective. Numerous photos of doomed aircraft with wings sheared off, gas tanks exploding, gaping holes caused by flak that are both spectacular and horrific. One cannot help but to wonder what these men were thinking in their last moments. Overall this is a good book; I think, though, that there aren't enough pictures (some I've seen quite often) to justify the cost, and the text was somewhat sparse and did not offer much in the way of background information.$LABEL$1
RUDE & AGGRESSIVE. The number of times "Shut Up" appears in these stories is shocking!! We have never seen the series but we have a cute Scholastic Thomas book and when our son received a Thomas Train Set I picked up a couple more books from the library. My husband and I were VERY disapointed with the language and the aggressive nature of all the characters (trains & people). Trains hitting each other and saying "there's more coming should you misbehave." Threatening to send trains away for being "clumsy." Of course our son loves the books because he loves trains but we don't want him learning anything these books have to teach.$LABEL$0
Laughter for young and old. My dad introduced me to Pogo, and at first I found it hard to read. The phonetics and gramatical "modifications" that Kelly used to get across the Southern accents of the characters were strange to a five year old yankee. Later I realized Kelly isn't lampooning Southern accents, he's actually paying homage to them in a humorous way.This recording has two levels also. You can listen to it as a collection of nonsensical lyrics set to some nicely composed musical backdrops, or you can appreciate all the archaic words and double meanings in the songs. The more familiar you are with old literature, the more likely you are to know words like "quoits" and "swain" and "twixt".Young listeners will love this recording for the happy driving melodies with the funny words. Older ones will appreciate the double meanings and clever use of archaic language on top of the inherently ridiculous lyrics.$LABEL$1
Cute story. After living a very sheltered life Lesley Caldwell could not believe when the fine gentlemen Quincy stops and talks to her. She could not control her blushes and giggles. Her only source of relationships with men are from her romance novels.Quincy could have any woman that he wants and knows that there are many who want him also. What he can't believe is that he is so attracted to Lesley because she is not like some of the women he has dated in the past.There relationship grows but not without some drama. There fellow co-worker Cheryl is a trip. Some of the things she does and says are just unbelievable.This is an easy one day read. I was shocked that Cheryl wrote such a short book compared to her previous releases. You will love this book there is laughter, sadness and the most important issue suspense.$LABEL$1
tough tough read. I didn't make it to the end of this book - I really didn't see the point. I suppose if you believe the United States miitary is the center of evil in the world and they are resposnible for defiling the environment this might be your kind of book.Like most people, I thought the book's premise reasoble, but the author never really pulls it off. There are all sorts of things that are being set up and go absolutely no where.Finally, I did not understand the motivations for a number of the second tier characters.$LABEL$0
Great Book. As all the other reviews, note this book is not much of a departure from Parker's Spenser series. That said, it is a fun read. Sunny is a fun new character. It is clear Sunny could easily be a Helen Hunt.The story is much like earlier Spenser books we have all loved-whether that is a good or bad thing. Parker has included the good and the bad from his earlier efforts. We see the effortless way he puts characters together with only a few words. And the way the characters interact-much like Spenser with Hawk and Susan. Sunny has her sidekick friends Spike and the lover with who she has the issues involved in all long running relationships. Nothing new here. Parker also uses his broad brush of few words with the usual character stereotypes the reader will recognize from the Spenser books.All these things aside, we are glad to get a new Robert B. Parker book. He still has what it takes.$LABEL$1
Only One Lesson learned.... Never buy a movie without seeing it first. I bought this movie after seing the trailers and constant requests from my daughter. I finally gave up. Silly me... I wasted my money. The movie introduces you into this wonderful world, raising your expectations, and then they drop this stupid plot, with absolutely no purpose. I had to spend more than an hour after we saw it, trying to calm down my very upset daughter, who was crying almost hysterically, yelling: "why Mom, why????" But, lesson learned.$LABEL$0
Looks Great, But Where's the Audio Out?!. I thought this was superior to the Archos 20Gb, with better interface and FM tuner, only to be shocked to observe that the only output is via USB? Who the heck uses these things on a computer once music is loaded? Where's the output to enable an RCA jack to a stereo system so you can do away with the CD changer? I returned mine same day and bought the Archos.$LABEL$0

Lousy.. I was not satisfied with this movie. I did not expect it to be similar to the first version of The Butterfly Effect. However, what I did expect was that the film would at least do a decent job of telling the story in an effective manner similar to the first. It failed, however. The acting was lousy. The script was poor. The movie was an embarrassment and should have had substantial revisions. Unfortunate.$LABEL$0
Customer Service is terrible at Panasonic and the product is unreliable!!!. Had to change the drum about after 2 years of moderate use. I changed the drum (almost $100) in October 2006 due to streaking. Late February 2007, only after 4 months of use, it started streaking again! Contacted the CS at Panasonic and it was a complete waste of time; left message with the supervisor, never returned my calls. The Panasonic customer service policy is frustrate you and hope you will go away! Well, I won't go away. The freaking defective drum costs more than half of the machine!I will write to someone higher up and let the person know just exactly how I was treated by their CS. I own lots of audio, video equipment and do you think I would consider Panasonic product in the future, not a chance! Do you think I would buy any Panasonic product in the future, not a chance! This is very short-sighted approach from Panasonic in a very competive environment.$LABEL$0

It kept me turning the pages, but...... Let me say first that I like Sandra Brown. But I sure wish her characters could be a little deeper and not so dense. They do the dumbest things! It's kind of like in the horror films when no right-minded young female would enter a dark menacing building at midnight...but they still do, you know? Everyone in the theater wants to yell, "DON'T GO IN THERE!!!" But the idiot on screen still does and all kinds of bad things happen. Overall, The Alibi was a pretty good plot with enough twists to keep my interest. The outcome of Sandra Brown's books is always a given: good wins out. Buy, hey, that's why I read them! I LIKE it when good wins! You won't be disappointed.$LABEL$1

When the wayans, J.LO, Kelly Koffied left then so did all the talent. When shows do final seasons usually they go out with a bang. But saddly this shows last bullets in this shows gun was a bunch of blanks. Now dont get me wrong, it was funny, I'll give it that, that's the only reason it got 2 stars, but season 1-4 raised the comedy standeard so high and were so funny but this season was a huge failure IN LIVING COLOR wise. So I'd recomend this for the series collectors like me. meaning I have season 1-4 and although I didnt like season 5, I'd feel uncomplete without it.$LABEL$0
Classicly lovely and great for baby's vision. Not only is this a simple, timeless, unisex looking mobile, but it is also great for the development of a baby's vision. Whereas some mobiles function moreso to match decor, other mobiles are educational attachments to the crib. Keep in mind that pastel colors are not appreciated by infants for months. The panda bear was the first animal seen by my infant b/c of the black and white. The primary colors of Blue Jean Teddy then become noticed. The green gingham pattern on the dog and the softer hued duck were spotted after further development. My baby is now a sitter and she still likes to look at the panda the most. The only con of this mobile is the wind-up music box. I would have preferred a battery-operated one so that it can play as long as I and my baby wanted. But the reasonable price of this mobile AS WELL as the cute look of it made it a great buy. Educational baby products don't have to look weird!$LABEL$1
Some problems but great grinding action. Great grinding action, quiet, and fast. Downfalls are hard to clean, and we have had a problem with the switch.

Nothing in the literature says to do this, but it is the only way ours will work. Would not buy another.$LABEL$0

False Advertising. I couldn't find a case that was meant for my camera, so I looked around and found this one. According to the measurements on Amazon it's "8.3 x 5.5 x 3.3 inches". That would have been plenty of room for my camera and a few accessories as well, so I bought it and it arrived today. At first I thought they must have sent me the wrong one. Nope, it's the correct case. The problem is that it only measures 5 1/4 x 4 3/4 x 3 inches and my camera won't fit into it.$LABEL$0
No Right Channel. I have the exact same problem as the other reviewer who tagged this item as "poor" - and with so many good reviews I wonder if there is a problem with this manufacturing run.

Too bad because I had high hopes for this product, but now it's got to be returned.$LABEL$0

Unfortunately based on incorrect information. This book, as well as the many tales of the ENIAC, are factually incorrect. This was even proven by a federal judge in the state of Minnesota.On October 19, 1973, US Federal Judge Earl R. Larson signed his decision following a lengthy court trial which declared the ENIAC patent of Mauchly and Eckert invalid and named Atanasoff the inventor of the electronic digital computer -- the Atanasoff-Berry Computer or the ABC.Mr. McCartney does a great job of ignoring the facts that were proven in the case,and instead believes the hearsay, and tarnished depositions that were later recanted.$LABEL$0

They missed the point. In the true Fifties Hollywood spirit, this film seems to miss the point of the original book entirely. The strongest theme throughout the book was how lust for power can corrupt anyone - even the closest of your friends.However, the Hollywood dream weavers wanted to play it easy for the audience, and turned it into an inane sanctimonial hallelujah - and poorly even as that. The acting is stiff, the dialogue just plain corny, and the storytelling bland.The bookwriter Mika Waltari's popularly acknowledged masterpiece deserves a much better film than this.$LABEL$0
As expected. Korn did it again. Same riff's, same sound, same lyrics, same style! Please Korn renew!! The first 2 albums were great, then it was time for a renewel because many bands stole the 'Korn Sound'. Korn didn't renew themself which means that they are musically dead. A pitty.$LABEL$0
Story line missed the mark. Not good. I and II were very good and married into to each other very well. This was a B rated movie at best and they are trying to bring in low cost actors to continue to the run. Do not watch. And please do not let there be a IV.$LABEL$0
Junk. I have had the same experience as many of the other reviewers on this forum, pixelation and freeze-up. I have had mine for less than one year and it has now failed for the third time. Panasonic is absolutely no help and will not recognize that they have a faulty product. I will never purchase any of their products based on the service I have received$LABEL$0
hard to describe because it's so good. This books prompts one to trot out superlatives such as marvellous, sweeping, epic, but at the same time, the focus on each character's lives is highly personal. They are so many story lines, each a book until itself, yet Ms. Davis has managed to weave them into a tapestry that is hypnotic.It's a book at is working on so many levels. A great book that deserves recognition.$LABEL$1

Not for Breast Milk or Glass Bottles. So we thought the features like the cooling and heating would be great, nowhere did it say it would not work with glass bottles until we opened it. Then for Breast Milk you basically have to heat it twice so the 5 min turns into 20 min (5 plus 10 for cool down plus another 5) This was a great disappointment and I am happily packing it up for return.$LABEL$0
Not the best Step Workout. This instructor goes right into the steps without much instruction. I can see how this workout could be fun once you know the steps but trying to learn them without guidance is very frustrating. The other frustrating part is the camera work. There are too many close up views of the instructors face. You are not able to see what steps they are doing when the camera is in on a close up. I would not buy this DVD again or recommend it to anyone.$LABEL$0
Not worth the trouble.. I bought this hearing it was bad. Being a DBZ fan and having seen all the movies up to this one I thought hey how bad could it be. Well it made me regret the money I spent on it. If you must see it rent it or borrow it from someone they might just give it to you. Anyway the only reason I think someone should buy this is if they want to own all the DBZ movies or if you bought Triple Threat with all 3. The first 2 are a Godsend compared to this.$LABEL$0

"In Time" is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen!. "In Time" is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen! Save yourself the t-he "TIME" and never watch this terribly written story!Oh and if for whatever reason you decide not to heed my warning, and a 1/4 of the way through the movie when you realize it's the stupidest and most ridiculous POS ever, but you wanna keep watching because maybe they'll start to possibly explain the movie or perhaps give you some background on this pathetic time technology... DON'T!!! This movie explains nothing. These people walk around with literally, their life savings on their arms! Which!! anyone can just grab and take at will. AHHHHH!!!!! are you kidding! The writer couldn't even come up with a sensible way to end the movie, just a 2 man army, about to rob the worlds biggest bank. What the....! I want my "TIME" back!!!$LABEL$0

Great book for expanding your financial knowledge.. I am on my second read of your book and have been so glad that I came across it through an Amazon search. Based on your ability to put this subject in terms that a layman can understand and the comments from your other readers, I felt comfortable enough that I have made my first trades using your system. I bought stocks in May that met the criteria and then sold the options for them. By doing the math, I can see that making 25% - 36% per year will be no problem. I feel the excitement that Jake felt in the book and I can't wait till June for my first option to be up so I can make my next trade. Thank you, thank you, thank you for writing your book.$LABEL$1
The Psychology of Action. I have found this book to be a great reference for goal theory. Having been published in 1996, it provides another source for following the evolution of goal theory, after such books as Maehr and Braskamp's, "The Motivation Factor", and Locke and Latham's, "A Theory of Goal Setting & Task Performance". The contributing authors read like a who's who of contemporary goal setting and achievement research. It has been very helpful in my research, it collects into one book current information that I spent considerable time finding one article at a time from several journals. I'm in Sport Psychology and I have concluded it is a must have.$LABEL$1
Table of Contents Would be Nice. I haven't read the book, so this is actually a review of the info on the book. Why is there no TOC listed? How am I to decide on this book if I don't know what plays it contains. Very bad marketing.$LABEL$0

Rodney Respectfully Croons Some Tunes. Rodney Dangerfield has sung songs in some of his movies, most notably the animated "Rover Dangerfield" and "The 4th Tenor." Except for the last bonus track, all of the songs on this album were recorded from 2000 to 2004, when Rodney was old and in failing health. His version of "Strangers In The Night" does not compare favorably to Frank Sinatra's version, while the remix version of that tune is even worse. Rodney's song selection is somewhat strange, covering the religious hymns "I Believe" and "He." He's more enjoyable to listen to when he's singing the upbeat "I Spent My Birthday In Las Vegas" and "Rappin' Rodney," the title song taken from his 1983 comedy album. Rodney's even more enjoyable to listen to when he's telling jokes!$LABEL$0
Review. Very nice book, but it took a little while to get into it. Peltz' style of writting could flow a little better but when one reads books written by anthorpologists you know what you are getting into.$LABEL$0
Awesome movie but not exactly as I remember it.. When I first saw this movie I interpreted it to be a straight up action/adventure movie. Not seeing the movie in over 20 years this interpretation is how I remembered it. I watched the movie recently and it was completely different from my memory. Not a bad film but I completely forgot about the comedy aspect of it and how it wasn't really a serious action/adventure piece in the style of the Die Hard series.$LABEL$1
why skull cany why????. i have bin using these headphones for like over a year now and everyone has the same problem with them like after the 3rd month one of the speakers on the headphone start to act up if skull candy does not fix this issue soon then they might lose alot of sales due to the bad reports that people will eventually put up online about these products....im now thinking about buying the studio edition of the skull candy headphones but if i see 1 thing talking about 1 of the speakers going bad im not buying it and if i should count ive bin through 6 of the regular ones so far$LABEL$0

Truly a moving movie experience. I've never been a big Metallica fan... heavy metal just isn't on the top of my music list, so I was marginally interested in seeing this movie. But, I often find documentaries fascinating, so I watched it.I have to confess... I was extremely moved and captivated by what I saw. Actually, I couldnt's stop watching it. It was genuinely inspiring to see these hard-core metal icons being courageous enough to face their demons and show up real, exposing their humanity to the world ~ rather than being content to hide behind their fame.Oddly enough, this movie gave me a sense of hope ~ hey, if these spoiled, ego-centric "rock stars" can evolve and learn from their own human experience how to make peace with each other... maybe there's hope for us as a nation? My personal thanks to Metallica for having what it takes to tell the truth.$LABEL$1
Poor Content. The information provided in this DVD series is very limited and in some cases wrong! What is provided is very basic. Anyone who has taken astronemy classes or watched another similar TV series (such as Carl Sagan's) will learn nothing new. Very broad and inacurate assumptions are made without sufficient effort to gratify them (for example a black hole may devourer our solar system). Little factual information is presented to provide a clear picture.I did not find the series entertaining, even with the decent CGI effects. I do not recommend this for anyone with a fair knowledge of astronemy.$LABEL$0

MGM hits a new low in Tastelessness. Whoever thought up this abomination must have been out of his mind.Technically,they did a good job,sets,props,camera work,etc.A fine set of supporting actors provide characterizations that are cliches,at best.The plot doesn't even qualify as stereotypic;the dialogue is inane;and the leads don't even provide roles that manage to be one-dimensional.There is a continuous emphasis on brutal cruel,and grossly inhumane situations,terrifying horrors of the ancient world,monstrous disregard for life,and appalling barbarisms.3/5 of the way through the picture is the most atrocious sequence;a ritual human sacrifice which will outrage anyone with the moral fastidiousnessof a gila monster. .... This piece of tripe deserves any bad remarks a critic can find.$LABEL$0

Overpriced, overdesigned. I love tools and that together with the look and feel of these and the fact that I spent so much should have guaranteed a positive review. Unfortunately, in actual use these are a pain. They are difficult to use one-handed. When adjusting you need to release with one hand while holding square to slide the other. When pumping them closed they don't really get that tight so you'll end out switching to the screw adjustment. I might forgive that but you also have to be careful to leave sufficient thread to release since unscrewing is the only release mechanism.So, save your $$ and get the Bessey tradesman clamps. Just slip it into position while putting it on, and twist it tight. You can get several Tradesmen for the price of one Powergrip.$LABEL$0

Excellent first read from Cheryl Kaye Tardif. I picked this book up on a whim, and could not put it down.Ms. Kaye-Tardif has a wonderfully unique writing style that I enjoyed very much, and I am looking forward to reading more novels by her.Whale Song is the story of Sarah Richardson, who at age 11, moves to Canada from Wyoming in the summer of 1977. She is befriended by a Native American girl and her Grandmother, and they take Sarah into their family and treat her as their own.Sarah's father, Jack, worked for a company studying marine biology and Sarah often went out on the Ocean with him listening to the sounds of Killer Whales, and seeing whales close up.I love this book so much, but know that I can't say much else about it without giving away main events in the novel. If you're looking for an easy, thought provoking read, I suggest you pick up Whale Song.$LABEL$1
Worst "concert" video ever!!!. This supposed concert video is nothing but a collection of nonsense pre-concert, backstage, and audience garbage video. It shows 2 second clips of actual "live" band footage intermixxed with camera shots bouncing all over the place. A real concert video is just that, a live video of a band on stage playing their songs. Thank GOD I bought a cheap VHS version. I never even watched the whole thing. If you want to see a real show check out Iron Maiden's Rock In Rio or Primal Fear's The History Of Fear. This crap wouldn't be worth watching if it was sent to you for free!!!! I can't imagine Ozzy ever saw this and approved its release.$LABEL$0

Problems with modern mice. I have this device and a 2-port Linksys. Frequently with this one, I get a delay in or totally lose my mouse control when switching between computers.

Read the book instead. I just finished reading the book for the second time last week, and I just got done watching the dvd tonight. I've read everything by Stephen King and I think this book may be the best. The movie is not bad; Anthony Hopkins is well cast and does fine here, but the movie is like a reader's digest condensed version of a masterpiece that should not be touched. I know - you say that the book is always better than the movie. But this time the heart of the novel was removed. The characters were so much more developed, the story more supernatural. The book is a masterpiece that captures the spirit of the 60's, the magic of childhood, and the inevitable loss of everything. Skip the movie and spend an enjoyable week reading.$LABEL$0
Comparison of new vs old release. The sole purpose of this review is to compare "The Invisible Man" in this collection to the older DVD release.EXCELLENT. Dramatic improvement - much better contrast and detail. It appears that a different source print was used, and it's much better than that which was used for the older DVD. This is unquestionably worth the upgrade, regardless of all the added benefits.You can view screen capture comparisons on my website.$LABEL$1
Love this movie!. When I saw this The Avengers on Amazon I noticed the Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo set was the same price as the Blu-ray/DVD combo set, so I of course bought the four-disc combo set even though I don't have a blu-ray 3D player. The blu-ray is great quality and the extra features are top quality.$LABEL$1
Hard on the ears. The first half of this CD is hard to listen to. Although music is a matter of personal taste, I find this music to be extremely irritating and grinding on the ears. It is played in a high scale on piano (electric or synthesized?) and I find myself passing over 1st half of CD missing the subliminal opportunity. Second half is fine. Subsequently, effectiveness can't be fairly assessed.$LABEL$0
full catastrophe living. Although I have not yet finished the book, I can tell already that this is the best self-help book I have read. There is no difficult jargon, but still you feel taken seriously. The pace is quiet, everything is very well explained, and I really think this therapy works. That is, if you yourself are prepared to invest, because the author certainly demands a commitment. Although the term `mindfulness' is often misused by so-called therapists, this is the real thing. Do you feel stuck in a rut of negative thought, or are lived day-in, day-out by your pain, try this book. I am convinced it will help you too.$LABEL$1
Enjoyable & informative. I found this book not only very informative & funny. The only reason I didn't give the 5th star is that it was written before the exam was released & the practice questions, while helpful to reinforce fundamentals, did not match what the exam authors came up with. In the real world, I'd trust Gary & Bob far more than the exam authors with security of a network. For sitting in a little room facing tough questions, add a good practice exam to run the score up. This book helped me pass on the first try.$LABEL$1
Won't Load. I have all the requirements, but it still won't load onto my PC or laptop. I haven't had a chance to see how bad it is. I should have read the reviews before I put it on my Christmas wish list.$LABEL$0
Disappointed. A friend of mine loaned this book to me, raving about the story. The packaging on the book is well done and makes it appear as if it's much bigger than it truly is. Upon reading though, I found the book to lack the depth that I presumed was there. The characters are very flat, the writing is juvenile at times, but the plot kept me going.There is so much potential in the story here, but I don't feel the writers have taken the time with their work to polish it and add depth to their work. It looks as if they're kicking two of these books out per year, which leads me to believe they're more interested in churning them out rather than creating a quality piece of fiction.Still, I keep reading them. The plot is just enough to keep me moving forward. I do see the agenda in these books, and as a Catholic, I feel somewhat offended by this. I feel like they've done a lot of stereotyping in the series.$LABEL$0
Good, but no Rusted Angel. Expanding senses is overall a well-rounded album and deserves recognition for being so but... doesn't quite live up to it's other albums.Here it shows Darkane changing more towards melodic death than its thrashier roots.Also they got rid of Lawrence Mackrory, his replacement (Andreas Sydow) is good,but not up to par.Thankfully Peter Wildoer(ex-Arch Enemy) is still pounding the skins like usual, maybe not as good in rusted angel but hey, he's an awesome drummer anyways.Definetely worth the money, but if you're new to Darkane, check out Rusted Angel before getting Expanding Senses.$LABEL$1

Another Hit From Strunz and Farah!. This is another great Strunz and Farah album, but it is hard to beat their previous works Americas and Heat of the Sun. However any way you slice it it is still world class Flamenco and Latin guitar music. If you are new to Strunz and Farah get Americas and/or Heat of the Sun. They are awesome! If you already own those titles and are looking for more excellent Spanish guitar music then pick up this title, Zona Torrida, Wild Muse, and Stringweave. That will give you a strong and amazing collection of music from this genre. Enjoy!$LABEL$1
Good Holster, Great Price. BLACKHAWK! is a well known brand used by security companies, police, and military forces around the world for a reason. These holsters are good, made of a lightweight polymer, and function like they say they do. The company isn't known for putting out poor products.Mine is for a left hander on a Springfield 1911 A1 Loaded model. So I was skeptical when it said fits 1911 Government Model and Clones, considering variations can screw things up. This holster lives up to what it promised, and I love it. The best feature is that the release for your weapon relies on the finger, and by design, will place your finger on the frame and out of the trigger guard, ensuring you won't shoot yourself or discharge when you aren't ready. It helps to remove error, teaches the shooter the proper draw, and works extremely well at doing it's job: carrying your firearm. I highly recommend this holster to anyone who plans to carry their weapon.$LABEL$1
Read Concrete Blonde first. Unlike most authors with continuing characters, Connelly has not published the Bosch stories in chronological order. Black Echo is an entertaining novel but it reveals key plot elements of The Dollmaker case, described in the Concrete Blonde. I didn't find the plot as compelling in The Black Echo as in his later books, but perhaps that's because of my lack of interest in war experiences. The writing is unusually descriptive -- I was starting to cough with all Bosch's smoking. (Surprising he wasn't the character needing a heart transplant, described in my favorite of Connelly's books (so far), Blood Work).$LABEL$1
SPT Su 4010 Ultrasonic Dual Mist Humidifier. Received the above humidifier and used it the first night. It worked fine. The very next day the heater setting for warm mist would not work. This is a record for a usage for a new product. It lasted only one day.I am returning it to Amazon for a full refund. When packing up this return I saw a packing list on the box. It had already been returned to the company and they reshipped a defective product to me as brand new. Bad practice!!Forget buying from SPT$LABEL$0

Better strap it on first.... I keep slipping off this pillow. It's hard, makes me sweat, and it really serves no purpose when I wake up in the night and find my head down on the lower part of it.I cannot imagine one of the cheaper pillows being any less comfortable. This is a lot of money to pay for something that cannot be returned if you're not satisfied.$LABEL$0
Thanks for getting my son's hopes up!. My kindergartner was so excited when we saw this backpack online and we couldn't wait for it's arrival. Visually, it's stunning - I was contemplating using it myself if he decided not to keep it! However, on DAY 1 when I picked him up from school, BOTH of the zippers had broken (the clasp thingy had fallen off) rendering it useless and now I have to return it. My son was really upset, as was I...and I also wish I had the reviews on here before I bought it since apparently this has happened more than once before! Beware this backpack, fellow superman fans - it brings heartbreak!$LABEL$0
Awful! No more please. Please no more tween/teenage actress releasing CD. Lindsay's becoming the next Britney Spears, and that's even insulting to Brit!

NEVER AGAIN!. These diapers are awful and we'll never get them again. They seemed thinner than the Huggies we normally buy, so I guess the only plus is that you can fit more in the diaper bag/in the basket on the changing table, but the positives end there. They leak like crazy - esp. when they get pretty full during naps/bedtime - we have to wake up our son to change him in the middle of the night so he doesn't wake up in wet pajamas and a puddle in the morning. Also when they fill, they sag so terribly. Our toddler quickly learned he could easily reach in when they were saggy and mess with his poop if he had any. He also easily took them off, unlike the Huggies - probably because they were sagging and uncomfortable. Unfortunately we have 222 to get through... ugh...$LABEL$0

Sounds like the tip issue is common. I've been using mine (included with my Garmin - I know I wouldn't have paid $200 for it) for a little over a year. Recently I went to plug it in and noticed the tip missing. My concern was whether it was lodged in the cigarette lighter. Fortunately, it wasn't. I was about to throw the whole thing out, but went looking for a replacement fuse setup just in case. For a replacement cost of $200 for the unit, I'll keep looking for the part. Didn't even miss the traffic updates though - where I drive, it never did much.$LABEL$0
Benefit of Whibal smallest size. I found this item of little use for my needs. The problem really is that it takes one photo with the whibal before anything else. This adds one unit for any other number of photos. It's OK if you take quite a number of pictures in the same environment,but it's a waste if you're going to take only a few. What you get is one photo with whibal for three or so taken. However, I find that with my Canon EOS 30D, I would gain a lot more with the larger size (3.5 x 6) which would allow me to use the custon white balance. This is why I ordered a second card, this time, the right size. Unfortunately, I had to pay much more to grt what I needed.$LABEL$0
One of his best - backup band is incredible. John Hiatt with the North Mississippi Allstars as the backup....yup, it's as good as it sounds. Great album, very "Hiatt". Similar to Walk On, with a bit more of a 'produced' feel to it. That's what makes this great though, it's definitive Hiatt with just a twist of newness to make it a fresh album.I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that the storytelling isn't as good as in previous albums. They are more abstract than what I'm used to hearing, but that allows me fit in my own interperetation of the songs, which I love. Best album I've bought in '05...$LABEL$1
worst technical service encountered. I'm no computer expert but I can get by most stuff on my own. With Linksys, I had problem setting it up and I thought I can call them for advice. The technical support was a sham. The guy didn't want to stay on the phone for more than 5 minutes because he had to manage his resources for other users! My call to him was placed at 7 AM eastern standard time and he even admitted that no one was in the queue..but he just didn't want to stay on the phone. Even with any changes he suggested I had to reboot the computer at least once to accept the changes, which takes around 5 minutes and he refused to wait to see if my router was working for my computer. Perhaps Linksys is a good product, but I will never know because I am going to return it to voice my displeasure with their technical support.$LABEL$0
Saturday Morning Nostalgia. Despite the overt overacting (especially from Marshall and Will), which is sometimes necessary to engage a child audience, this classic Saturday morning series is engaging for young and old - most notably for some of the classic science fiction writing. A special treat was finding out one of the episodes (The Stranger) is penned by Star Trek alum Walter Koenig.The transfer to DVD is passable, but there are some areas where the series definately shows its age and could use some restoration.The interview with Sid and Marty Krofft is very relaxed and low key and extremely interresting, too short for all these guys have done together.The Holly - Cha Ka interview is definately for the adult crowd. A good retrospective of the series, and "Holly" is definately not the innocent young blonde girl anymore!I was happy that my son, who is dinosaur crazy, found this as engaging as the modern, special effect laiden dinosaur tales.Overall a good series, worthy of more DVD's.$LABEL$1

This music is so familiar.This guy actually takes sounds from Delerium, Tangerine Dream, Enigma, Deep Forest and others that I recognize (David Arkenstone) and combines them as his own. I even recognize the flute solos from other cd's. This is absolutely not creative.I was tired of listening to it before it was finished. Don't waste your money on this one. Just buy the other artists he is compared to for a more creative and unique experience. And by the way, this sounds nothing like Mythos.$LABEL$0
Not very informative.. This book is appropriately titled. If you have ANY common sense you will not learn anything. There are lots of lists with no elaboration; for instance "25 common mistakes of first time supervisors". There are no comments on actions one should take to avoid them, just a list. The bulleted and list based layout causes most of the pages to be half blank. This book has only about 30 full pages of text. It takes about 25-30 minutes to read cover to cover.$LABEL$0
Disappointing. As I was reading this, I kept shaking my head. This book didn't really give me a lot of help. There really isn't much in here that I couldn't find in a lot of other, much better, books. I found the advice to be plain wrong in some cases, ill-advised in others. And the author's attitude bothered me. It was off-putting.It wasn't a really horrible book, which is why it got two stars, but I've read books that gave me a lot more help. If you're insistent on buying this book, though, my copy will be up for sale. :)$LABEL$0
Great value. This product fills the gap between high priced name brands and greymarket junk. As I'm not a professional photog, it fills the bill without breaking the bank. Nice move on recommending it with camera purchase.$LABEL$1
Complete Bourne series in Hi-def. I already have two of the three in regular DVD. When I heard that Amazon was going to bundle up all three in HD-DVD, I decided to have it reserved. The price of Ultimatum by itself is more than half of the price Amazon was asking for all three. So why not??Watching all three on 1080p was well worth the price of admission. Bonus Features of HD-DVD discs are good extras not found on the regular discs.I wish the discs came in an official sleeve that binds all three together, but they came as separate discs. A good buy!!$LABEL$1
Borrow it, don't buy it. Other reviewers have listed the flaws (basically an Ode to Metallica, ignores important bands, dismisses punk entirely, etc) but I also have a juvenile negative reaction to anyone listing "living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn" in their bio. That one sentence speaks volumes about what is inside. No judgement, I live in Williamsburg, too, but...The book is interesting, but not worth the cover price.$LABEL$0
Didn't work for me. I installed this item in place of the factory-supplied belt on my Powermatic 64A table saw (excellent saw, by the way). The saw was already running quiet and mostly smooth, but I was enticed by the thought of it being even smoother. Installation: The belt kept riding up on the pulleys, though I hadn't changed the alignment, and I had to mess with the motor mount, and mess, and mess, for about an hour till it spanned well. When it was mounted, the belt seemed no smoother but a LOT louder -- a high-frequency whine the saw never had before. I held off buying this item for a long time, because of the cost, and I should have left well enough alone.$LABEL$0
The BEST wedgie slides ever. I bought a pair of these last summer and I absolutely love them. They are so cushy I wear them to the office, out dancing and shopping.

A little bit of today. We truly enjoyed the movie, "The Prisoner of Second Avenue" especially since today's job market is much the same. Jack Lemmon & Anne Bancroft work wonders. After all it is a Neil Simon play and with talent like that it's no wonder folks keep inviting themselves over for a movie night. I wish more of these movies would be made.Truly enjoy.....The Prisoner of Second Avenue$LABEL$1
Undelivered. I ordered this on Halloween for my daughter's birthday in middle of November. Am still waiting - it's now Dec 3rd! Amazon assures me it's coming (so's Christmas) and which do you think will get here first? Am about to cancel my order. What shabby service. 6 year old missed out on her birthday present is telling me never to order anything from Amazon again. A very disappointed and let down customer. I am hoping this review will shame Amazon into doing something, since it invited me to create a review - without having delivered my order!!!$LABEL$0

Poor presentation. When I orginally got this movie I thought it was going to be a horror movie. Maybe a B horror film at it's worst. This movie would have been ok if I was watching it on an "Afternoon Special" and I was 13 years old again at it's best. I also didn't think that this movie would have had Christian undercurrents as well. It would have been ok if it would have said that on the back of the DVD and I would not have watched it. I was very disappointed in this movie.$LABEL$0

Funny but love between characters not there.... Yes, this book was hilarious; is there another author this funny? I can't imagine it. Anyway, I wished there would have been more romance. they don't have to be Madeline Hunter type love scenes (although they are great)but give us SOMETHING! Their love simply didn't click because they rarely even embraced.$LABEL$1
Dusty, noisy, cumbersome. It seems like I've had to do maintenance on this vacuum prior to each use, as if housecleaning isn't work enough! Cleaning filters, unclogging the hose, reattaching the hose, etc... It's dusty and messy and has been since about the 3rd use. The only thing that's been consistent is the dust coming back out. It's too loud and messy and I'm kicking it to the curb next trash pickup. Wish me luck on my next attempt! Dirt Devils and Bissells are out for me.$LABEL$0
Good niche history book. This book is well written and researched. It is devided into a number of cases in which the author describes the actions and accomplishments of various Quaker educators durring the Civil War era. Noteworthy was their fustrations with Southerners who distrusted any "teachers" from the North, especially ones who sought to educate former slaves. For someone unaware but interested in the history of Quakerism in the mid 19th century, or interested in 19th century women's history, I recomend this book.$LABEL$1
Great Book Scott O'Dell. The Island of the Blue Dolphins is a great book because it's about a girl who is all alone in the island and the girl had to fight so she could live before the Aleuts come to the island. I like the book because it's a true story about a girl who made friends with wild animals that could kill her.I also like it because I like animals a lot and the book is about how Karena make wild friends. I recommend this book because I know you will love it and will want to read it and read it. I give 5 stars to The Island of the Blue Dolphins.$LABEL$1

The Joy of Meditation!. I was thrilled to discover this book and think that it has to get into the hands of more women who may be struggling with forms of meditation that do not serve all of us well. Itoffers liberation from practices that do not respect andlove the human body, especially the woman body, the sensesand sensory pleasures. The authors echoed many of my ownconcerns, experiences, and approaches as a teacher ofWestern-oriented meditation. The book is beautifully written,too--just a joy to read!$LABEL$1
And these people have a problem with Harry?. I happened upon this book quite by accident. I was looking for a bad example of "Christian" authorship and theology (Frank Peretti specifically) and found this.I thought I'd read it all after reading Neil Anderson books, but this is absolutely dreadful. I'm shocked and dismayed that this book even exists, much less that it can be found promoted on the bookshelves of Christian bookstores.My recommendation is burn this book and read your bible. Specifically Job where it is shown that Satan has NO power over us and can do NOTHING to harm us unless God grants him permission.$LABEL$0
A must read for women, parents and men who give a ..... Finally, someone has validated and verified what I've always known...and depended on. Read this first and then get Protecting the Gift and give it to everyone you know with children. It's just too important! Do not fall for the failing social assumptions...You will always know when you are in danger and be able to really protect your family. My intuition has saved me countless times when all around me told me I was nuts to be so paranoid...Heck, I was a bartender...I always knew who was really dangerous! Thanks Gavin, everyone thought I was ?...then later, they changed their attitude...why do you have to fight so hard for sensible safety? Go figure...$LABEL$1
If the books is called "The Moscow Option".... ...then why do we spend the majority of the book everywhere but the Eastern Front?I won't deny or disparage the actions in the Pacific and the role of the British, but if a book is supposed to be about the German war in Russia, perhaps it would do well to spend some time in that setting.Instead, we get exceptional detail regarding British actions in North Africa, followed by hour-by-hour reworkings of American actions in the Pacific - and then we get sweeping generalities regarding the German actions in Russia.The premise and title of the book are largely sidelined, as if they are of secondary importance. Why?In this case, don't judge a book neither by its cover, nor by the synopsis printed thereupon.$LABEL$0
cheap. I have seen the movie many times, and it was as good as I remember it being.However, when I received the DVD the casing and the disk itself was made really cheap. I first thought that I had ordered someone's illegal copy that they had hand made. There were a couple language options, one of which was the original Japanese, as a native speaker, I appreciated this option. However, when the movie plays in Japanese there is no option of not having English subtitles, which was really irritating.I recommend this movie to everyone, but spend the little extra and buy a better copy of it.$LABEL$0
Useless Gimmicks. This cookbook holder is too shallow to hold a book. At best, one can insert several sheets of paper. I was very disappointed as I expected (note the name "cookbook holder") it to hold an actual book. I made the mistake of ordering four and gave all to charitable re-sale shop. Perhaps some craft person can conjure a practical use for these. They definitely will not hold an actual book!$LABEL$0
Great replay value! I like the game.. I had Superpower 1 and couldn't wait for this one to come out. When I first attempted to play Superpower2, the game had trouble starting do to having so many bugs. The bugs were taken care of with a number of patches over the years. I played this game for many hours trying different things with different countries. Most seem to talk bad about this game, but I enjoyed playing it! I would recommend getting the game and see if it's for you. Yes you could go on for days about what the game doesn't do, (like neighboring countries not getting angry for your massive build up of military units). The game is a starting point for other greats to follow.$LABEL$1

Really poor quality. We have owned this printer for a little over a year. The initial setup was easy and it seemed to work fine, for a while. Print quality for the price is good.First problem, 6 months in, was it would only print the last page of multi page documents. Pain in the ---, but I just printed one page at a time. Now, it has stopped scanning from any machine. I checked online and it seems that others are having this problem as well. It says, "unabale to download applications list". I tried all of the 'solutions' offered both by users and Lexmark. Updated the drivers then uninstalled and reinstalled all of the software- twice. Lexmark owes me 4 hours of my life back. Bottom line, this printer is not good at wireless connectivity, and really not good at anything but printing. Buy something else.$LABEL$0
Very Disappointing Book From An Otherwise Great Author. I was so completely disappointed with this terrible book. I loved Generation X, Life After God, Microserfs and Shampoo Planet and count them among my all-time favourite books, but this book is garbage. Truly. I could barely finish it, and I sold it to a used book store as soon as I plowed my way through it. The plot is stupid and absurd and I almost felt embarrassed for Coupland upon finishing it. I agree with many other reviews that Coupland's work has really gone downhill after Microserfs (ie. Girlfriend in a Coma, Miss Wyoming, and this piece of trash) but I sincerely hope readers will not judge all of his work based on this one stinker. I read that Quentin Tarantino has optioned the book, but I seriously doubt even he could make this story good.$LABEL$0
dissapointed. i remember when they first showed a prview of this moive in theatres long time ago in 1999. it was only playing in selected theatres and i wanted to see it pretty badly. few years later i could not find a dvd anywhere i went. finally it comes out and i buy it on amazon and man, was i dissapointed. sure martial arts in movies is great if you like it, but it was not so good in this film. also the special effects which they were praising about in this film looked like a kid in his parents garage made it. in all, this film is lucky to recieve 1 star.$LABEL$0
I'm now empowered with the knowledge to meet my son's needs.. Thank God I was told about this book! Odd how the SI dysfunction diagnosis is about sensations that are not "pulled together" to get the clear picture. This book PULLED TOGETHER seemingly disconnected behaviors that my son exhibited, and gave me a CLEAR PICTURE of his diagnosis, his needs. What a relief! My son is 5 years old, born in Russia, and came to America at the age of 3. While he seems to be exceptionally smart (academically he is spelling a multitude of 3 letter words), he has been extremely hyperactive, fidgety, thumb (and now clothes) sucking, speech delayed, & sound sensitive. I am grateful for the depth and organization of the material presented in this book. It empowers me as a parent to step forward to access the services my son needs.$LABEL$1
Simply amazing..... I went ahead and bought these even after reading several bad reviews about the cords falling apart. That was a little over a year ago and mine are still like brand new - and I wrap the cord around my mp3 player constantly. The sound is amazing...but make sure the earpieces are pushed in properly. They sit farther inside the ear than expected. That makes them block outside noise as well. Also, after finding the right earpiece size, they're very comfortable. These are excellent for the price! If mine decide to die, I'm definitely going to buy another pair.$LABEL$1

Very disappointed. I am a teacher, and I bought two these staplers for everyday classroom use after reading all the positive reviews. As it turns out, these are terrible staplers! The first stapler didn't even make it a week--a student accidentally knocked it off the table, and because it is plastic instead of metal, it immediately broke. The other one made it three weeks, during which it jammed all the time and required lots of pressure in order to staple anything at all. It wouldn't open all the way, so I couldn't use it to staple papers to a bulletin board either. Finally, the second one broke durnig regular use, when I was simply stapling two pieces of notebook paper together. It jammed and was impossible to unjam without popping the spring. I'm not sure why this has so many positive reviews, but I wish I could go back and spend a bit more for some metal staplers.$LABEL$0
It's a fairy tale?. I found this book to be a fairy tale for ocean lovers, sunset lovers and boring escapades of the well-to-do.After one hundred pages I had to force myself to continue reading this book. I didn't want to waste the eight bucks. After 183 pages I finally gave it up. Not for me.Another reviewer mentioned Salty is a book for males. Maybe she's right. It sure didn't have any redeeming qualities for me.I would like to share my sorrow for the death of Ed Bradley with Mr. Buffett. There are many of us who loved him.M$LABEL$0
TouchPoint Bible. I was very well pleased with the purchase of TouchPoint Bible. It was stated as "used" but in good condition. When I received the Bible it was in perfect condition.

BEWARE, PLANTS NOT INCLUDED. BEWARE!!!! None of these products contain the plants. It doesn't state that on the boxes, or in the ads. All you are getting is the tarp-like quality, plastic tube, a cable thing to hang it with and a foam rubber 'collar' to put around the plant that you have to supply. I can't get live plants where I live (an island in Alaska) so both the tomato and the strawberry planters were a waste of money for me. BTW, the strawberry planter takes 15 live plants!!! (Just in case you're shopping) I also located these same things in a store, and the boxes DO NOT STATE THAT THE PLANT IS NOT INCLUDED. So don't think you're geting a ready made garden - you're not! And none of their ads - on TV, or otherwise, state this fact. PLANTS NOT INCLUDED!!!!$LABEL$0
Just Because Modest Mouse Is Popular Now, Does Not Mean The Album Completely Sucks. Sure, it's not their best. All the polish erases some of the charm of Isaac's strained vocals and seemingly improvised guitar work. But it's still Modest Mouse, and it's pretty damn good. I think this is a natural progression from the Moon and Antarctica, with stronger lyrics that often deal with death and the afterlife, and a more "mature" sound (Excluding Dance Hall, which is the closest this record gets to sounding like older MM). I didn't want to like this album, what with all the radio play that Float On and Ocean Breathes Salty received, but listen with an open mind and you'll find that it's actually a good album, my favorite tracks being "Dance Hall", "Bukowski", "Satin In A Coffin", and "Ocean Breathes Salty".All indie fans should give this "sell out" record a chance.$LABEL$1

worst fairy tale book I've seen. The book is super-barbie-girly, both in terms of illustrations and the texts. Every single story reads silly, simplistic, dry and boring. The stories are basically the same familiar old good fairy tales, but somehow the details are altered to make them "morally correct," and, as sideeffects, become very silly girlish.$LABEL$0

Worked well. Import from financial institutions is great.. Worked without a hitch. Cost of e-file puts a damper on this being a great deal.Simple stocks an bonds are easy. The import from financial institutions worked great. All items were easy to verify and had more detail than the forms I received in the mail.Years past, I had a few more complex items and you have to figure out the tax code is talking about (if you can). The TurboTax and its help didn't automatically fix the complex tax code we have. Too bad they didn't have a (better) tax encyclopedia to help you out -- yet, I don't know how they would ensure the accuracy year after year. This year, I didn't have any such stuff to worry about.$LABEL$1
It's Not the Product. I tried to rate this order earlier, but I think it got lost in cyber-space. I have used this product before with good results, so it is not the product per se, but the condition in which it arrived. The item was in its original packaging and appeared to be unopened. However when I opened the box the lid was off the cream bleach, and it had hardened to the point that when I mixed it with the activator it was too dry to stay on my face rendering the product useless. I see no reason to return the package as it would cost about as much as the item itself. I would consider returning it if I am sent a self addressed return package with postage prepaid and a replacement package.$LABEL$0
Braun 6000FC. The replacement foils only last a few weeks of normal service. When they go bad, you know it because of the gouges it takes out of your skin. It is cheaper to buy a Norelco in the long run because of the cleaning solution as well as the need to replace foils often.$LABEL$0
A worthwhile oddity. Here's a tricky question: who is this CD for? It isn't just music, there are some sound effects, and some of the music is very brief 'stings' and 'stabs' (as they are called).Interestingly, the answer may be someone like me. I had the CD on in the background, and some of the pieces are extremely evocative - at least for people who have seen the stories they come from. There are a number of other wonderful pieces - the TARDIS takeoff from the first story is great.But, of course, the best item is the always wonderful Doctor Who theme - 4 versions, including one closing credits, which are all fabulous. I especially like the comparison between the 1967 revision and the original 1963 version, but can't say which I prefer.$LABEL$1

Not the usual. I really liked Acropolis and "Best of Yanni", so when I heard the vocals in this CD, I was *very* disappointed...Yanni fans may like it, but I don't care for it, over all.

Kingsters Unlimited. Not your typical teenager for sure. A very interesting book. I don't think Shawana is ever going to be a soccer mom. A teenager with a very steely reserve. I admire she used what resources she could. Being thrown out of the house at such a young age and making a go to better herself is admirable. I wonder though, if seeing such a seedy side of men will skew her for life. I wish her the best of luck.This book certainly was incredible and very funny in many spots. As she said, she never did anything to these men they didn't want. One thing for sure, there are certainly many more kinksters out there than just me. I've never understood the whole Dom thing but to each there own. I'm glad she had limits and didn't cross the line into prostitution. Would it be fun to spend an evening with her just to listen to her stories. Incedible!!!$LABEL$1
An Excellent Rendition!. I'm an avid fan of The Wheel of Time. Robert Jordan's skill at description really makes the books come alive, but to see actual artists' renditions of his world, as carefully dictated by him, was fantastic. These pictures are exactly as he wanted them to be. You really get to see the characters you have seen only in your mind's eye. To Jordan's credit, these pictures were very close to the images his descriptions helped me imagine.Absolutely worth the money and time to read!$LABEL$1
A Terrific Product!. I bought this for my son several weeks ago because he wanted hot lunches but didn't like the selection at school. Honestly, I bought it mostly based on all the positive reviews. I was eager to see if it worked as well as most people said it did.Well, my son has mostly taken soups to school in it, and he says that the soup is always as hot as if it just came off the stove. Just today he took pasta in it, and he said it was just as hot.In the morning, I leave the boiling water in for just 5 minutes, and the latest my son has lunch at school is 12:15. I prepare the thermos at 6:30 a.m.! It's also the perfect size for a couple of servings and fits nicely in the side pocket of his backpack.I would HIGHLY recommend this product!!$LABEL$1
I Was Ripped Off. I ordered this book as a holistic reference, for which purpose it was a complete failure. I even bought the second book, "More Natural Cures Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease." Not only was the book written poorly, it contains less real information than a supermarket rag. As if I were not defrauded enough, the book refers it's readers to a website (NaturalCures.com) where you can get the "Real, real" information not available in the book due to some kind of government regulations. So now I've paid $36 and change for two books which supposedly contain information on holistic cures, and do not, but they want to further defraud me to the tune of $9.95 a month to join the website in order to get the information which was supposed to be in the first two books in the first place. In my opinion this guy and his publishers should be in the San Quintin book of the month club for bilking sick people out of their money who are disparately seeking a cure.$LABEL$0

Great book for first time parents of newborns, to help you get through the first few months. I'm an expectant first time mom and have read a number of baby books. Many of them, such as "Baby 411" and "What to Expect- the First Year" are great reference books. However, they can be a bit overwhelming, as they tell you all the possible senarios that can go wrong, and also pack information about the baby's first year(s) into one book. This book, on the other hand, is a practical read to prepare for your first few months as a parent. The authors keep it simple, and only expand on common health concerns (such as collic). Instead of scaring you with all the other worst-case health scenarios, they just tell you what symptoms warrant a doctors call. They also break things down into a lot of detail- how to swaddle, how to bathe, how to change a diaper while giving you tons of useful tips that I haven't seen in any other book.$LABEL$1

The Miner's Gold Should Stay Buried.... The Miner's Gold should stay buried, and so should this DVD! From beginning to end, this DVD was a disapointment. I chose to give it 2 stars, although it is more deserving of a 1.5. The idea itself put me in mind of a mummy film- disturb the treasure, and awaken an evil curse. First, the film seemed to "bright" to fit the horror genre. Second, the film score was not at all ominous enough to invoke any type of fearful anticipation (Except for the end of the movie!) Third, the actors looked more like teen-show actors than actors of a horror film. The only good spot in the film was a 20 second strip dance given by a well-built red head. My recommendation...this one should go back to the dust.$LABEL$0

Extraordinary!. This is one of the best documentaries I have seen so far. My husband and I were amazed by the lives of humans around the globe. We have been urging our friends and family to see it. One can learn so much about the survival and adaptability of the human race. This documentary takes the viewer through so many emotions and, honestly, can change the views we have about the humans that inhabit this wonderful world of ours. It may sound like a cliche, but seeing Human Planet can be a life changing experience. I urge the readers of this review to buy it or borrow it. You will not be disappointed.$LABEL$1
Tremendously Entertaining and Educational. I bought this book primarily as a dig at the Fox news network (at 40% off, why not?) thinking that Franken probably wouldn't be much of an author -- then read the whole book in two days. It is tremendously entertaining, well written and a real eye opener. Franken does get a little annoying and petty at a couple of points, but overall the book is very informative and funny. The chapter (in cartoon form) "Supply Side Jesus" contrasting a Jesus who believes in Supply Side Economics with the real Jesus of Nazareth was my favorite part, and should be required reading for every person who beleive that being a Christian means supporting Bush-style economics.$LABEL$1
Boring storyline. Okay language.. i found the plot of this book moved along to slowly to really captivate my interest. i also had trouble identifying with any of the characters. however, the author's use of language may be a saving grace of some readers.$LABEL$0

Best Video but could have made it even better. Hello,I'm one of the phenom's loyal fans. I like this video. There is no doubt that this video is a good one. It contains many wrestlers like Edge, Kane e.t.c superstars and most of the top ring announcers like J.R, King and e.t.c opinions on the Undertaker and his character, but if felt something missing liek they could have asked Mic foley's opinion. And what about some of the best in the WWF, Austin, Rock, Show and e.t.c. Anyway it is good one for an Undertaker fan.$LABEL$1
Would be a great item but hose got holes right away. Sure wish Black and Decker would get their act together. The bag that came with the leaf vacuum lasted 1 season then the stitching on the zipper started to unwind. 2nd season of use and zipper ripped and came off track renderng the bag useless. I decided to try this instead. Worked pretty good, a slight challenge getting the cover to stay on the waste bin. Then notice holes in the hose. I have not contacted company for a replacement yet but can't expect a replacement will hold up any better.$LABEL$0
Great Experience !. Ordered this product for my son for Christmas. It arrieved with in a few days to my disbelief...

Don't buy this machine!. I purchased this machine a year and a half ago to use for about three months out of the year on weekends only. This machine met my ice needs well. The problem is that the ice sensor has now gone out and there is no customer support for my problem. Neither I nor an appliance repair service can find anywhere to purchase a replacement ice sensor. Without this part, the machine is useless. Paying over $200.00 for a machine that only lasted for four months of weekend use is not my idea of a good investment. There is no customer support after purchase. So my recommendation is to stay away from spending your money on this machine. I have to throw mine in the garbage.$LABEL$0
Appearances Can be Deceiving. I have to admit that I'll give Take2 Interactive software credit for thinking of such a great idea for a game, but they really could have put some work into it. The cover of the game looked really interesting and I couldn't wait to recieve this game, but when I tried the game, I wasn't as excited as I was in the store. The graphics are lousy, the sound is crackly, and the whole game is just bad. You run out of money when you first start the game, you can't move around as easily as you can in other simulated games like Sim City 4 or related games, and things don't appear for a really loooong time. It's a waste--do NOT buy this game--you will seriously regret it.$LABEL$0
This book has the best scene in the whole series.... In Novemeber 1997 in Orinda CA, on a book tour for her latest Niccolo book, I had the pleasure to hear Dorothy Dunnett read aloud the "Revels" scene (essentially the last part of Part Three, Chapter 9 from The Ringed Castle) which is my favorite scene in the entire series. She is truly a remarkable woman, still hearty at 75, with a wit and intelligence rarely scene in real life. She told us she reads numerous (sometimes hundreds!) of history books before writing each novel to make sure that nothing in the novels contradicts anything from known history. She has created in the Lymond Chronicles the best historical fiction I have ever read, and the most compelling fiction of any genre I have ever read. When she does her book tour for the final Niccolo book in 2000, be sure to go see her--it may be your last chance to see one of the most remarkable women authors of the twentieth century.$LABEL$1
Absolutely Wonderful and funky.. I absolutely love their music especially "Rock this funky joint". It just puts me in another plane and is one of those songs that you just don't want to sit out.

Love this compact camera.. This is my second Fujifilm camera, its great, we motorcycle ride and its great for me to take pictures from the back of the bike. The pictures are clear, wonderful, and easy to take. I have taken over 20,000 pictures with it, and hours of movies...and they are great. Hubby loves it because he gets to remember all the great places we have been. Glad Santa gave it to me.$LABEL$1
TALES FROM the OVAL OFFICE or IF WALL COULD WRITE. If walls could write stories, this would have been a more interestingly written tome. MONICA'S STORYs' dispassionate tone suggest that the author was trying to protect Monica by cleverly presenting the tale as if nothing sexually exciting took place between her and the president; or the author is merely a gallant gentleman who came forward to give hope and support to a suffering young woman who had made several silly mistakes that had caught up with her and was giving her a public chastisement she and the world will long remember.Regardless what the author's intent, he managed to produce a profoundly BORING BOOK. I highly recommend it to insomniacs who have counted every sheep in the galaxy. It works better than Nembutal, guaranteed! Hopefully, this experience has taught this young lady that she can't have everything she wants and that she better stop wanting other women's husbands.$LABEL$0
iffy service and quality. when i first ordered this product, i was sent an entirely different product (finger cymbals, for what it's worth). upon contacting customer service, which was very polite, i was, soon, sent the ocarina. unfortunately, the ocarina was out of tune (and one can't really re-tune an ocarina). upon again contacting customer service (significantly less polite, on this occasion), i was told that i'd have to ship back the ocarina, at my expense, which, considering the mistakes already made, i thought unreasonable. two stars for the original round of friendliness, but i shan't do business with this vendor again.$LABEL$0
Great light !!!. I really like this light. I found the lighting to be even and with no glare when positioned the right way. I thought that it might be in the way of the buttons but it wasn't at all. I used this light in complete darkness and in low light and it worked just as great in both situations. The only thing I didn't like is it requires a separate set of batteries and the batteries were not included in the packaging. I can't compare to the worm light or the shark light because I have not used either, but I did buy and return the lightboy. I was not able to see the screen very well at all!! It basically put a glare over the entire screen! The traplight was the replacement for the lightboy and after using the traplight I don't feel that I could find a better light in any of the other choices. Buy the traplight! You will definately glad you did!!!$LABEL$1
Another What-If Book. Since Elaine Pagels' Gnostic Gospels there has been a steady stream of books written on the subject of lost options in Christianity. This is a particularly bad example of that genre because it misrepresents the substance and nature of almost every heresy and threat it proposes to assess. Especially weak is Ehrman's treatment of Marcionism which he fundamentally misunderstands and seems to know only from the dated studies of Knox and Harnack. His idea that Marcion's view of God was too "new" for the church to accept is based on a howling anachronism in the dating of Marcion's heresy. In fact there is plenty to suggest that Marcion's solitary gospel and limited collection of Paul's letters corresponded to (and resonated with) the most ancient inclinations of Christian theology. In short, not only yet another case of popularization but a bad job of reading the evidence as well.$LABEL$0

A good starting point. I am currently taking the FREC Salesperson I course and this is the book, as you know, we must use. If you are not taking the State Exam, there is no real reason to buy this book unless you just want to educate yourself. Reason being -- the book's goal, like most of it's kind, is for the student/reader to pass the state exam in the end. Hence, there are probably other books out there that convey similar information that aren't booged down with useless details that only exam takers need to know.$LABEL$1

Wrong part in the box. When I went to install these rotors after I had the first one installed and went to do the other side I found that, though the part number on both boxes were the same, the second box did not contain the same rotor. Both boxes appeared to have the factory seal so this appeared to be the fault of quality control. Because of this I returned all of the parts I ordered for this job and went with Genuine OEM parts. It cost more but the fit was of course perfect and the quality of the parts appeared to be far superior.As a side not I ordered these from Amazon and they refunded my money and sent a return label promptly. I am very happy with Amazon's service.HTH,Robert Loose$LABEL$0

Why do I still own this?. I've had this herb mill for 10 years after receiving it off my wedding registry, and frankly I'm surprised they are still selling it. I thought it would make the tedious task of chopping fresh herbs much easier. Well, it doesn't. Basically, anything even remotely leafy gets macerated and caught on the tines and doesn't come loose. Then, you have to disassemble it to try to scrape off the crushed little bits, which stick together & to your fingers and are hard to distribute into whatever you are cooking. I end up getting out scissors and just using those instead. Don't bother with this...at least for fresh herbs. I guess it might work to chop dry herbs into smaller bits, but I can usually do that with my hands.$LABEL$0

A treasure. I am really into martial arts, and last year suffered a serious muscle tear. I certainly believe Western medicine has its place, but Western doctors were worse than useless to me in this case. The exercises in this book have been instrumental in getting me back on the mat again, and in putting my body back in balance so I don't risk such an injury again. It's also a great resource to have in the dojo for first aid--over the years I have seen bits and pieces of the stuff in this book used by various teachers (e.g. cupping, moxibustion, plasters), and having it all together in one handy volume is priceless. I'm so grateful to Tom Bisio for creating this book--and for helping me put myself back together.$LABEL$1
This product stinks like a dirty diaper. We registered for this product after hearing raves from other people. We could not be more disappointed. Among other things, we were never able to figure out how to get this thing to work. My husband and I have four masters degrees between us, and my father is an engineer. And yet we still could not figure out how to get this thing to work. Out of depseration, we took the genie to the local baby store and after 45 minutes even the staff could not figure this product out. How much genius does it take to make a diaper pail this complicated. We are much happier with the diaper champ.$LABEL$0
This is a GREAT printer!!!. I would recomend this printer to anyone who appreciates quality color photos. It is incredibly fast and suprisingly quiet.

I believe it is a must have for any small business and definetly worth the purchase price!$LABEL$1

RACIAL TENSION SOLVED BY THE GOVERNMENT??. i read this book, and must say that it really got my mind thinking in a new direction regarding racial tension.

Would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a "good read".$LABEL$1
This book is titled incorrectly. The guts of the book are just plain stuff for beginners. The illustrations are of an architectural nature, yes, but the book says almost nothing about creating anything like those illustrations. For instance, all of the illustrations use a hand lettered font that does not ship with AutoCAD, and nowhere is it explained how fonts are copywrited or even available outside the boxed version. Plus, much of the presentation is misleading - it seems that the book is edited for newer version by pasting more stuff onto the end of a chapter. Some key points are just plain wrong. Architects! pass this one up. Worthless to you.$LABEL$0

Not particularly useful. I am looking for a book that would be able to flesh out proper business processes utilizing well defined modeling language/framework. Although UML is extremely useful for software development, the author's work did make its case stand with me on UML's usefulness as business process modeling tool.The examples are too simplistic and the suggested modeling diagrams are far too cluterred for a business personel to understand.(Cluttered diagrams on a simple example) The book would be better if it had a growing case study and used real world examples and diagrams.$LABEL$0
Not what is pictured!. The image for this game is NOT what you get in the box, you're getting Haba's My first Orchard game NOT Orchard (which is different game and which is pictured above). The My First Orchard game is for 2 year old's and is very simple and different than the other Orchard game for older children by Haba itself. I was very disappointed in the wrong image being pictured and buying something that I didn't realize was going to be something else. So please be sure to check out a proper pictured item for My First Orchard, because that is what this seller is selling. Now I have to return it and find the original game Orchard that I thought I was buying before from someone else, hope you don't make the same mistake as I did. I didn't know there were two different Orchard games...now I do. :)Cheers.$LABEL$0

don't like the finish. These are not what I thought I was getting. I expected the "black satin" finish to be that low gloss black wood grain type finish commonly seen on bookshelf type speakers. Instead, it's a rough black powder coat finish directly on MDF particle board. It looks like countertop formica instead of wood. As a woodworker, I have always understood a "satin" finish to mean a smooth finished surface with a subtle luster (as opposed to a glossy polyurethane finish). It seems pretty misleading to advertise these as "black satin wood" speaker stands. There is nothing "woodlike" about them.$LABEL$0

Moon Over Miami is a Technicolor Musical Delight!. Moon Over Miami ranks at the top of the list of Betty Grable musicals. This beautiful Technicolor, musical remake of Three Blind Mice stars Betty Grable, Carole Landis, Don Ameche, Robert Cummings, Charlotte Greenwood and Jack Haley. This is the story of three women who pool their resources and head to Florida to find a millionaire husband for one of them. It would be remade again as Three Little Girls In Blue (in Atlantic City) and once again as How To Marry A Millionaire (in New York). Betty Grable's dance with Hermes Pan is amazing and one of the best moments in her long career.$LABEL$1
Good buy for beginners. Yes, there are a few downsides to this system. It can take up a bit of floorspace, and it is a bit pricey. But... I had this system a few years ago and loved it. I had to sell it when I moved into a tiny apartment and needed all the space I could get. I recently repurchased the item again and don't regret it at all. There are so many exercises you can perform with this unit, and after two and a half weeks I'm already seeing results. This is a great product for beginners or for those who want an inexpensive home gym.$LABEL$1

Not for Serious Photographers!. I was greatly disappointed by the book and immediately returned it. This book contains ONLY so-called "drive-by shootings" - it's obvious this author made little efforts to capture the best lights or composition. These "snapshots" were mostly taken in the mid-day sun, when almost all advanced photographers avoid taking pictures. This book is probably intended for tourists on a bus-tour, but not for serious photographers.If you have money to waste on this book, buy two copies of "The Photographer's Guide to Yosemite" by Michael Frye. The latter book is truly a work of art and I was deeply inspired by every image in it. It's hard to believe these two books - on the other extremes - are priced about the same.$LABEL$0
A must read for the strategist. It covers the 3 basic risks that can derail any strategy: demand risk (no one will want your product or demand is higher than expected), competitive risk: other companies capturing the market and taking away customers and capability risk:that a firm is not able to deliver the value propositions that customers will pay for or the capabilities cost so much that it is unable to make a satisfactory profit. It also covers differentiation and low cost strategies. A rather insightful book w/ numerous business cases. I am taking notes on this book for future reference.$LABEL$1
Baby has fun in it, but chord is too long.. Our little girl enjoys herself while in this jumper, but the chord is too long.

THIS DIET IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH !. This book is "junk science". Please, research it for yourself. It is unfortunate that so many Americans are misled by this kind of supposed dietary miracle. High protein/low carbohydrate diets are inherently unhealthy. These diets are imbalanced, they promote water (not fat) loss, they cause ketosis (which, contrary to what the book says, is a VERY unhealthy state), they are often low in fiber and high in cholesterol and saturated fat. Furthermore excessive protein may leach calcium from the bones. DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. See if the Surgeon General, the American Heart Association, American Dietetic Association, American Cancer Society, and the American College of Sports Medicine agree with this diet "revolution". These organizations may not always be right, but they're right about this one.$LABEL$0

Sorry to see it go!. I have been drinking and loving Good Earth Tea for years. I make it cold in the summer and hot in the winter... everyday! I ordered a case from Amazon last week and upon opening the first bag, I knew something was wrong from the smell but tried it anyway. It was horrible. I called Amazon and as always, they were wonderful about refunding my money. Then I called Good Earth and found out they changed the ingredients and some boxes are the old flavor and some are not. They said they now have 3 blends. Well, I can't begin to figure out which one I am getting so I am onto trying other types of tea! So it's been lovely but no more Good Earth tea for me!!$LABEL$0

Includes every step from soil to sprouting to tending and harevsting (and recipe ideas too!) for various types of veggies. All the author needs to do is add a chapter on saving harvested seeds, and it'll become the absolute home gardener's "Bible."$LABEL$1

Very Happy. I am very happy with this antenna. Wanted to get rid of our expensive satellite bill and this works just great for the local channels. We get over 74 local channels in the Los Angeles area with this, even the ones listed as violet on antennaweb. I love that it is so low profile verses the larger antennas. Was a snap to set up- just unplugged to feeds to the tvs in our house from the satellite dish and plugged them into a splitter. Took maybe 2 hours tops to set up and get going.$LABEL$1
Just read and see!. This is the best Bible translation I have ever had the opportunity to read. I read in four different languages and so far this is the best, translated and interpreted Bible I have had in any language. I investigated a lot before I started meeting with the church in my city. Every accusation I encountered was either flat out a lie or a result of blindness. It troubles me that God's children are deprived from such reaches that are in the ministry of Witness Lee. We all have been gifted with a mind. If a seeking person utilizes his or her mind with an open spirit he will see what I saw in the Bible when it is opened the way it is in the Recovery version. Just read it with an open being!Most of what is said about brother Lee or the Recovery version is not the stand of the church.$LABEL$1
Disappointment. Such a waste of time. No basis to the book. Completely distorts bible verses out of context. Would not recommend this to anyone.$LABEL$0
Brand name and price isn't always a good indicator of the product. Taylor is well known for quality oven thermometers. I purchased this one based on their name and it was their higher priced unit. The "Connoisseur" in the brand name also swayed me to make the purchase.Although the bracket/stand the thermometer is supposed to be attached with provides for various ways of putting it in the oven... none of them work well at all. If it is clipped to a rack it can't be read. Hang it sideways... can't read it. Hang it facing the door... you can't read it. Lay it on the bottom rack (which I ended up doing) and it's readable but very difficult to read. And, it just gets worse over time as the lens tends to get coated and turns brown.I just ordered the Cuisinart brand of oven thermometer to try instead. It looks like it has an easier to read dial with better color coding.$LABEL$0

Careful! Read all the details.. I am only giving the product a one star rating. Why? I ordered Nature's Way Thisilyn based on the description displayed prominently at the top of the page. It states: Nature's Way - Thisilyn, 175 mg, 100 veggie caps.NO, NO, NO! Look more carefully, you only are getting 60 and at premium price at that. Further down it states: Package Quantity: 60This is absolutely a rip off.Nature's Way Thisilyn is an excellent product, however, read all the details or pay the price. You can find the 100 capsules from other sources and the price will be reasonable.SHAME on these rip off artists!$LABEL$0
Did nothing for me. This was another disappointment as far as energy and alertness. I felt nothing different even after doubling up on the dose. I think I still have half a bottle or more left.

Bought for my 8 year old son. Talk about being upset!!!!! My son thought he was getting a camera like Mom's but this camera did not work right out of the box. We thought we had set it up wrong, or the batteries were dead...couldn't get it to work even after reading the little booklet and changing the batteries. When we tried to download his pictures and mine, the computer kept saying that there were no pictures to download! A complete waste of money it's going back for a REAL camera!!$LABEL$0
A Good Way to Start Easing your Worries.... Easy to setup. Got its first unfinished basement reading in about 2-1/2 days, and held within .2 or .3 of that reading for several days. I then moved the unit, and got a stable but .7 different reading in a little used corner of the family room. Seems to do exactly what it claims.Only way to know would be to get a couple of units, and exchange their locations over time. If you get a high reading, you would maybe want to get a licensed inspector/contractor to come over. If the reading is not high, this may be a lesser cost way to ease your mind...Customer support is excellent - nice people. I would recommend before paying for a contractor, and even after , before letting someone proceed with thousands of dollars of remediation.$LABEL$1

Essential reading. John Bamberger's translation of the Praktikos and Chapters on Prayer by Evagrius Ponticus should be required reading for anyone interested in the ascetic theology of ancient Christianity. Not only does he render the challenging, often elliptical, Greek of Evagrius into approachable English, but he prefaces the two works with an invaluable introduction. This century has been one of enormous progress in the study of Evagrius, and any reader of the Chapters on Prayer and the Praktikos will appreciate why such effort has been expended. Evagrius still has much to teach us.$LABEL$1
As other noted, it is junk. I only charged and used it 3 or 4 times. It just went completely dead after a few months. Stay away.$LABEL$0

Disappointing. 32 000 photos to choose from, and this is what he comes up with?? Many of the pictures are black and white, out of focus and grainy. The panorama shots are very poorly composited from smaller pictures. I’ve seen much better seamless versions of the same photo series in other books. Numerous pages are simply empty. Just black. There are many great photos in this book, but they are too few to make it a good buy. A few google searches will turn up many more great photos than you will find in this book.$LABEL$0

It's always good to hear another side of the story. I'm glad to have finally read this, I knew it wouldn't be as exciting, having already read Into Thin Air, but I'm certainly glad I picked it up. The Good: that we get an account of what happened from Boukreev, an explanation of his rationale and additional accounts of Fischer's expediton. We can only imagine/speculate how worse if would have gone had Boukreev not been there. The Bad: the writing. It felt disorganized, poorly constructed, disjointed ... Boukreev could have used a better co-author.$LABEL$1
#1 Steroids Book For 2003!. I read this Monster of all steroid books Steroids 101. Jeff Summers pulls no punches and leaves no question unanswered (even questions you would not think to ask).

Does not fit Vans with Stow and Go Seating!!!. I am normally a cautious person and have worked for years on cars, trucks, and jeeps. I bought this item after checking the website and it indicating it would fit a 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan.However, that is not the case. After getting the box, and finally getting time to install it I find out it will not fit 2005 Dodge Grand Caravans with Stow and Go Seating/Storage.This was a waste of my time and money and the product should at least state caveats in the description when checking if it will fit or not.I will probably not be ordering parts from Amazon again. Pro-tip Call the manufacturer directly next time.$LABEL$0
Disturbing, but for different reasons. An account of an American intellectual who submerges himself in the common rubble to learn their horrible violent, racist ways. Interestingly, each chapter is preceded by a small clippet from Victorian accounts that define and demonize the mob, i.e., the working people. Equally disturbing are author's metaphors that consistently compare people with animals. This book is exaggerated and indeed fabricated for the most part. Does violence occur during football matches--yes it does. But the author makes no attempt to explain this behaviour on a personal level; he views it as mob mentality. Furthermore, it downright insulting to the British public, which may or may not be a good thing. It is interesting, but the tone of the book is not objective--it's an elitist account, written in inflated diction, of an upper class professional "trying" to understand the vulgar culture of the masses--culture that is made of thugs, Nazis, and alcoholics, according to the writer.$LABEL$0

The best jazz album of all time. This album would have to rank as the perfect album to a perfect summer's day. It is hypnotically beautiful and takes you to places you've never been before. Tony Williams' hi-hats in the title track provides the mood for the album and all the musicians make an incredible contribution. Oh, and Miles is on fire.$LABEL$1

Turning point. The Killing Dance held a true appeal in its romance and relationship issues for Anita. The plot of Sabin, Dumane and Cassandra however was wasted in an attempt to throw Anita and Jean-Claude's relationship into a more mature level. I feel that the older triumvirate could have been more developed as characters, in order to give more groundwork to the Richard, Jean-Claude and Anita triangle. Hamilton tends to let the deeper plot overtake the relationships sometimes, but in The Killing Dance, she put way too much focus on Anita finally choosing between her two preternatural boyfriends. The powerful ending helped draw together the novel, and especially with the reconnection between the three main characters. All in all, the book was extremely entertaining, and Anita is now going to have to face a maturity which she has not had previously.$LABEL$1
Entertaining. I thoroughtly enjoyed this movie. It is not rocket science but that's not what I chose this movie for. Bridget's character is not flawless. She is insecure but of good character, overall. Her chosen boyfriend is not terribly exciting but he's good to her/good for her. They genuinely care about each other. That is what is refreshing about this movie.I save 5 stars for Gone with the Wind or Polar Express, but this is close.$LABEL$1
unclear information. I was disapointed and surprized when i recieved this product. Nowhere in the sescription did i see that the deck was mini. The cards have to be less than an inch in length. I would not have been so disapointed in the product if I had known this before buying it but i was expecting normal sized cards and these that i have bought will not work for the reason i bough them. You would think that someone would have the sence to mention that the cards ar mini!!!$LABEL$0

If the books dont get better i am going to stop reading the series.$LABEL$0
so repetitive !!. I dont understand why this book gets such good reviews.... the writing is mind numbingly repetitive and the point gets lost.

Can't get my child out of her new wagon!. We gave my daughter this wagon for her first birthday. She loves it! She wants to ride every morning before work and again in the afternoons. She brings friends along (human and stuffed) and there is plenty of room for four small children. The high rails allow a good view but keep her safely inside giving Mom enough reaction time when she tries to stand in it (which she does frequently!)The big wheels make for a smooth comfortable ride for all.I HIGHLY recommend this affordable, safe, classic toy.$LABEL$1
Unimpressive. I am a fairly experienced trombonist, and I purchased the cd looking for a recording of the Serocki, which I was performing at the time. I found Sauer's interpretation to be robotic, and I felt as if he didn't find dynamics to be important aspects of music at all. In my opinion, he is being a technician and not a musician on this cd. His playing is entirely unimpressive, and not worth listening to at all. I recommend purchasing a Joe Alessi or Christian Lindberg cd, myself.$LABEL$0
CELTIC WOMEN. I FIRST SAW "CELTIC WOMAN" ON THE LIVE SHOW PRESENTED ON PBS BOSTON AND IT WAS VERY ENJOYABLE.

Disappointing. This is a nice looking unit, although the knobs are poorly styled compared to the rest of the exterior. The knobs are also not particularly good ergonomically. And those are the good parts. As many other reviewers have noted, the unit does go off at times for no reason and makes a continuous noise akin to a smoke alarm, only not as loud. In the middle of the night, this can be a little unsettling. The top is not properly insulated, so it gets very hot during operation. The toaster rack does not get pulled out when the door is opened. You need to reach in, which is not as safe as the alternative. The bottom tray is plain steel, not polished stainless, like others in this price range. It does not have a door in the bottom for emptying crumbs. My 10-yr old cheap Black & Decker is better overall. Until I find a toaster-oven that is nice looking AND functional, I will keep the old one. Verdict: if you want to try it, make sure to buy it from a place that will take it back for any reason.$LABEL$0
This is a good debut solo album!. Beverly Crawford's debut solo is really good. It is well-produced with well-written songs. One of my favorite songs is the beautiful "Praise Jehovah." My other favorite is the rousing title song. Then my other favorite is the hip-hoppish "I'm Yours", a song which should have gotten more airplay and one out of which she should have made a concept video. She deserved a Stellar award and Dove and Grammy nominations for this album. But I'm glad she won the Vision and GMWA awards.$LABEL$1
For DVD/Movie Lovers!. I was accustomed to watching movies on my laptop but being back in school prompted me to acquire the Toshiba Portable DVD player. I bought the product and had it shipped to my home in Kingston, Jamaica, West Indies. To my delight the connections worked in my vehicle, any electrical outlet available and even on my new 40" Sony Bravia TV, and don't forget that it's portable - once the battery has been charged you can watch up to two or more movies on battery power alone. My girlfriend and I are avid movie watchers and we watch movies after work. Previously accessing the movies on the laptop was a chore for her but since getting the portable player she doesn't wait for me anymore - she watches them sometime during work hours. My co-workers love it, my children love it and guess what, I love it so much I am planning to purchase another. I recommend you purchase this product. It's one of those great buys you won't regret.$LABEL$1
Clay is a class act!!!. BOTW is amazing! Clay did a fantastic job and really blew the top off that song, although the choir background may be a bit too much at times. Still great though. My fave is This is The Night! It's a beautiful, powerful song, and with a voice like Clay behind it, well it is a real masterpiece!!! No wonder Clay has been #1 on Amazon presales for 3 solid weeks!!!!!$LABEL$1
Its big... isnt that what it said?. Another solid Cold Steel knife. It is big that is exactly what it said. The blade is really 6 inches. Over all open it is 13 inches. If that is too big for you this is not the knife for you. I use mine every day. It is a work tool and I love it. It keeps its edge, opens right out of my pocket. It is a well balanced and tough knife. Worth the money if you are looking for a quality large knife.$LABEL$1
Another one of 'those'. that doesn't resolve itself. Multiple stories going on at the same time - I don't mind guessing games, but I like films where the guessing ends when the film does. Perhaps this is 'intellectually challenging' for some in college art class,,but this old technique just seems to go on forever. I liked the acting - I liked the visuals. Felt like going down a ladder where the bottom 5 rungs are missing. Academy Award?? Are you kidding??$LABEL$0
Yes buy, but...... Yes buy (it's Stephanie Lauren's), but the hero and heroine are unusually dim in the last third of the book. I mean California clueless...I mean frustratingly dense...I mean "hanging chad" stupid...oh you get what I mean. But hey, it's Stephanie Lauren's....$LABEL$1

Cute Movie. Thought I'd write this review to counter all the negative reviews. I really enjoyed the movie. Didn't generally care for the Mark Ruffalo character, but liked all the other participants. I think it was better for the Jennifer Anniston character to be concerned before her marriage, than to get married and to realize that it was a mistake. Really liked Costner's character. And agree with all of the positive reviews about Shirley Mclaine. It probably helped that I loved "The Graduate". But "Rumor.." is a fun movie. Just relax, ignore the "other" reviews and enjoy the movie.$LABEL$1
Must Have High Speed Package to Work !!. I ordered this phone cord because I noticed that businesses and public libraries using broadband phone cables for high speed connections, but apparently for home users you must have the total high speed materials installed for it to work. My internet connection is still the same as it was with my narrow phone line no different, except for not being disconnected as much. If you want high speed connection just chalk up the extra money to have some company hook it up for you, doing it yourself will not WORK !!$LABEL$0

Great book for those beginning in game programming!. I've rented (am renting) this book from a library, however it has no CD-ROM. (It's missing!) Anyway, from glancing through, it's a great source for learning graphical programming. (I wished it spent a little more time on 2D programming and page flipping/scrolling though, mapwise, not scenery-wise), but it's still a great book) A must order! :-) (unless you don't haven't a credit-card like me, you probaly won't be able to order online...) :>$LABEL$1
Great for the price! Few "VERY" minor flaws.. I bought this product for my mother and my mother-in-law. It has a picture that looks great from far, but is far from great. If you're 5 feet away or more, you will not notice the pixelation. As you get closer, however, you will start noticing every pixel on the picture. The transfer of images is simple and the speaker is a good addition. The speaker isn't the greatest, but how many picture frames do you know that have a speaker, it's not for music videos, it's for pictures.Overall: Great gift idea, and if you want perfection, go ahead and spend that $150-$200 on another 7" frame. This one is just right for my wallet.$LABEL$1
Get out the bugspray!. I mistakenly purchased Rand McNally 2000 thinking it was the updated version of the software I have been using for years. I had so many problems in the first 2 days, I called customer service who walked through all my problems and came up with the same bugs on her end - she agreed with the problems, but had no idea how to fix them! One example is the measuring tool between 2 points - it doesn't work on the icon, only around it, which leaves up to a 1.5 mile variance in any given direction! After telling her how frustrated and dissapointed I was with this software, she gave me the address to return the product for full refund (90 day guarantee).Later, I realized it was Microsofts trip planner 98 and Streets 98 that I had been using. I am ordering the Microsoft 2000 version today (and returning the other product). According to other bad reviews for Rand McNally 2000 and the great reviews for Microsoft, I am not alone!$LABEL$0
It does not work beyond 30 days as the 5 installs were used. This is our favorite version of Office. We were excited to get it for such a good price. However, when I attempted to register the product, it said this disk had already been used the allotted 5 installs. So the software is effectually a 30 day trial. I could have downloaded that for free. It would be best if the number of installs left were listed with the product.$LABEL$0

A Biblical Reconsideration of the Apparitions of Mary, 3rd ed.. Biblical Christianity is not `polytheistic' as some "christian" religions, in this case, one which not only prays to Mary to act as an intermediary between them and God/"co-redemptrix (Where is this found in the Bible?), but to various "saints" to help them in their lives instead of solely to the one, true God of the Bible, practice it. Great subject to clarify that Jesus Christ is the only one who redeems us from our sins; the only one through whom we can know we have eternal salvation (e.g., Acts 16:31)! Very simplistically written w TMI! Could have summed it up in a few pages, rather than proving and reproving his points.CAdvoc$LABEL$0
JUST DOESN'T CUT IT!. WHEN DEALING WITH A MOVIE LIKE THIS, YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC. I MEAN, COME ON, YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT ROSE LOOKED SEVENTEEN? YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE JACK WAS THE HERO?

THIS IS A FILM WITH MANY, MANY FLAWS WHICH UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE EVEN CLOSELY CONSIDERED TO BE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! I MEAN, THE DISASTROUS SINKING OF A SHIP THAT KILLED OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH A CHEAP AND FAKE LOVE STORY.*AND DON'T THINK I DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE, CAUSE I DO.

Very simplistic gameplay ruins the fun -- boring after one play through. I was expecting some level of strategy but virtually all aspects of the game are wholly simplified. A great disappointment once you realise the look of the creatures is the only amusing part of the game. I'm pretty sure a patch or add-ons would _not_ make the game better.On the issue of DRM, others say it better than I can. If the game was already cracked _before_ the game was released, DRM solely penalizes the folks who actually bought the game.$LABEL$0
Suspenseful, clean and wholesome -- thanks MHC.. Another winner by my favorite suspense author. I've read all of Ms. Clark's books. I anxiously await the release of a new one and always buy them in hardback -- can't wait for paperback! When I finish, I pass them on to my 14 year old granddaughter who loves them as much as I. Especially great is that I don't have to worry about Ms. Clark's books being unfit for my granddaughter to read. They are very pristine when compared to today's standard fare! The way I calculate it, there should be another one released soon. I can hardly wait.$LABEL$1

Hard pill to swallow. Let's see--you've got the unappealing main gay character, desperate to be straight...a jock addicted to anti-depressants...the alcoholic sex-addicted gay best friend...and the frumpy straight girl who drowns her sorrows in rocky road ice cream and phone sex lines. Add it all up and you have yet another painful addition to the growing list of gay movies with potential that just aren't executed well at all. At best this movie evokes laughter when it probably shouldn't, at worst you wonder if you're watching a bad school play where you're the only one in the audience wondering, why does this hurt so much to watch?$LABEL$0
It was SO close to being a good game. I bought this game expecting to be amazed at how cool the graphics looked.... I was impressed!.... At the graphics. The gameplay, on the other hand, sucks.

I find it so funny how people who don't even own the game come on here and say that it's such a great game. I bought this game along with Metal Slug Advanced and Wolfenstein 3-D. I can promise you that I will not be playing "DRIV3R" any time soon. Not to mention, I'm gonna buy Doom 1 & 2 soon, so this game is gonna be gathering dust for the next 10 years on my shelf. Don't buy it.$LABEL$0
Works alright. The sound quality doesn't seem to be much better than with the italk alone, BUT, on the plus side, it cuts down any harddrive noise from your ipod that gets picked up by the italk sometimes. I use mine for lectures in a relatively large lecture hall and the professor doesn't use a mic. When they do, the sound is great. I only have to turn up my volume about 3/4 for the sound to be good, but when they don't, I have to sit near the front and turn the volume up all the way. My advice would be to buy the italk by itself (or any other voice recorder, it's the only one I've used and I like it) and try it out. If the noise of the harddrive bothers you, THEN get the mic.$LABEL$1
Bible Basher. I really wish I had properly read the reviews, especially the negative ones, as I did not spot that this was a Christian based book. I am not anti-christian, I just want to be able to think positively, as the title might suggest it can bring. But this book will only help you if you have an open mind to that religion. Otherwise you will not gain much from it at all.$LABEL$0

Daring American Theater by an underrated playwright. A courageous work that deserved the Pulitzer. It's American Theater of the Absurd at its best.The familes dysfunction is depicted in a disturbing climax. The title depicts the family's metaphorical "skeletons in the closet" in a quite literal way.Be prepared, this is not your usual drama. If you enjoy the absurd, you've come to the right place.$LABEL$1

this book makes me angry!. Dr. Larimore's book is a gross misrepesentation of my home.. Bryson City. Making the residents seem to be back woods olfs and idiots! It may be based on a true place but the book is a work of fiction and should therefore be presented as such.$LABEL$0
This video was a real disappointment! Don't buy it!. This VERY SHORT video was bare minimum...barely better than a home movie. There were literally no tips on where to find fish, how to present lures or how to fight the fish. Only two flies were shown.

Farenheit 451. I've never thought of myself as a book-burner, but after reading the beginning of this book i'm prepared to make an exception in this case. This is the most facile piece of intellectually insulting drivel I have ever read.Armed with a topic which offers a wealth of material for a skilled satirical writer, PJO totally missed the boat on this one.There is only one reason anyone should buy this book: as a self awareness test. If you enjoy this work you should get the message that you should give up reading entirely and concentrate on more intellectually enriching pursuits, like reality TV.To save someone else from having to experience this text, I am going to burn my copy; or perhaps grind it up for compost.$LABEL$0
13, so what?. JoJo is 13 and isn't to "young" to expirience problems in life,and she is not to young to express her feelings in her songs. Not every 13 year olds life is picture perfect. I am 14 and i find JoJo to be and role model. She sings about things that actually do happen, like her boyfriend cheating on her. And yet she does not come across as a whore in her videos. I am proud of what JoJo now has and i hope to meet her someday. JoJo has inspired me in the world of music.$LABEL$1
Worth the Read. This book is worth the read because: 1) It is a clear, accurate depiction of the accuracy and limitations of using mitochondrial DNA in tracing human migrations over tens of thousands of years; 2) It shows how mitochondrial DNA achieved this position, overcoming strong initial resistance from the scientific community; 3) It is a well-written account by one of the key researchers in the field; and 4) It shows DNA from the Y chromosome confirms the evidence of the mitochondria and offers similar possibilities for tracing paternal ancestors.The book finishes with imaginative biographies of each of the seven "daughters". Interesting enough, but if that's what you want, you might be happier with something in the Clan of the Cave Bear series.The only question left unanswered is where do I send some DNA to find out which of the seven daughters is my purely maternal ancestor?$LABEL$1
No Minty Tingle. I'm not sure what's going on here or why there are such discrepancies between the reviews but recently I received this product from Beena Beauty Holding Inc. I was expecting to experience a minty tingle on my scalp as I have with the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree product I've used before. Unfortunately the shampoo went on just like any generic shampoo except with a very strong and synthetic lavender (and to me unpleasant) odor. This definitely doesn't jive with the majority of the reviews and I'm wondering if Amazon hasn't mixed all the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree product reviews together. The strong synthetic lavender scent lingers for a very long time. I won't be able to use this product due to the strong odor. I plan on looking into this to see if I can get to the bottom of it. Hopefully I can return these two bottles.$LABEL$0

Slow, but brilliant. Many of the other reviewers have complained that this book moves too slowly. If you go into it expecting a rollicking adventure, then you'll be disappointed. This is not a novel of swords and sorcery. It's not something that you could pull from transcripts of your last D&D; campaign. And that is very much in its favor.Stevermer has painted a picture of the life of her main character. She is not your typical fantasy heroine, nor is she a wilting flower waiting to be saved by the big strong men. She's an individual, and the joy of the book is learning about Hail.The book expects more of you, too. Unless you're familiar with Renaissance Europe, and have a more than passing acquaintance with the Arthurian legends, you'll find many of the references obtuse. But for the rest of us, Caroline Stevermer has given us a rich world full of memorable characters, and my only disappointment is that the book was too short.$LABEL$1
One of the best musical purchases I've made in a long time. Great music, profound lyrics, and a deep sense of sprituality - Fred Hammond delivers. Not a novice by a long shot Hammond's vocal style and delivery is truly a gift from God. Buy the CD - buy the DVD - you won't be sorry.$LABEL$1

Little More Than I wanted To Spend, But Well Worth It. I'm 5'11, 230lbs, large build, on a budget.I searched 2 months all over Amazon and the net for a bench that was solid, not expensive, and would support me without the rattle or shakes that you would expect from cheap benches. I initially didn't want to spend no more than $150, but after reading some of the reviews on this and others, I told myself you get what you pay for and decided on the Bowflex 5.1.I've had it for a month now and I am glad I decided to pay a bit more for quality. It's solid, supports my head for flat bench presses, doesn't rattle at all (helps if you buy some floor matts), looks and functions like gym quality benches (If not better). Has more options in angles for incline than the cheaper benches. I would reccomend it for anyone looking for a quality bench but are afraid to pay $230.$LABEL$1

My Favorite Conspiracy Theory!. I am absolutely enthralled by this theory. I heard about it on unsolved mysteries (where they mentioned this book), and, after reading it, I am so sure that this is what really happened.

Not only does the evidence convince me, it just makes more sense that it would happen this way, you know?$LABEL$1

My copy of Rock Record by Terry Hounsome & Tim Chambre. My copy, worn torn and cherished of "Rock Record" by Terry Hounsome & Tim Chambre was published in the US in 1981.

Too basic and repetitive.. I was very disappointed with the content of Ms. Collins book, which is an extremely quick read. After buying this book on impulse, I felt swindled by this amateur feng shui consultant.The book focuses on the practical elements of Feng Shui: don't place your bed or desk so you can't see the door, don't buy furniture with dangerously sharp corners, clear away clutter by throwing away what you don't need or love. These common-sense ideas are repeated ad nauseum for each room of the house. A good writer would have cut half of the text.If you like books such as "Who Moved My Cheese?," which I hated because it was overly simplistic and made a two-page paper into a book, you will not like this book.If you want a very quick read, simple ideas, and some horrifyingly bad pictures, be my guest.Maybe I'm a hypocrite; I did follow one bit of her advice. After reading the book, I threw it in the trash.$LABEL$0
Serve with port, glowing embers and your dog nearby.... With the publication of Modern Pheasant Hunting, in 1982, outdoor writer Steve Grooms told us how he hunts pheasants. In Pheasant Hunter's Harvest, he tells us why. Too long in coming, it is a book that was well worth the wait, reflecting maturation in Grooms' prose and appreciation of his subject. Along with Datus C. Proper's Pheasants of the Mind, it is one of two volumes that goes to the heart of pheasant hunting with eloquence and understanding, and stands ahead of all others. Served at the hearth with a glass of port and a trusty pointer or retriever nearby, it is a book that can be consumed over and over again, reminding us that why we hunt is more important than how. Currently out of print, it is that rare work that deserves a place in every upland bird hunter's library, and if not in their library, in the glove compartment of their pick-up truck.$LABEL$1
Best video series I have found. I have purchased several of the video series. Baby Genius and Bee Smart are pretty good. I also having the Signing Time videos. While I love Signing Time, my son is not quite into it yet. None of them keep my 7 month old fascinated like the Baby Einstein series. I have the language skills, bach, Mozart, and Beethoven. Doolittle is a little disappointing. I have not purchased Newton yet, and may not, due to reading of the reviews. But, in comparison to the other series out there, Baby Einstein is the top. I still use the other videos, because they seem to provide more direct education. Yet, I have to work harder to keep my son's attention with the other videos. Just today, my son was getting fussy and would not soothe. I turned on baby Mozart and he has not made a peep. I may not get him to sleep anytime soon, though.$LABEL$1

Trash. I watched a few episodes of this show on the recommendation of a friend and I'm not sure what appeal this show holds. It's full of paparazzi jerks running around making life miserable for everybody around them. The characters are all really disagreeable - except perhaps the psychitzo photographer. Also, at least one scene per show borders on hardcore porn. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because it does have some innovative cinematography. Still, the show overall feels like reading a tabloid mag in the supermarket aisle.$LABEL$0
Could have been better.......... I've been a fan of Eddie's for years. I felt that this package did not do him justice. I'm not disputing the choice of material on this CD, it's just that Eddie had such a cache of material during his Motown tenure that I was truly surprized that more wasn't included. What happened to "Son Of Sagittarius", "Eddie's Love", "The Thin Man", "One Tear" and all those other tunes that deserved to appear on a collection such as this? It's truly not fair. It's bad enough that Motown/Universal won't re-release his most popular albums. I gave it four stars because it included my favorite EJK song, "Girl You Need A Change of Mind" in its entirety and because to this day I still love the man. Motown, show Eddie's fans some respect and at least release some of his albums on CD, like PEOPLE...HOLD ON or EDDIE KENDRICKS!$LABEL$1

Nice examples. If you learn about design from reading, this book isn't for you. It teaches by giving visual examples. The text does nothing more than analyze the design.

Detrimental to a child's music education!. First, the physical puzzle is fine. Just don't put the batteries in. Unless you want your child to learn to distinguish between bland, non-descript synth patches from a cheap Casio keyboard.How hard could it have been to use an actual recording of the instrument for each piece? This company could easily use a public domain wave file, or better yet, ask some musicians or music educators to contribute a short melody. You wouldn't need access to an expensive recording studio, either. Today a cheap $300 handheld record would do the trick.$LABEL$0
Anti Christian clap-trap. For those who believe the Bible is 100% literal (it isn't) and who dwell on suffering self abuse, this book will help fit disperate and unrelated bits of shaky history into a predetermined and particularly ideological mold they may feel comfortable being poured into.But it is a history of a very STAID and stagnant Jesus--something he or what he taught was NOT. He was a radical liberal (even the New Testemant--written centuries after Christ's death admits to this), who challanged notions of church bound hierarchy's.It's a shame that organizational religion (like the Southern Baptist Convention) promotes disdain for what Jesus taught--individual personal relationship with Jesus and God. Not to mention disobeying Jesus' teachings by mixing their lusting wants for power (government) with their narrow minded brand of cultlike brainwashing.$LABEL$0

This book is not an effective guide to teenagers.. This book not only will not help you with your teenager, it could very well make your life a living hell. It talks a lot about how to play mind games with them and talks nothing about the trust building and responsibility training that is necessary to work with any child. Example: If your child chooses not to take a shower or put on deoderant, this book suggests dousing them with the grossest smelling perfume that you can find. This not only shows complete disrespect for your child but it teaches the NOTHING except cruelty. If you need help a better book would be - "Uncommen Sense." It is an excellent book and gives you great advice.$LABEL$0
Solid collection of early Martin work. This is a solid package of George R.R. Martin's early short stories. But the quality varies. "Song for Lya" itself is a moving, involving, vivid, haunting, 5-star CLASSIC, & is reason enuf 4 buying the book all by itself. Also very good R "With Morning Comes Mistfall," "Second Kind of Loneliness," & "Override." Some of the rest is disappointing: "The Hero" was Martin's 1st-published story, & it's ... not bad. "FTA" is a brief joke. "Slide Show" features a series of dazzling images, but it's not much of a STORY. "Exit to San Breta" is an OK haunted-car story on a freeway of the future. "Dark Were the Tunnels" has a WAY better (& longer) sequel in George's SANDKINGS collection. But the best stuff here shows what George could do 1nce he hit his stride, & is a good curtain-raiser 4 some of the great stuff U'll find in his other collections.$LABEL$1

the amazing trance. Quite a stunning bit of workmanship - the masterminds behind it have certainly produced an album worth buying. A very good all-around record; dance to it, play it in the background, sit down and listen to it intently.

Absolutely altogether a fantastic trip into elsewhere.$LABEL$1
Different from their previous albums.. but still excellent!. Lonestar never ceases to amaze me! They are an excellent group with great songs and great talent. "Lonely Grill" is different from their two previous albums in the sense that I don't think it sounds as country. In fact, a few of the songs sound like pop rather than country. But I think we need to realize that country music is changing and this type of sound is what's popular right now. Best songs on the album are Amazed, Smile, What About Now, and the accoustic version of Everything's Changed. I didn't care for the first song on the album, Saturday Night, but the rest of the songs were good. I definitely recommend this album, especially if you are a Lonestar fan like me. You won't be disappointed!$LABEL$1

Never Again. I've owned this specific design as well as another design from this brand. The first I bought and the second was a gift. But if I ever receive this brand as a gift again, I will do everything I can to return it. Both sets broke so easily. I had a bunch of plates break while in the dishwasher. Other plates broke while being eaten off of. One broke while my boyfriend was eating a waffle off of it! A waffle! So it's not like it takes excessive force to damage these things. They just break right down the center every time. Plus, the bowls and mugs get EXTREMELY HOT just after a couple of minutes in the microwave. If you scratch off the paint, you can see a shiny, metallic surface underneath. I've read the other reviews where people have had no problems at all. I guess luck is just involved. But I wouldn't recommend taking the chance on these plates unless you have the money to throw away.$LABEL$0
Re-Packaged New Age Nonesense at the Expense of the Faithful. Editing review - I did not intend to give five stars but ONE star. Full disclosure, when I first read this book, I thought it was great. But that was when I didn't know any better. Today, I can tell you that this is one of the most inauthentic primers of our faith out today. It claims to promote and praise ony branch of faith (Traditional Yoruba), while mocking another (Santeria), but then offers what is basically thinly veiled Santeria. His explanations and descriptions are out of the New Age cliche catalog. If you are just starting your journey to Orisa, pick up Joseph Murphy , Wande Abimbola or just about anybody else. NOT THIS BOOK. santeria.blog.com$LABEL$1

Dead Battery.

ant farms need ants.. It took 5 months for the ants to arrive, by that time the gel had dried significantly. Fortunately all the ants were dead, so no problem. Customer service was kind enough to send a new gel farm and more ants. 2/3 of the new ants arrived dead and they remaining 7 barely do anything. My son is embarrassed we gave one of these to a friend as a birthday present and is very disappointed with the toy.$LABEL$0
flimsy. I have used these type of dressing aids for years without problems. Unfortunately, the manufacturer's decision to engineer flex into the shaft of this one makes it almost useless. The second you put any weight or resistance on it when using it for its intended purpose, it starts to bend and keeps bending until the article of clothing slips right off the s-hook. The thing is so flexible, it bends to 90 degrees, which is simply overkill. i would believe it made the dressing aid cheaper to produce, however....$LABEL$0
still plays with it. I bought this a couple years ago for my niece/nephew & when I go to their house, they still have it out & use it. durable, cute and good learning tool$LABEL$1
Fragile and TINY. Ok so bad me for not appreciating this book is only about 1.5 inches square... very small! Cute, but tough to handle. More importantly, my toddler ripped the cover off on day two - and she is generally gentle with books. Cute but very tiny and fragile. It's also hard to know what captions go with what, so challenging to associate the text with the appropriate animal.$LABEL$0
Bought three, two have failed!!. I was introduced to Tivoli by my brother who had a early model PAL radio. Bought two SongBooks for myself and one as a gift for my father-in-law. Really not happy with these radios. The sound is mediocre at best and I would say better for listening to talk radio than music. The blue SongBook (I bought red and blue ones) has the worst sticky finish on it and its impossible to clean and feels disgusting to pick up. The REAL reason I have to give it such a low rating is failure rate. One of mine died completely and had to be shipped back to Tivoli. My father-in-laws did the same thing and they blamed it on a faulty power cord but would not ship him a new one until he shipped them the radio and cord for assessment (and the courier charge was not covered).Finally, don't let these radios sit in the sun as they overheat and shut down. We use them by our pool but have to put them in the shade under a chair or else they fail in about 30 minutes.I would not buy another.$LABEL$0
Good expansion, but very short. Rainbow Six: Eagle Watch is really a good expansion set for the original Rainbow Six. It only has 5 mission though. Even though it only has 5 missions, they are pretty hard, and they take place in famous places, like Big Ben in London, the US Capitol Building, and the Taj Mahal in India. There are 3 new weapons, and they are the Heckler & Koch G36K, the Heckler & Koch G3A3 assault rifles. Also, it includes the IMI .50 caliber Desert Eagle, which can kill anyone in one hit (usually).Even though it is short, it is a really good expansion for the first Rainbow Six game.$LABEL$1

not a good deal. I bought 3 of these shirts for my husband and they are SMALL so order two sizes bigger for sure. I will not ever buy from this store again as I paid $31.99 for each shirt and they only refunded me $23.99 plus I had to pay $15 to ship them back - so basically its not worth it.$LABEL$0
Bait and Switch. I attended a showing of this movie and was a little put off by the rabid intensity with which it was received. During an after show Q and A, any criticisms were booed, and people not completely embracing the film-makers' belief-system were branded close-minded and victims of a biased western educational world-view.I won't blindly follow anyone and did not appreciate this kind of mob rules mentality. Before closing people were encouraged to post on message, news-groups, and review-boards as often as possible.This movie was a jumbled mess. I think it's true purpose can be exposed by the many other products and services being offered under the What The Bleep Umbrella. . .Interestingly enough if one follows the money it leads to the door of a 35,000 year old spirit from Atlantis named Ramtha. This franchise has just taken it to the next level.$LABEL$0
Freddy Invades the Real World!!!. After The Final Nightmare, Wes Craven is having nightmares again, so he decides to write a new script. Beacuse the Nightmare films have ended, the 'real' Freddy decides to come to our world. Wes Craven, Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, John Saxon are some of Freddy's targets he tries to kill. He tries to get Heather's son, Dylan too. The real Freddy is a lot scarier and more evil than Robert Englund could ever portray! Heather decides to play Nancy one last time and kill Freddy...for good! If you love the Nightmare series, and a movie within a movie, you might like WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE!!!$LABEL$1
Velocity -- a fast-pased performance!. I have read and enjoyed most of Koontz's novels. I just about quit reading this one because it was a little more "graphic" than I like, but I did finish it and am glad I did. Koontz writes an intelligent and engulfing story. I look at his picture on the jacket and can't imagine that such a delightfully pleasant looking man can possibly carry such devious plots of murder and perversion in his head. He does have a mishevious twinkle in his eye, however. I always enjoy the perspective Koontz provides between good and evil, and, somehow, I am left with a peaceful feeling at the end, even though, at times the evil seems so encompassing.$LABEL$1
Disappointed. First to start out with, I'd like to say that Dee Henderson is an amazing writer w/ the special gift of writing. I would not recommend this book. The other books she has written (O'Malley Series, Danger in the Shadows) were very well written, w/ the feeling that your can't turn the pages fast enough because it's so good. Unlike the others, True Valor was slow read, and I found my self skimming and completely skipping whole pharagraghs. But even tho I don't recommend this book, the others books by Dee Henderson I HIGHLY recommend.$LABEL$0
Another winner for Robert Crais. Always get the audio books to listen to while driving. This is another winner by Robert Crais.$LABEL$1
Another Look. Bryson did a fantastic job of pumping fresh life into subjects and historical figures that have long gone cold in modern re-tellings. Newton, Einstein, Linnaeus, and a host of scientists crossing every discipline come to life as real people in the times, often bizarre times, they lived in. I could not have been more impressed with the ease with which he writes about complicated subjects and the sheer joy and astonishment captured in his prose.$LABEL$1
Inexpensive and it works great!. This is a nice, inexpensive, easy-to-use appliance. I bought this for my 83 year old mom who doesn't do much cooking anymore and has a hard time stooping to use her oven. She loves it! It's easy for the elderly (and non-technical people) to use, it's compact and doesn't use much counter space. I highly recommend it for the price.$LABEL$1
Thrice Staind. Staind's newest album 14 Shades of Gray, has that same special something about as Break the Cycle and Dysunction. Staind's music contains a little something something most other bands dream about, it's called truth. Aaron Lewis is a real person, who has the ability to take his thoughts and emotions and turn them into an astonishing sound. All of Staind's albums are the kind you can pop into your CD player and get that feeling in the middle of your chest that makes you say [WOW!]. 14 Shades of Gray is definately worth the [money], pick it up, and if you have more money pick up BTC and Dysfunction.$LABEL$1
Filth, Porn, totally disgusting movie. This is possibly the most disgusting pornographic movie ever made, which tries to get people interested in ancient Roman history to buy it. It is nothing but graphic hedonistic porn from start to finish. It's a slick way for the porn industry to spread their filth where it otherwise would not be able to. If you are a Christian, stay very far from this movie. It will sicken you as it did me.I bought it only because Peter O'toole is in it. I cannot for the life of me imagine why Peter O'toole agreed to be in this filthy movie.I have marked on this movie case: smut, porn, filth; not worth watching.$LABEL$0
Rabbit Proof Fence. RABBIT PROOF FENCEThe movie was GREAT!! It was suspenseful. You never knew what was going to happen next.The 3 aborigine girls were always being followed by the tracker. They were also helped alot by people that you never would of thought. For example a white farmlady gave them food and coats.A white man helped them navigate which made the movie more exciting.I like this movie. I think people should watch it. I also think it is bad taking kids from their families this is why they called the thousands of Aborigine children taken away "The Stolen Generation.BY: ParisBordeaux5/14/04$LABEL$1

Awesome. I purchased the wave and let me tell you, THE BEST THING TO RIDE! Whenever I go down the street everyone stares and ask what is it. They all say they want one too.

Not the Lenmar 1120 mAh item. I received MaximalPower 800 mAh batteries instead of the Lenmar 1120 mAh batteries advertised.

They were very nice to talk with.$LABEL$0

Good beginners book. I bought this book as a beginners guide to Celtic Shamanism.

Disk was so scratched that we couldnt watch the movie. We love the movie Ratatouille. We were sad when we noticed that the DVD was missing from our collection of movies so we decided to look at Amazon to get a copy. We looked at the used copies because the new ones are still @ $20. So we looked at the used ones. We found on that said Condition: Used - Good for $6.86. We ordered it. It came in when expected and with much anticipation we opened it so we could watch it that night, only to see an incredible amount of scratches on the disk. I was shocked. I could accept a couple, but it looked like it was on the floor of a car in the back seat for 6 months. We tried to watch it any way and got through 30 minutes with only a few pixelated moments and a couple stutters. Then it happened. It started stalling for 3 seconds, then 5 seconds then it froze. As far as rating the movie itself, I give it a 5 star! but the quality... I have ordered a lot from Amazon, I am very disappointing.$LABEL$0
Beauty Comes From Within. I just bought this high priced fancy looking toaster. Are you kidding me? I figured it was just a fluke that this toaster toasted unevenly/ burned one side while leaving the other side untouched. Sad to read that everyone that has purchased this toaster has the same issue. The question is - Why would a company with a great reputation like Cuisinart sell a toaster that doesn't even work? Apparently they don't think it is necessary to test the product./If you are considering this due to the beauty of it - Forget it! Beauty comes from within.$LABEL$0

Self aggrandizing. If there is a Donald Trump in the nanny business Ms. Kline would surely be hosting the next Apprentice show except that she does not seem to have the same gravitaz that Mr. Trump demonstrates. Name-dropping and full bragging of how important she is to the "over achieving" parents who are basically folks trying to integrate work and family lifestyles does not make Ms. Kline a likeable decent person. (Whether you agree with how the parents are spending their time or not)Instead of being empathetic, Ms. Kline comes across as a self-ordained I-am-a-very-important person in Washington. She brags about the fact she can choose you as a client and gets more important clients than she really cares for.The book is a quick easy read, but there is no substance and a lot of snide remarks on Ms. Kline's clients make her a character that any parent should stay away from.$LABEL$0
Use Your Illusion I. I own both "Use Your Illusion I and II" and UYI 1 is definately the better of the two. Illusion I shows just how hard GnR can rock, while Illusion II focuses more on suicide and the darker side of life. If youre a GnR fan this is a must own. If you like this then youll definately love their debut release "Appetite for Destruction."$LABEL$1
BORING. Had to read this book for school... it took everything I had not to throw it in the fireplace and turn it to ash.

No.This is a boring read.. move on to something else if this is not a mandatory read.$LABEL$0

Don't waste your $. I bought this player ($160 at my local Costco) for my husband for Father's Day. We spent many hours trying to get the software to work, and I never did get songs transfered to the player. Also I couldn't find a way to delete files from the player (it comes preloaded with some music--most of which was not our taste). The users manual is terrible, there are no support phone numbers, and the RCA website just refers you to the manual. I will be returning this player and buying another brand.$LABEL$0
To Kill a Fruit Fly. 02/08/10Dear shoppers:My cats recently picked up fleas from their vet. For over twenty years of cat ownership we never had a problem with fleas, as we exercise a very strict protocol on contamination controlls.It was with an extended vet hospital stay that my cat brought home "unwanted guests" FLEAS!!!The vet recommended [...] and flea traps to augment their demise. Simply stated the VICTOR FLEA TRAPS do not work!!! The best they do is to trap harmless fruit flies and some gnats.I still have a flea problem as I was lulled into thinking that my home was flea free by the fact that I did not trap any fleas and my cat had only pickedup a few fleas (My vet stated).Well the traps are useless!!! Scientifically I do not know why I did not realize that, I panicked to be free of the problem.Save your money and just use a vet approved topical flea med on your pets.Sincerely:MOLARMAMA$LABEL$0

Cheap watch of low quality. This product has the feel and quality of a very cheap watch (don't let the picture fool you). Although the Amazon price seemed great, the watch isn't worth half the price.

Surreal and exceptional. I wasn't sure what to expect before watching this, but by the end of the film I was stunned by how well it had been assembled and presented. The distinct lack of narration and guidance allow Andre and Calvin to lead the viewer through the communally warped and surreal psyche of a pair of ruthless and motivated teenage killers. Not since the original Blair Witch Project have I seen a film that has been successful in maintaining the illusion of being amateur film re-assembled by professionals, and this one being based on a tragic string of events that we're all aware of is particularly haunting and surreal. The two young actors do an exceptional job and are very believable. Scenes are wonderfully assembled in mounting tension and the film reaches a tremendous crescendo through which I could hardly blink. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1
The Island of Dr Moreau soundtrack is truly a masterpiece.. The music focuses on the humanity of the beast people in the movie. Gary Chang is a genius. Through his work the emotions are more clear cut in the music than in the movie. Even people who don't watch The Island of Dr Moreau will appreciate this rare chance to feel the music in their bones. It unleashes primitive desires within you. That is something hard to find in the music world today.$LABEL$1

Henckles Knife Block rocks. Great purchase. Perfect price. Helps me organize the knives to find them fast. Keeps them from cutting anyone paging through a drawer. I had 2 blocks...messy look in the kitchen. This one holds all I usually use and looks so sleek.

The price is sooooo good. I hope you like yours too!$LABEL$1

obviously written by 2 people.... Two books in one! You're reading one story - and toward the end someone else takes over and writes an ending for something that makes no sense based on the original plot. Obviously James Patterson got to a point and couldn't finish - and left someone else to tie it all up. Unfortunately the way it was "tied up" was so lame I'll never waste my time on another of his books.I don't expect literary value from a read like this - I just thoroughly enjoy the escape. However - this one just pissed me off and prompted my first ever book review. Did the person that actually write the ending even read the novel? If so - they need a new job...$LABEL$0
An absolute dud...I wasted my money, so save yours!. In my opinion, this thing is flimsy and worthless. I set it up in the doorway and it is so poorly designed that it just doesn't hold. Once you bring the bar crashing into your forehead on your first or second chin-up, you realize that you've already thrown away your money and now it's time to throw away this product. I ABSOLUTELY agree with the reviewer who cautions against making this product available to kids without close supervision.$LABEL$0
What a Great Start!. This guy is honest, period! He tells it as it is. Nassar never makes claims that day trading is easy or that the course will deliver trading results, but instead teaches the mechanics of day trading. I got more from this course for $300 dollars than two solid years of trading. I only wish I had taken it sooner. I also saw this guy trade at the Ontario Trade show with live capital. He made $1700 right in front of 10 people in less than than 10 min. That was really cool watching a man walk his talk!Buy this course, it is undervalued and delivers so much.$LABEL$1

Beautiful hero story..... This was SUCH a beautiful story and I am completely in love with it. John Carter is a man out of place and time (and planet) who doesn't want to be the hero. In the end he does and finally figures out where he belongs. The special effects and action are wonderful and I found myself cheering for John the entire time. There are some comical moments that tie in with the story. I truly enjoyed this movie and will definitely own it once it becomes available.$LABEL$1

2nd review. I wrote a review before and it was not posted. This video for the money was vey disappointing. Some scenes kept being repeated, and for the price the quality was not good. It showed people smiling, close ups and bad views of Lake Chapala which was repeated. My video had blank secions in it when all I got was music. I like the mexican music but felt it was repeated over and over for the whole time. I never lost the audio, just the video. I would not recommend spending money for it, unless it were 10 bucks.$LABEL$0

Great comedians but not a great story or script. I've seen these four in movies and TV shows that have made me laugh till it hurt. Shockingly I did not laugh once at this film. I can't blame the cast because if you see Tropic Thunder, 21 Jump street, The I.T. Crowd Wedding Crashers and then this film you will know what I'm talking about. "Spoiler" It is yet another story where aliens come to earth and they are evil monkeys. I wish they did it like 21 Jump Street and made the threat be distracted by the incompetent heroes and then busted. Also the aliens were ridiculous. I feel like someone or some people did not use the talent that was in this film for some odd reason. I thought there was great chemistry between Bed Stiller and Richard Ayoade and I hope they do another film again.$LABEL$0

One of a Kind. Although it is true that this movie is not blessed with great acting. However the plot is enjoyable although completely unbelievable.

Iggy Pop fan? - Then don't bother.... I am a dyed in the wool Iggy Fan, and love all of Iggy / Stooges material from 1969 throughout (Ave. B is so so though). Wake up suckers is very poorly recorded, and the quality and sound levels change from track to track. Iggy sounds really wasted on several tracks, and even forgets the lyrics to Gimme Danger ! You are way better off buying Iggys studio albums and Raw Power. Especially get FUNHOUSE! Unbeleivable stuff for 1970 ! Also New Values, and Soldier are supreme IGG-Monster.$LABEL$0

It got great crash test ratings and seems to be very popular.The straps don't twist that is the best part. Very expensive but worth all $200 we paid for it. We bought an evenflo car seat for our 4 year old two years ago and we hate it. We are now going to throw out the evenflo and buy a Britax marathon for her. These car seats are priced high but well worth the investment in my opinion.$LABEL$1
Doesn't fit on jeep sun visor. Bought to add light to my Jeep Wrangler...problem is, despite the picture, these do not open wide enough to clip onto the hard Jeep visor.Also the pivot point is far too loose and they wiggle too much and don't stay in place.Certainly not worth $10, even if they would clip on as advertised$LABEL$0
Great until it died. I bought this from Amazon on June 24th and it is now dead, a little less than 6 month later. You put a disc in and it just spins and spins and never loads. This DVD player was used nightly for several hours. A sad replacement considering the old DVD player I had lasted 7 years. If you're looking for something to replace in months, this is it. Otherwise I would spend a little more money on a better quality product. The RCA player I have downstairs has lasted longer than this one. I guess you get what you pay for.$LABEL$0
Way to Small. I thought this product was way to small. It was not what i expected at all. It says eight and up but is way to small for any child to have a tea party with and actually use. Looks more like a decoration then something you could play with.$LABEL$0
I know this is free but it's no excuse for garbage.. I was quite excited to see some Ezra Pound on the kindle for free. But I was quite disappointed by what I downloaded. Everything looked like it was cut and pasted poorly. I should point out it was free so you get what you paid for. Hopefully some day there will be some decent Ezra Pound collections on the kindle.$LABEL$0
This is better than you think.... I pre-ordered this item thinking that it was not too much money and lets see how it works. I live in a Condo and dont have to do the snow removal, but there are times you want to do it. This was so much fun, it works just like a regular snow blower and it takes the snow right down to the drive way, I would recomend this item to any one who has just walks or decks to do, it worked great on the drive way but does take time. But most of all it was FUN..............$LABEL$1
One of the best wheel cleaners out there....PERIOD.. I used this product for the very first time this weekend (March 1, 08) and was VERY impressed with the results. I followed the bottle's directions, and I DID use a soft bristle brush to agitate the cleaner. The Hot Rims Wheel Cleaner dissolved ALL of the brake dust and road grime on my car's alloy wheels with EASE. Other products have left spots here and there, but this made short work of cleaning my wheels and left them with a sparkling shine. Try this product, you WILL like it.$LABEL$1
so-so a pre-teens reveiw. i think this book just okay. i mean it was clever and funny, but one thing really pushed my buttons: the author could not decide if it was a fantasy or realistic fic. like, sometimes he portrayed her as a mystical, magical, majestic being from some sort of fifth dimension galaxy, but most of the time she was another unique teen struggling with high school issues like boy friends, popularity, and peer pressure.$LABEL$0
Good Buy. This comforter set is very expensive looking and made of excellent qauality materials. For the price this is a steal. Highly reccomend$LABEL$1
Great for storytelling!. When I was in high school I was in Forensics, which is a after school program in which one category that you could compete was storytelling. If I had this book then I would of surely done well. That aside, my 6 month old loves this book. She smiles really big every time I start to read it. I also love to read it everyday. I would highly recommend this book!$LABEL$1

Bad versions of good songs.... TSIA. This album contains some of Phish's finest songs in their career. Such wonderful tunes as "REBA" and "squirming coil" which are a delight to hear live are here rendered as lifeless, unfocused, energyless rot. Now I have a feeling that I may get some flack for this someday but can anyone who has heard any of these songs live truly say that the studio tracks come even close? PHISH's first two albums are dull, musaky, and low-energy, partially because they hadn't figred out how to use a studio yet, they just tried to recreate their live performance. If only they had learned what they learned by "billy breathes" and applied it to the songs on this album, the album woudl be outstanding, but the result here is almost unlistenable. Check out the bootlegs for the real stuff, kids.$LABEL$0

TALES FOR A JEWISH INDIAN. One of the strangest nuances of this book is Ed Eagle, who everyone seems to think is a Native American, but as we learn later, he is really a Jew and was accepted as an Indian because of his basketball prowess. Okay, Mr. Woods, that's original. Too bad the rest of the novel isn't quite so fresh; but indeed SANTA FE RULES manages to weave an involving, if somewhat hard to believe tale.Anyone who's read a great deal of mystery novels will see the truth in this novel very early on. Woods does manage to throw in a neat twist at the end, but it only enhances what an astute reader will have already figured out.Woods writes like a screenwriter; much of his narrative would transfer well to the big screen. A little faster pacing would have enhanced the book as well. But if you're in the mood for a superflous but highly entertaining read, SANTA FE RULES delivers.$LABEL$1
Yes Veronica, there is a good guitar record this year.. Dweezil Zappa's "Automatic" is stunning not only for its diversity and musicianship, but also for being able to surprise you again and again as you get more familiar with it. Many of the songs seem to open up after a few listens and there's some wonderful guitar playing here. Dweezil's brother Ahmet, who is underrated and a terribly good vocalist, sings on "You're a Mean One Mister Grinch", and Lisa Loeb makes an appearance as a secretary in "Dick Cinnamon's Office." Blues Saraceno, Mike Keneally and others play on the record also. Coming out on Steve Vai's record label Favored Nations, it's no surprise that it's a brilliant record from a guitar point of view, and you won't tire of it quickly. Highly recommended. This is Dweezil's best record yet, possibly typing with Z's "Shampoohorn"!$LABEL$1
Lose 30 Pounds in 30 days; Weight loss secrets they don't want you to know about. I loved this CD. I listened to it twice and took notes. They make lots of sense and are things that conclude with other books I have read. I strongly agree with everything in here. I would recommend this to everyone. Not just people trying to lose weight but for general good health.$LABEL$1
Intelligent and rewarding.. Intelligent due to the intriguing nature of the story which keeps you wondering. I won't spoil anything here but I thought it was brilliant.Rewarding because Christina Ricci is naked in it a lot and also resembles a dead person, enough said.$LABEL$1
Rollicking analysis of an S&L's collapse. James Shea adopts a twangy vernacular to skewer the inflation and deflation of Don Dixon's Texas savings and loan. Dixon took advantage of deregulation and profited handsomely. Whether it was intentional fraud or opportunism is up to the reader to decide, but the book is written like a summer detective novel. It's better than so much of the hack work out there, and it's true! I recommend this in addition to "Funny Money" by Mark Singer.$LABEL$1
May make you very itchy!. If you have sensitive skin, this detergent could make you very itchy. I normally use Free and Clear All. My wife brought this home a few days ago. The first load of my clothes I did in it lit my skin up - no visible rashes really, just made my skin burn a bit and feel like bugs crawling all over me, especially in my facial hair and scalp where I touch with my hands.Beware of this if you have or if others in your house have sensitive skin. Residue can stay behind in the washer/dryer and it will affect others if they have sensitive skin even if they use a different detergent.$LABEL$0
Just Can't Cut It !. I was drawn to this book title because I have been collecting some wonderful fabrics that have large designs and I have seen some beautiful quilts displayed in my local quilt shop that made use of these large patterned fabrics. By buying this book, I get several patterns at a cost far less than buying the individual patterns from the quilt shop. I am especially interested in using Asian fabrics and there are 2 quilts pictured in the book that make use of these fabrics. I can't wait to get started on some masterpieces of my own$LABEL$1
you better sit down. I didn't like it as much as XO at first. It seemed a bit too lo-fi, but after many listens, it revealed itself to me. His songs just open up. The storytelling is so vivid and the emotion so intense, you can't keep away. When you hum Elliott Smith songs, it's not just because of catchy melodies. I am in love with the songs on this album. "Ballad of Big Nothing" is the best song recorded this decade. GET THIS ALBUM.$LABEL$1
One Star Is Too Much For This Awful Album. I am going to summerize my feelings about this album in ONE word: UGH! Trust me, this is terrible! Don't even bother. If someone tries to sell this to you RUN, don't look back, RUN fast! It's really bad rock/metal from a band that should've called themselves C.R.A.P. instead of T.S.O.L.$LABEL$0
Spaghetti western collection. I'm sorry but I thought the image quality was much better. Instead it looks like the movie has been filmed by an old mobile phone in a cinema. I am disappointed.I have some of them in a single dvd issue (nothing to do with this new MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT version) and they are much much better.What's the point in producing something so cheap (in price and quality) if at the end you can't stand the vision of it?Sorry for being so strict but I really wish I could to return them all back to you.(Unfortunately I bought several collections of these ...uncooked spaghetti!)Thanks for asking.Max$LABEL$0
Disappointing. I agree with the other disappointed review. The rainbow didn't curve, the dolphins didn't stand up, and the pool kept deflating (obviously a hole in it). Too much work for a nice sunny day when I just want to go out and play with my toddler, not work while my toddler plays. I'm going back to a standard plastic pool after this experience.$LABEL$0
Not an accurate representation of the Leo Frank trial. There were some issues getting this DVD to work properly that I never experienced before with other DVDs. I have heard others say there were some possible defects with it missing portions of the miniseries and so forth. I was finally able to get it to work and what I saw was appalling. This miniseries makes a grotesque mockery of history and what really happened at the Leo Frank trial. Dozens of people did not stand up in the middle of the trial and start singing with the result of the trial coming to a screeching halt. This miniseries about the Leo Frank case is one of the most racist, prejudiced, dishonest, slanderous and defamatory treatments against Southerners ever produced.$LABEL$0
Agenda science. Sociologists are normally very meticulous about how they design and conduct surveys and interviews. I found the questions the author posed to be unclear and subject to criticism, or to alternative interpretation. The individual quotations from adults who experienced divorce as a child have a complex underpinning that deserves further analysis: I suspect that many of these respondents are synthesizing an experience, sort of "making the best of a bad history." In any case, I don't think this book does more than try to substantiate further the theory of good divorce by interpreting grown children's responses to the best advantage of that theory. Not convincing.$LABEL$0

A tiny, useless piece of junk for everything but toast. The oven part of this thing is so small that you can barely fit in anything worth heating up. If you don't use the tray and try to heat up a hot dog, say, be careful, because odds are the hotdog will roll of the back of the wire rack (which has nothing in its rear to stop things from falling off) and into the very bottom of the machine, where it will be an enormous pain to get out again.It toasts fine. That's about it.Go for something bigger, something better designed, something that doesn't make you want to throw it from the top of a very high building.$LABEL$0
Way, way diluted -- not resemble photo. Take the citra-solv in the photo (the orange citra-solv we fell in love with), fill a bottle one-third with it, then add 2/3 water and voila -- the current citra-solve. WAY WAY more diluted. Not even orange as in the photo but a pale yellow. Shame on you, Citra-solve.$LABEL$0

This book doesn't tell you too much. This was not a very informative book. I thought there were a lot of good ideas and a lot of different concepts brought out in it, however the author did not go into very much detail on any of the subjects. I thought it was also a little disorganized, the author seemed to delight in making the reader skip from section to section. I would keep looking for another book, this one is a definite one star.$LABEL$0

this book is not for the average person. This book was assigned to me as a reading for a book review in my cultural anthropology class at Mississippi State University. I thought that this book was a difficult one to read because the layout was hard to follow. The names began to get jumbled by the fourth chapter. The story line could be good if it was brought to the audience in a more typical and easy to read format. Less rambling on and on would be great. I have never read a book that took half a page to describe a creek...it would have been ok if the book was about the stream but it wasn't it was about like 50 people and eachof their life stories...It stunk!!$LABEL$0
A outstanding wireless controller. The Wavebird is, by far, the best wireless countroller out there. With 16(yes, 16) different channels, you can be sure that there won't be any outside interference. In addition, the Wavebird has a claimed 20 feet range, but mine can go well over 40. Dispite all this, the Wavebird still has an ample 100 hours of battery life. Being a casual gamer, My Wavebird has lasted me from September to mid-March and still going on strong. For those who complain about the lack of rumble, know this: vibrations require a motor which sucks up battery power like nobody's business. So unless you want it to have a 20 minute battery life, quit your yapping.Recommended at the highest level.$LABEL$1
Doesn't work with all table tops.. We can't use this at our table!! Our table has a support that runs along close to the edges that drops the clearance by about 3 inches. This is not a problem when you are sitting on a chair but when you use the booster seat there is only an inch or two for our son's legs to fit through and it will not work. I guess this would be a problem with any booster seat but still - it would have been nice to know. So the booster seat we bought is sitting in the living room right now and getting no use whatsoever. We can use it at our outdoor table which has a tabletop that extends out past all the supports but at this point our 20 month old would rather sit on a regular chair even if his shoulders barely clear the table. I think I will just use a phonebook when he needs a boost.$LABEL$1
Not much to "Touch and Feel". If you are looking for a book to offer your child textures to feel, this is probably not the best book for you. The book is actually more about animals than a garden and the textures are very small. The colorful pictures are nice.$LABEL$0

iTalk = Handy VOICE Recorder. The iTalk recorder makes very adequate voice recordings on my 3G 40 Gig iPod. I've had no problems with freezing (or any performance issues). Before using iTalk, I read all of the reviews, and following the helpful suggestions from other users, I've had good recordings from the first.What's terrific about iTalk is that you can organize your recordings in iTunes. As another user mentioned, you can create playlists of related recordings that can later be burned to CD-Rom.Two drawbacks for me are the volume level of iTalk's speaker, which I find too low for adequate playback even at top volume on my iPod, and the lack of a carrying case to protect and identify the iTalk in my purse.Would I buy again? Absolutely. Would I recommend? Without reservation.$LABEL$1

Another argentinian is doing great!. This seems to be the age of the great argentinian tenors! Apart from Cura, Marcelo Alvarez is gaining recognition for himself because he has a beautiful lyric tenor voice with shinning top notes and exquisite phrasing. I love this CD, the repertoire is chosen with great care, specially the Favorita, Duca d'Alba and Puritani arias, all sung beautifully. Highly reccomended. Maybe Marcelo will be considered to record I Puritani with Ruth Ann Swenson (wouldnt that be great?).$LABEL$1

Compact Disc Player/Recorder. I've only had this item for about a week, but it has performed very satisfactorily during that time. My suggestion for improvement would be that the remote should be able to turn the player/recorder on and off. Also, I have other Sony products and this item is similar in that it's operation is far more complex than similar items made by other companies. I think that is because Sony consistently tries to include every concieveable function in their products. However, after reading the manual several times, I think I've learned the system. I'll review it again though before attempting to do any recording.$LABEL$1

The Corrections. ...P>At first, I laughed a lot and thought the book was funny, entertaining and well-written. However, after about 200 pages, I became a little confused and a lot bored. What is the greatness this book manifests, I wondered. The writing ceased to be entertaining. The characters began to seem extremely foolish and unbelievable to me. The peculiar juxtaposition of dates and time seemed arbitrary and unnecessary.I still don't understand why so many publications whose reviewers I usually respect think this is such a great piece of writing. In reality, I think a great hoax has just been perpetrated on us poor unsuspecting readers. I DID read to the end but I'm not recommending this book to any of my reader friends.$LABEL$0
Only works with a Windows OS. FYI - this device only works with computers running Windows software. If you run Linux - well, move along...nothing to see here...I contacted D-Link about the drivers, and there are no plans to make Linux drivers for this equipment.Note: I own and use other D-Link hardware. This was disappointing because it is not made clear that Windows is a requirement.$LABEL$0
Useless - 5 year olds can't push buttons. We bought this for our 5 year old twins for Christmas. I thought the rubber jelly coating would make them durable -- it does -- but it covers the push-to-talk buttons making it impossible for a child to press the buttons and tricky for adults too. Even when the buttons are pressed to talk, the reception is full of static. Very dissappointed.$LABEL$0
Good for a religious book. "For Christmas and bows,"Winter coats and a sled,"To say, 'I love you,'"God made red."Each of the seven colors in this book (white, pink, yellow, blue, green, orange, red, in that order), a Thomas Kinkade painting with the color featured prominantly and a verse similar to the one above is presented. Each verse ends in, "God made..."If you are looking for a book with religious overtones to introduce colors, this one is charming.$LABEL$0
Don't buy it. Ours broke apart after about 2 years. It's made of cheap plastic and just painted chrome, it's hard to get many average cans to align properly (this was an annoying problem the whole time), and I would not buy it again nor recommend it. Not worth the price and not well built. Try another brand.$LABEL$0

Misleading picture. Okay, the product itself is good. HOWEVER, the picture is completely misleading. The picture shows a plastic bag with the white pads that are almost as big as the bag... What I got was a big plastic bag with the pads maybe... a third of the size.... You can't even see the pads because they were on the bottom of the plastic bag. It is absolutely not worth the money and a complete waste of the plastic bag! So not eco-friendly. Why would they need to put such a small tiny product in a huge plastic bag?? If you want to get the exact same product, I recommend you get All Living Things Fluff N' Snuggle Cotton Nesting Material from Petsmart. It is MUCH cheaper and you actually get more product!! (I got this because I needed a few more dollars to get free shipping). Don't waste your money on this. I am very disappointed.$LABEL$0

What kind of reviews are these???. I wanted an axe that I could not only throw but could also chop trees and trim shooting lanes when I need to. I was to be using it at the deer lease mostly. I chose this one due to its good reviews but honestly the ppl who reviewed it have no idea what their talking about. The cheap metal blade comes sharp and the shipping is extremely fast but the blade bends and breaks with normal wear and tear. It's cheap metal. As far a throwing it is concerned... Don't even bother. I broke 2 of them in less than an hour. The handles are cheaply made and break easily. I've had plastic forks that were more durable. The best use is to mount it over the fire place and hope that all the weight from the dust doesn't break it.$LABEL$0

Gone already. Already lost this unit. The technique to hold it on your belt need serious work because I already lost it walking. It seemed to work ok for the short time I had it but it's a poor design cause it is supposed to measure your walking steps, etc. and it fell off somewhere I was walking. Won't buy another of these.

Superb addition to your Rozz/Christian Death catalog.. The recording is from Rozz's tour of Europe in support of Daucus Karota, and features several recordings that unfortunately Rozz never took into the studio for a potential commercial release. Rozz is emotive and powerful throughout the performance, so it is definately a worthy addition for any fan. The music is more rock-oriented than dark and melancholy. The sound quality slightly pales in comparison to the Triple X Records release, "Iconologia", and the deletion of the Christian Death songs performed during this show is a disappointment. The aforementioned as of yet unreleased tracks more than make-up for the glaring omissions in the recording, so I definately recommend picking this one up!$LABEL$1

It's 1/4th the price of OEM sensor and worked like a charm!. My 2001 Lexus IS300 has four oxygen sensors and so far three of them have been replaced with this Denso sensor model over a period of two years and they are all working perfectly! A Toyota/Lexus performance shop (not a dealership) in Liberty, NC, installed each for the minimum one hour labor charge.

I was interested in buying a Kindle, up until the news today that Amazon remotely deleted books from users Kindles.Quote from Amazon customer service: "The Kindle edition books Animal Farm by George Orwell. Published by MobileReference (mobi) & Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) by George Orwell. Published by MobileReference (mobi) were removed from the Kindle store and are no longer available for purchase. When this occured, your purchases were automatically refunded. You can still locate the books in the Kindle store, but each has a status of not yet available. Although a rarity, publishers can decide to pull their content from the Kindle store."I won't buy this device up until this policy is reversed and I'm assured that the books I buy are actually under my ownership and control without a third party remotely deleting them akin to someone breaking into my house and taking the books from my bookshelf.$LABEL$0

NOT WORTH IT!. I took this back the day after i bought it! It was worthless. It was so hard to get the water in the babies mouth, and even the, the baby would not pee the water out. It just sat in the stomach. How gross is that? Can we say MOLD issues here! It also comes with a very small potty for the baby, and i have seen bigger "more sturdy" ones out there. I am going to buy another one that TALKS and says "mommy, pee-pee" and it is magnetic on the babies back and on the potty, so it only pee's when the baby touches the potty.Seriously, dont waste your 10.00. You will just take it back or upgrade anyways.$LABEL$0
Nice Surprise. I really didn't know what to expect when I started to watch "Book of Lore" but I was pleasantly surprised. Director Chris LaMartina pulls out all of the stops with this intriguing tale of horror that unfolds just like a Stephen King novel. A cast of unknowns turn in credible performances and even though it is low budget, it takes a hold of you and doesn't let go. It was nearly two hours long but it deserved its length. Character and plot development was essential in making it work. If you're a horror buff, don't miss this. The twists and turns are top notch and the collage of music and sound effects are weaved in very nicely. 4 stars. I haven't watched the second feature (Grave Mistake) yet. I'll reveiew it separately.$LABEL$1

Great book.. We've had this about a week and my boy (he's 5) takes it everywhere with him, to read in case there's a slow moment in whatever it is we are doing. I can't tell you what makes it appealing for him, but he understands and retains what he has read, and it carries him way beyond his customary attention span.$LABEL$1
DO NOT BUY. I bought this Hard Drive to back up a older Hard Drive. All I have to say is that this is the biggest waist of money that I have ever spent money on. Fist off the accrual piece of equipment is not bad. It worked for about 30 days then the USB port broke!! I cant use it I even bought eSATA cords and adapter for my computer! second the customer service at Seagate is by far the worst that I have ever dealt with. they have no way of fixing this it is not covered in the warranty and if they were smart obviously they are not they would sell the little adapter that comes of separately so people can buy them. I have read other reviews about the same problem. it seems that this happens more then just once so be warned. Go with a WD or something else.$LABEL$0
PC-Cillin 2007 will slow down your PC/Laptop to a crawl!. Absolutely kills my PC's and laptops (typically a 2.2Ghz CPU with 2GB of RAM) with a process named PcScnSrv.exe alone using over 85% of CPU continually, and 120 MB+ memory, just for this process. Trend Micro PC-Cillin Internet Security 2007 is terrible. I've used PC-Cillin since version 2003, and until this version it has been a good product. Even 2006 was fine. 2007 is a bomb, so do not purchase it or upgrade it. Just delete your registry keys for Trend and reinstall your 2006 version, and you will be better off, until Trend Micro fixes this disastrous problem. I've been working with technical support every day (the "Customer Escalation Team") since 04/05/2007, with no end in sight so far, and it is now 06/04/2007!$LABEL$0
Not for all day wear. I (like many others) use the radios when riding my snowboard.The sound quality can't be faulted, both sending and receiving are crystal clear (and now private). Wearing it all day you can now hear when people are paging you, not just when standing in line.Now the bad; the build quality should be questioned, the speaker inside the earbod rattles around in mine, and the "PTT" button is difficult to press when wearing gloves. The earbud's a little big for my ear, and isn't as comfortable as it could be (although it fits under my helmet fine).The other problem I've had with this is that it pops out of the headphone jack on the radio with annoying regularity. I've solved this with duct tape, which isn't pretty but it is functional....$LABEL$0
Overrated. The entire book could have been distilled down to one or two useful pages. A typical example of the author's predilection to stating the obvious in expert-speak: "Generally children will send discernible non-verbal signals when they are ready to end a conversation with an adult. They often begin to stare off into space or become silly. It is time to end the exchange."And then there are the self-promoting anecdotes such as, "It is encouraging to meet alumni from the 90's who had been exposed to intense social skill instruction during their high school years. Their conversational entrees are far more appropriate and effective: 'How are Mrs. Lavoie, Christian, Danny and Meggi?' 'How long will you be in the area?' 'How are things on Cape Cod?'"If you can bring yourself to wade through the superfluous chit chat and you've never read anything on this subject before, it may be worth buying used.$LABEL$0
A classic performance. I have owned and enjoyed the VHS format of this performance for several years. I gladly would have replaced it with the DVD, but I understand there are no subtitles. That is truly inexcusable since they are there in the VHS. Nevertheless, the performance is grand in every sense of the word. The death scene as done by Nesterenko is absolutely breathtaking. I actually prefer the Mussorgsky version (Kirov/Gergiev) for many reasons, but I am still very happy to own this one.$LABEL$1
Typical Washington. The book starts out OK--and some of the concepts are impressive considering it was written in a pre 9/11 world. Then it seems like the author runs out of things to say and the tone of the book shifts. The second half reads more like a memoir and its purpose is to name drop. Yawn!$LABEL$0

Carter deminished. Carter's book brings to mind of how can you trust his judgement? During his presidency, he sent some brave men on a suicide mission to rescue the hostages. The equipment they were given was not designed to be used over a desert climate. Some of the men paid with their lives, but Carter lives on. If these men had reached Tehran, what were they going to do, knock on doors? I get the impression that his innocent smile is lethal.$LABEL$0

Softer then expected, but still good.. Significant Other was good, but I expected it to be better. Three Dollar Bill (The first album), was a hard hitting album that rocked all the way through. This one still rocks, but it seems like it gets softer in the middle of the songs, especially during the chorus. However Significant Other is a much deeper and much better written album then the first. Excellent tracks on this CD are "Just Like This", "N 2 Gether Now", "Show Me What You Got", "No Sex", and of course the smash hit, "Nookie".$LABEL$1
Terribly converted e-book format. I couldn't get past the first 5 chapters in this book due to the number of typos and poor translation. As soon as I'd begin to be immersed in the story a string of typos would trip me up and frustrate me. Often times I'd find myself re-reading a paragraph more than once to try and figure out what was being said because of the bad translation. This is certainly not a Wordsworth e-book conversion! You're better off just buying the book instead of this.$LABEL$0
A Must Have For Your Property With Large Trees. I enjoy gardening and try to do everything myself. I have a Acre of land with alot of mature trees and was never able to prune the lower 15-20 feet. Every 2 years I had to hire someone at a cost of several hundred dollars. No more, the Pruning Stick does a beautiful job. Its very well built and it cuts like butter. I love it. Now I'm able to do it myself and prune all the trees the exact length I want.I must add I have not tried the saw included with the Pruning Stick since I also purchased American Gardeners Yardsaw, but have not used it yet.$LABEL$1

Good, but not good enough. Liner fits bathtub niceline and is easy to inflate. Colorful and does the job but can only be used if your baby is a "sitter" in the tub and doesn't try to pull up on the tub sides as the cushion doesn't go all the way to the top, much less over the top of the tub at all. Would be so much better if it extended up a little over the top of the tub wall.Also, suction cups are large but don't hold to the rounded corners of the tub at all, so comes off and floats up during every bath. Not using it anymore...$LABEL$0

Fun disco music. Music can be serious, but it doesn't have to be serious all the time. Baccara, with their European accents, their sexy voices and their lightweight songs, made disco music that was never meant to be taken seriously. Their music was pure fun, and never meant to be anything else. If anybody doubted that, listen to their cover of Yummy yummy yummy. It was a silly song when first recorded by the Ohio Express in the sixties and sounds every bit as silly by Baccara, but it suits them.Baccara topped the British charts in the late seventies with Yes sir I can boogie. The follow-up, Sorry I'm a lady, provided them with a top ten hit. These are the best tracks here, though The devil sent you to Laredo, Parles-vous Francais and their covers of La bamba and Can't help falling in love are also wonderful.Baccara did not make music that could be called essential, but they had a style all their own that provides a refreshing change from more serious music.$LABEL$1

Disappointed. I doubt if I will use this product very much. I ordered this money clip/credit card clip with the thought that it would eliminate the need to carry a wallet on certain occasions. I was very disappointed with this product.First of all, the clip is bulky and the corners of the watch are sharp. When I reach into my pocket to get the clip out, I stab my fingers with the corners of the watch. Also, you must carry a minimum of five credit cards or they will slide out of the holder that they fit in. I have had a couple of money clip watches in the past and have been very satisfied with them. I am very disappointed with this product.$LABEL$0
Shotgun Bride. From the back cover:BACKWOODS BEAUTYHallie Benteen would never have guessed that the man who lay beside her was Ritter Sloane -- Wyoming's most notorioius gunslinger...HANDSOME HELLIONHe'd come to throw the Benteen family off their land, Instead, he saved Hallie's life...SHOTGUN BRIDECarrying her from an icy snowdrift to the warmth of her bed, he revived her the only practical way: body heat. And for that he awoke to the cold metal of a shotgun and an ultimatum by Hallie's three strapping brothers: marry her or else! Now a marriage hardly made in heaven took off in a blaze of clashing desires ... where the simple words "I do" sparked a tumultuous passion -- an untamed love as wild and hungry as their own tempestuous hearts!My Review:I loved this book. It was very fast paced and entertaining. The Benteen family was a hoot! I'm gonna have to look for the sequel Runaway Bride now.$LABEL$1

Good ride. I just purchased a Revmaster to spin at home and looked at all the DVD's out there to use, and chose this one and another one. I am so glad I did. I love the options of intervals, hills, flat roads, and the option of picking and choosing which ride you want to put together, and the option of the intensity. Mindy is very precise in her explanation of what she is doing and offers you choices. Very knowledgeable instructor. One minor detail, and please forgive me for the negative comment, but she does talk a lot, sometimes good, sometimes not. Other than that, I love it and never get bored because it offers so many mix and match options.$LABEL$1
Waste of $20 - get the Krups. My Braun died after a few years of good service. I went with Mr Coffee, but will get a Krups after just a couple of weeks. Not worth the effort to return it so I will eat the $20. This is why I dislike it: the green leds do not shutoff, you have to unplug it; after you grind the coffee and try to empty it, a lot is left stuck on the bottom; the 'grind' button sometimes sticks, and you think it is broken; it is taller than my old Braun and is somewhat unwieldy. Don't need any issues with a grinder, just want it to be quick and easy.$LABEL$0
The worst movie I've ever seen. I think that it was obvious by the trailers alone that this was going to be a horrible movie anyway, and that's why I didn't bother going to the theaters to see it like most of my friends. I waited until it was on HBO, and I have to say that it was the most painful 80 minutes I've ever spent in front of a television screen. The entire cast is absolutely horrible, once again proving that as long as you have a pretty face you don't need to have a teaspoon's worth of talent to be in the movies. The movie follows the "She's All That" format pretty closely, and every time it tries to go into another movie it only confuses the viewer more. My advice? Go to the dentist and ask to have four of your teeth drilled at once. Even that is better than sitting through this pile of garbage.$LABEL$0

Really?. A one-star review. Really? Have you never seen "Casper (the friendly ghost)?" That's a one-star movie. Maybe you sort of have to know a little bit more about music than what you can glean from your programmed-from-audience-response radio playlist. I can't rave about this movie enough. This is music & theatre mixed at its optimal proportions. Great script. Great acting. Great directing and editing. Thirty-five years hence it is still relevant. Please, take my word...$LABEL$1
Brilliant. All the favorable reviews here below say it all, so I'll just comment on the language McCarthy uses. The author's apparent flouting of the normal rules of grammar in favor of stark, harrowing rhythm works beautifully. Also, he uses all those wonderfully precise words we somehow almost forgot - skifts and catamites, gimbals and gambrels, stoven faces and balefires .... A bleak, beautiful read.$LABEL$1

Great Bag for Even the Biggest Set of Jumper Cables!!!!!. After my other set of Jumper Cables went out. I bought the biggest set I could find, 20 Foot 2-Gauge Professional Jumper Cables and these aren't CHEAP!!! I started to look for a Bag to store these in, so I could keep them nice and like new. I found this one on Amazon and got it in. Just Roll the Cables up, good and tight and had no problem putting them in. Bag is sturdy enough to keep them like new for many years to come.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BAG!!!!!!!!!!$LABEL$1
How to read this book. I would just like to respond to Flavio's review. As a physicist, I drew the same kinds of mathematical conclusions he did when he read the book. I do not, however, feel that this is the point. Whether 9 comes out in the decimal system or 7 comes out in the octal system is irrelevant. "No 9" remains a beautifully written piece of literature that expresses author's fascination with numbers and geometry. Sure, you can find rigourous mathematical proofs why '9' must come out. I have worked it out myself, and I don't disagree. However, there are many scientific phenomena (rainbows, fractals etc.) that are no less beautiful despite being taken apart, analysed, and understood.Number 9 is a captivating, well written and beautiful book that was a pleasure to read. The reader is drawn in by the author's fascination with the subject, and kept there by the author's storytelling skill.I recommend it.$LABEL$1
ankle brace. This brace has inflated pads to make it more comfortable. Unfortunately, they are glued to the hard plastic sides with a flexible adhesive, so they shift after you apply them. This can result in an uncomfortable fit. After I taped the pads in place with adhesive tape, the braces worked better and were more comfortable. I had a hard time applying this brace by myself because I also had a fractured clavicle--think I would have had trouble with any brace. When my wife helped me apply it, it was tight enough and provided good support.$LABEL$0
Great Price. Amazon.com is great enough as it is. But where else could you find BluRay movies for $9.99 especially when it just came out. Item came in fast. This is a must for Disney collectors. I am about to order Monsters Inc and UP for $30. Have fun and keep shopping.$LABEL$1

Worth the wait. Possibly the most comprehensive Phish album to date. While it lacks some of the improvisational flare of Lawn Boy and Junta, it ranks right up there in my book. The band's side projects prove to be influential, as jazz and funk undertones drive the album. Pick this one up for sure.$LABEL$1
Car Seat Base Does NOT Work. The design of the car seat base is very defective. There is no possible way to get it tight enough. I could pull on the front of the base with one finger and flip it right out of the LATCH belt (that was pulled as tight as humanly possible). In addition, the car seat carrier was difficult to secure on the base and difficult to get off, losening the belt even further with each attempt. I returned it for the Graco Oakwood and could not believe how complicated and unsafe this Eddie Bauer Travel System is in comparison. Two thumbs way down!!!$LABEL$0

My personal album of the year.. Scarling is the first band to come out in the past few years that I've had any interest in at all. Most (not all, but most) of the stuff I listen to is ten, fifteen years older or more. Yet they've put out two amazing albums in a relatively short period of time that left a lasting impression on me. So Long, Scarecrow is a particularly emotional piece of work, the first full length album I've heard this year that made me feel something more than ambivalence (needless to say, I've been disappointed by some of the recent works of some of my all-time favorite artists). This heralds a complete departure from Jessicka's Jack Off Jill roots, where remnants of them could still be heard and felt in Sweet Heart Dealer. I would definetly say that this album has bumped Scarling up to my new favorite band.$LABEL$1
The tape doesn't follow the book. After reading through the book, then listening to the tape I found myself very confused. The tape starts out following the layout of the book, but quickly starts moving around to different sections (some even on other pages) and then returning without any warning. I had to have a native speaker assist me in figuring out where the tape was reading from, and make marks in the book. I also felt this went to fast, and didn't cover basics such as syntax. This book also jumps into full dialogue much too fast, and doesn't give proper instruction. This is my first attempt at learning Vietnamese, and if I didn't have a native speaker to help me I would probably give up after trying this book.$LABEL$0

I bought this as a gift for a family member because it was ranked 4/5 stars at the time, with very little complaints for a descent price too! But like the saying goes you get what you pay for.

My thoughts on "A Twist of Fate". With the metric tons of garbage released under the guise of rock, it's a crime that John Arch doesn't release more brilliant material like this to counteract it. I guess we should just be thankful that we have this 2-song EP at all, but it leaves you wanting more of Arch's amazing vocals. The winner on this EP is Relentless, one of the best progressive rock songs these ears have heard in quite some time. Between Jim Matheos on guitar here and Ray Alder in Redemption'sSnowfall on Judgement Day, it's both a shame and a blessing that Fates Warning had to break up to give us great music elsewhere.$LABEL$1
Stagnant water. I thought this would be a series of compositions that conjured up images of the Amazon.

Not this time!$LABEL$0
The Greatest Country-Rock Album Ever. The Gram Parsons-led Byrds was a much different outfit than the original group, which is still my favorite incarnation of the Byrds. However (with a boldfaced, 32-point capital "H"), this album is quite simply fantastic in its own right. It is quite simply the best country-rock album ever made, in my opinion, and that is saying a lot. From the opening strains of Dylan's "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere," you know you're in for a great treat. No ringing electric 12-string Rickenbackers, just timeless country harmonies sung with great vision and enthusiasm.$LABEL$1

Ayurveda Dumbed Down. I purchased this book on the strength of other consumer's reviews, but was disappointed by how simplistic it is. Ayurvedic medicine is a life-long study, not a "handbook" for looking up routine symptoms. It may be an introduction to this ancient form of healing, but the book really can't help anyone get an over-all picture of their state of health, or give good advice on how to treat yourself. This book is just an example of the Western approach: why see a real, trained practitioner when you can save money and fix yourself? Only you can't--at least not with this book. Save your money and go see an Ayurvedic Physician and be properly diagnosed and treated.$LABEL$0
Great game. Got this game for Christmas and haven't stopped playing it. Nice game to play after a hard day at work.

I also agree that it is too short but I still feel it has good replay value.$LABEL$1
A nice and brief social commentary. I'm a big fan of other Sicilian novels, especially Lampedusa's the Leopard and Riotta's Prince of the Clouds. The island's tragic history produces a rich backdrop for painting a nuanced set of characters and emotions.Sciascia's short novel is wholly Sicilian, centering around his anti-mafia frustrations. The characters are nicely sketched and the writing is brief and exciting. It's a short book that reads quickly and lively.I appreciated the story and its quick moving plot. It's a good book and the introduction is helpful for understanding it's context. At the end of the day, the work is more commentary on Sciascia's times than it is a complex wrought novel. I'm glad I read it, but I didn't find it as fulfilling as I thought I might. Look to the Leopard or the Prince of Clouds if you're looking for a full fledged novel. Otherwise, you'll be very pleased with this nice work.$LABEL$1

Gomer Pile U.S.M.C Complete Series. I cant say enough good things about Gomer Pile, the entire family will enjoy this series, there should be more TV series like this one on television for everyone to enjoy, but they don't make-em like they used to , i enjoyed this series as a child, and i am enjoying it all over again now, i am just thrilled that they have it out on DVD, so that future generations, can discover it, and enjoy it as much as i do, in each episode Gomer Pile is teaching valuable lessons, like being kind to animals, and always telling the truth, and being kind to everyone, also it is filled with good clean humor, i laugh out loud in every episode, you will just have to get this series yourself to truly see how great it is, once you start watching you cant stop, my advice is that if you do not have this series , Buy it , you won't regret it!!!$LABEL$1
Comfortable & sounds great. My husband & I game side by side on different TV's, but that means only one person can have the sound on at a time or it is too confusing. However, normal headphones don't allow me to hear hubbie or kids talking, so I've been searching for one like this that would let me hear my game AND hear my people. Works great! You can wear the headset on either ear. You'll need an adapter and a longer cord to reach your system, though.$LABEL$1
young Immature male humor. I expected this film to have some raw moments after seeing the cast, but after 30min I knew that my entire experience was going to be redundant sexual humor that never seemed to take a break even long enough to develop any sense of a story. Though well acted and clever in some approaches, the screen play and directing lacked any maturity. Its fun to laugh at raw slapstick jokes, but not when the joke is re-told a dozen times!$LABEL$0

X2 Rocks!. The first X-Men set not only set the stage for more movies, it gave the genral public a nice glimpse of Stan Lee's Mutants.X2 pushes the limits when it comes to screenplay, special effects and storyline.Nightcrawler is a VERY welcome character. And they do a wonderful job of using him throughout the entire movie. The opening scene is perhaps one of the coolest in film of late.Can't wait till X3!!!$LABEL$1
White on Rice. If you are looking for a different sound from whats played on the radio then this is it. If you are like me and listen to different styles from classical to rock (a wide range of music) this artist blends them together like white on rice. A great display of talent shown by a one man band. I recomend this his music to all-those people who like to kick back and chill. Layed back music with a good twist.$LABEL$1

Cheapo Alarm Clock!. This alarm clock had all of the features that I needed: large LCD, auto-set, dual alarms. However, the build quality and instruction manual are terrible.First, to turn off the alarm, there is a small "Off" button the far right of the top. However, half of the time, the alarm treats this as a snooze, so 10 minutes later, the alarm goes off again. This is really annoying if you actually get up when the alarm goes off and aren't just hitting the snooze button.Second, the alarm has a nap function that will make the alarm go off in 15, 30, or etc. minutes. In order to turn off the nap function after you have set it (say you set it for 30 minutes, but you woke up after 20), the manual says to hold down the off or hold down the nap button. But this doesn't work.All in all, I won't ever buy an RCA clock again.$LABEL$0
Not Much Help. The first time I saw VID 6 was at the customer's site. I huried to the bookstore and bought the only book written on VID 6. It was like throwing a drowning man an anchor! Between this book, the MSDN Library CD, and Microsoft's ever-so-helpful online documentation, I got most of my answers from trial and error. The book is repetative and does not touch on any technical issues. It is also a very poor reference book.$LABEL$0
Five Stars so far.... I'm only through the first eight chapters (I've been reading it while traveling back and forth for the holidays), but so far I'm really pleased with this book. I like all the FAQ and review stuff at the end of each chapter, this really helps to remember the most important stuff in each section. IFthe last couple chapers let me down, I'll update my review, but based on what I've read I'd be surpriesed by that.$LABEL$1
A Skip and a Dash in the Dark. I had such high hopes for a book that got to the heart of my favorite city and my favorite literature. However, first it dismayed, then depressed, then just made me plain angry that Ms. Quindlen could be so superficial, so full of cliches, have such shallow skills of description and so absolutely little insight into either London or literature. Surely someone soon will pick up the inky scratches and try again.$LABEL$0

DEFINITELY, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. This CD is light years in distant (remote) listening quality and technique when compared to Joe's other CD. I could not believe this was the same guy playing on the CD "A Good Cup of Joe". Don't waste your money on this one.$LABEL$0
Great sound, but be gentle with the wires!. I've used these for 3 years of daily train commuting, and they isolate the outside sound fairly well. My only major complaint is that, despite carefully winding them in the supplied case each day, the wires eventually frayed near the earbuds. I had the same issue with earlier Sony earbuds, and I thought the thicker gauge wires of the Shure would help.On the plus side, Shure honored the 2-year warranty and promptly sent me a brand-new replacement. But now, barely a year later, the cord is fraying again on both sides, the signal is dropping out, and I've finally decided to order a pair ofEtymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones (Black), since I've had a lot of success with their musician's earplugs. Their wires look delicate too, so I think I'll pre-emptively wrap them with some electrical tape near the bud end, a precaution that might be advised with these Shure models as well.Bottom line, I loved the e2cs, but it's time to move on. YMMV...$LABEL$1
Battery life. This battery seems to last forever. Other batteries I have had in the past never had the same life time. I was always in the middle of an important short and would have to change batteries. It also doesn't take as long as others to recharge this battery.$LABEL$1
Comfortable, Affordable, and Easy to Use BT Headset. I use this headset with a V3 Razr and have been very pleased with the performance. I've worn the headset for an hour at times and it's not a problem having it on. The sound quality is very good although there is some ocassional static on my end. This is my first BT headset, so I think the static is probably a consequence of the BT connection rather than the headset itself. The people I have called tell me that the headset actually sounds better than talking into my old Motorola V265 phone. Overall, the headset fits well, is easy to set up and use, and provides very good sound quality. For the price, this headset is a good value that's going to be hard to beat. I would definitely recommend it.$LABEL$1
Please read this if you're an Xbox 360 user. This drive is terribly unreliable. It failed the initial test to begin using it as Xbox 360 storage (which should have been my first clue) but eventually was accepted by the Xbox and I started six hours worth of Battlefield DLC downloading. Halfway through, the USB drive lost data and had to be reinitialized by the Xbox (which should have been my second clue) so I started the downloads again. Worked okay, then after the console shut down and started back up the USB drive had to be reinitialized by the Xbox. Now this drive is in the trash, where it belongs. Too bad, it's a nice looking USB drive and the price was great for the capacity -- but it's just no good.$LABEL$0
The Laserdisc is so much better, since it has the whole show. My long time waiting for a DVD version of that old but great Laserdisc was wasted. It's absolutely depressing what they did here, by cutting some of the best parts of the original show.The Queen Medley by the great band Extreme was probably the best part of this show, not only because the way they played, but also because the playlist choice. A Medley of Bohemian Rhapsody, Bycicle Race, Another One Bites Dust, Keep Yourselves Alive, and others leading to one of the most beautiful moments of the show: the Radio Ga Ga ending, leading the audience to tears.Although the sound has been improved and a new and useless "extra materials" has been added, it doesn't worth the content they cut (opening act, Metallica, Def Leppard, GnR, Extreme and others).I would never exchange the old original laserdisc for this useles "extra materials" with a bunch of new footage.$LABEL$0
A Study of Six Statesmen. I enjoyed this book immensely. Each of the six contributed differently. George Kennan, a foreign service officer and then scholar, was the most cerebral and prescient. Dean Acheson was the most arrogant. Robert Lovett had the best sense of humor which served him well in dealing with Congress and others endowed with super egos. Averell Harriman was the wealthiest and the most tenacious. John McCloy was the most accomplished. Charles (Chip) Bohlen was a foreign service officer with distinguished longevity.These individuals were great statesmen. Except for Kennan, at first they were all in favor of US involvement in the Vietnam War. Even very accomplished statesmen misgauged Vietnam.I highly recommend this book despite its length. It is one of my favorite books.$LABEL$1
ho hum. This product should be as much fun as being backstage at Miss America but it turns out to be as boring as being in the audience. It is recorded as if we are interested in the selection of cheerleaders as opposed to the cheerleaders themselves.$LABEL$0

The wonderful world of gloomcookie. I absolutely love gloomcookie! From the moment I accidently discovered the first book in a cartoon shop I was captivated. And although the artwork in the second volume is not as smashing as in the first, the story is so wonderfully fascinating and addictive it does not really matter much. The complexity AND simplicity of it is incredible.Highly recommended!$LABEL$1
Bad narration on CD version. It's hard to believe that Peter Riegert has never met a Filipino, or that he couldn't at least have done some research. His "Filipinos" talk like Chinamen from old Charlie Chan films and sometimes lapse into what Riegert calls "TAG-a-log." Is this the work of a professional?$LABEL$0
My First and Last Elizabeth Berg Novel - Read Why. This novel confused me. (I would give it 1-1/2 stars if possible.) The subject matter is decidedly adult (divorce affairs, near affairs), but the writing seems more appropriate for someone in the age range of maybe an 11 to 14 year old girl. In fact, I even looked it up to see if I accidentally selected a book meant for young readers. Both the husband and the wife are so incredibly childish acting, the story seemed infantile and unrealistic. All the scenes with the husband playing a shopping mall Santa were unnecessary and, frankly, rather stupid. I love quirky characters, but these characters were just kind of foolish. The only person halfway plausible and interesting was the young daughter. After this taste of Berg's writing, I will not sample another.$LABEL$0
Quick read. Love Langston Hughes' poetry, but this was a nice departure. I would recommend this book to any young person who has not read anything by Langston.$LABEL$1

Good Read. Being a Demonologist and working with "possessed" or claimed to be. I find this book well writen and investigating demonic cases are not an easy task to deal with. It is rare that a person will in fact become "possessed" by demons, but in my own work I have found that in a lot of cases it is in fact some form of mental illness with the person and not a demonic attack. In any case this book does make for a good read anyways.Katie BoydAuthor of Devils & Demonology In the 21st Century$LABEL$1

This is just sad.. Loved the books, loved the movies, LOVED the extended editions. What a waste this release is.

Good for an old diamond!. King Diamond does a great job here, which remembers those days of "Them", "The Eye", "Abigail" and "Conspiracy". However, the aforementioned albums are better than this one. Are the King's resources exhausted? Not at all, but this album, while very good, shows how hard is to keep writing original music after many years of innovation. Simply, there is nothing new to say in spite of this marvelous horror tale, the powerful sound, the great production and the very professional musicianship of the band (particularly Andy LaRocque sounds great here, not mentioning Diamond's vocals and the superb rhythmic baseline). In few words, a very solid work from one of the few classic bands that still are sailing over there with honor. You won't be disappointed: a great and soulful return to the roots, without hiding how many years we already have on our backs. Great job, evil creature!$LABEL$1
"Surprises" were too obvious, Character uninteresting. I downloaded this book for MS Reader without knowing anything about the author. Although the premise of the book seemed somewhat intriguing at first, I got tired of the author trying to "surprise" me with events that were so obvious that a kid would have seen them coming. With few exceptions, the characters were not given enough "character" to make them interesting in the least. I can't believe that this is supposed to be a best-selling author. I suppose on some levels this book could be interesting (such as the descriptions of Miami), but for me it was plain boredom.$LABEL$0

Get what you pay for. I would suggest spending a few more bucks for better quality earphones. First and foremost, these do not fit very comfortably in the ear and do not come with multiple ear buds. The sound quality is far inferior to $10 Skullcandy Earbuds I previously owned which also had a volume control switch on them. For the price I could not expect too much, but next time I will definitely pay a little extra money for a better quality product$LABEL$0
Great info on national account management.. An excellent book on national account management that emphasizes 'customer delight' as a primary sales goal. I like how the author covers the foundations and then moves through planning to implementing the account plan. Lots of charts, tools, and minicases clearly illustrate the concepts. A must-read for the sales professional!$LABEL$1
feels like he's writing for young adults. This is my second book by Paulo Coelho. I first read the Alchemist and I bought this book before I realized it was the same author. Based on reading these two books, I have to say that this guy writes as though his audience is young adults. The writing is flat and simplistic. If you like reading YA books, then you might like this. Otherwise, don't bother.$LABEL$0
Glad my husband bugged me to read this book!. My husband kept telling me to read this book but I thought "No way, boring, no impact that concerns me." But, there it was and I read it and I'm very glad I did. This book was short, informative and far from boring! I'm now able to discuss this intelligently and make informed decisions.$LABEL$1

The comedy does not mix with the drama. In "The Wood" "Get On The Bus" and "Soul Food" the filmmakers was able to balance the comedy with the drama but in "Kingdom Come" nuthin works...One second there is a dramatic reminiscing about the death of an unborn child and in the next Jada Pinkett starts screaming and tries to be funny (which she definitly is not)...I like Jada Pinket in "Set It Off" and in "Jason's Lyric" but u find yourself wanting to strangle her character in this movie...Not even LL COOL J, Vivica A Fox or Whoopie Goldberg can save this movie from being a disaster...When making this movie they should have chosen either to make a comedy or a drama.The movie is kind of like a 90 minute commercial for the church mixed with Drama and strangled comedy.$LABEL$0

I wanna be sugar free. I learned a lot from this book. It emphasized eating no sugar products. It is hard to be completely sugar free. Even if you are buying organic products you still have to read every label. Sugar is sugar, organic or not. The kids react either way. I try to keep my kids off as much sugar as possible. I can tell when they have it because they are more hyper and ready to fight and argue.This book gave me some good ideas. I now have an easier time. And someday I want to be completely sugar free with my family.$LABEL$1
Acoustic Mope Rock. This CD of Luka, his guitar, and some of the most depressing songs around is just too musically repetitive. One song sounds so like the next that it is tough to distinguish one from another, regardless of the topic. While lyrically challenging, the lack of variation in sound defeated me and this one will rarely get another spin.$LABEL$0
OK design, poor materials. I like the design of this grater: it doesn't take up much space and is easy to clean because it comes apart. Unfortunately, the white plastic broke in several places after only a few months of use.$LABEL$0
Good, until it breaks. Well, it worked very well while it lasted. I used it only at my work PC, so I barely retract it. Works well tho. After about 8 months, the connector can no longer keep a stable connection. One wiggle and it'll disconnect, and if you're unlucky, like me, it will corrupt your music/video and everything will disappear. To fix this, you'll need to SSH in and delete the iTunes_Control (which had all my unrecognizable music) and re-sync.$LABEL$0
Very general video - Doesn't cover all the questions. I was disappointed in this video because it didn't cover a lot of the questions I have about soldering - how to keep my tip clean (use of sponge, use of a sal ammonic block), how to tin my tip, etc. Instead, Payne just covers the act of soldering. She also moves very quickly and doesn't always explain what she means, which makes it a little confusing. I was looking for a a video course in copper-foil soldering and this did not really explain to me how to correct the issues I'm having with my own soldering. While it was helfpul to see someone in the act of soldering, I didn't get $30 worth of advice from the video.$LABEL$0
nice. My 18 month old loves the Signing Time series, she knows many signs thanks to these dvd's. Move and Groove shows kids how to sign walk, jump, dance, etc and puts it all together in a fun song.

Trouble in paradise for Toni & Alex. Their May/ July (not really December) affair is in trouble due to another woman putting the moves on Alex without him really reciprocating. Meanwhile, Col. Howard's son Tyrone meets a nice girl to help him get over vain beauty Bella. But can he really get over her? One humorous note, though. The new girl has this strange stopwatch. No batteries, no solar power. Would you believe it has a SPRING and you actually WIND it! Otherwise, VR whiz Jay Gridley is after this hacker and the guy sends him a mild stroke online. Which knocks him out of the box, and if too many people take this part of the story too seriously, it might start a Luddist phobia against VR that will more than counter the bunch who've made a secular religion out of gizmos. That would be a shame--what about those of us who aren't computer enthusiasts but find the gear...er um...useful?$LABEL$1
Soft and Silky. I just rec'd and washed the white set ordered 5 sets b1g1 free deal burgundy,silver blue, white, heather (lilac) and green.When I rec'd them they were so light feeling and when I saw 60/40 cotton /polyester mix I thought oh no ! But after I washed and put them on the bed. I was impressed they feel so silky soft very deep pockets. While I am not crazy about polyester It will proably ad to the duribility of the sheets.

very good, but could be better. The message of this book is wonderful, challenging, even life-changing. However, I felt that instead of using so much dialog to teach and preach, that the book could have used more action. I think that in real life no one could listen to all that Li Quan had to say and still stick around to be his friend like Ben Fielding did. I'm thankful for this book and how it made me think about my priorities and how superficial we can be with our faith compared to Christians who are being persecuted.$LABEL$1

Both Dogs Love These!. Ok, best dog bed ever. Both of my dogs are obsessed with these. I've bought several other beds and my dogs never use these. My pups are a Golden (14 months) and an Aussie (9 months) and we've never had issues with chewing, popping, or anything. They DO get stained easily with nasty dog stains (dirt, drool, and the like all stain the bed), but these are tucked away in our bedroom just for bedtime, so we don't care how they look.$LABEL$1
Phone gets VERY HOT !. I got this phone on July 2, 2004. I charged the battery and after two days of not using the phone, the battery was dead. I recharged the battery several times and the it keeps dying even though I don't use it.I went back to COSTCO and I was given a new battery. The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT! If I call my mom and am on the phone for 20 minutes, it is UNCONFORTABLY HOT and am unable to continue conversing.My guess is that this phone is good for emergency calls but not as your only phone. Furthermore, the guy at COSTCO told me that the phone is not designed for long periods of talk time. I asked what was the phone for?Anyway, am going back next week and have them exchange it for another one. If that one gets hot too, then I may just consider cancelling my contract and getting my money back. I have never had a cell phone that got so uncomfortably Hot.$LABEL$0
Another great Ga'hoole book. My son and I have really enjoyed the whole Guardians of Ga'hoole series. This book is no exception. The story is well written and holds your attention quite well. We have read all of the series at bedtime and 3-4 chapters a night never seems like enough. We both always want more.This story explains a lot of things mentioned in the other books. It was nice to see the background behind those books. Now we are anxiously awaiting the next addition to this wonderful series.$LABEL$1

People tell me that they get a nostalgic feeling while listening to this, but I don't see it.

A Journey Back Home. Garrison Keillor delivers yet another home run with his trip down memory lane to fictional Lake Wobegon. Chock full of boyhood angst, baseball, religion, flatulence jokes and sexual fixation, Keillor elicits memories from his flock of loyal readers and creates a pseudo-memoir that stirs echoes of Bill Bryson's Life & Times of the Thunderbolt Kid and David James Duncan's The Brothers K. High praise for this author and much deserved. If you're a man (especially one who grew up pecking away at his own Underwood) between the ages of 30 and 60, Lake Wobegon Summer 1956 is a 'must read'. I can't recommend it enough.Salmon Run$LABEL$1
great story. really nice story to help children understand that divorce is not their fault, which is an almost-inevitable conclusion most kids under the age of 8 will draw. family in the story is obviously a middle class caucasian family having a pretty amicable divorce: families where there has been violence or more argument in front of the kids would want to add some sentences here and there. for example, "remember when mommy and daddy used to yell/hit/argue all the time? that was scary, wasn't it? we didn't want to scare you, so we decided we were better as friends than as husband and wife. i know it is hard to go from house to house, but now it is not scary and we both love you very much." that sort of thing.$LABEL$1

poor copy. I have two reviews for this movie. the first is the film itself and the second is on the actually copy.This movie is a great Kung fu classic. The title I am more familiar with is "Return to the 36th chamber" aka "Return of the Master Killer"36 chambers usually refers to the first one. Aka "the master killer of Shaolin. or just "master killer"That being said I do really like this movie and feel that everyone should own it... just not this copy.Now for the copy being sold here...the image is so poor it is difficult to watch. it is very grainy the color is off and the cropping is horrible.My recomedation for anyone really into classic kung fu movies is to pick up a region free player and buy the Hong Kong remastered versions by Celestial released by Intercontinental Video Limitedor Deltamac$LABEL$0
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!. It's a shame that more people out there cannot be graced by the musical presence of Amel Larrieux just because she is not on the top ten lists nor make appearances on MTV. Nevertheless, she is a gem, soulfully bombarding her listener with a concordance of musical honesty. Her voice is airy in its delivery, she literally breathes into every song. Talent such as hers makes me upset that artists such as Britney Spears can be idolized, yet REAL voice talent such as Ms. Larrieux's can be ignored. This is one of the best albums of 2004. Highly recommended if you are a fan of the likes of India Arie., Jill Scott or Sade.$LABEL$1

A Collector's Find. I'm a serious collector of movies. Not only does this collection contain movies not available before on DVD, it also contains many cartoons and short subjects which were not previously available on DVD. I highly recommend this collection.$LABEL$1
Not sure about the authenticty...... The seller sent the items very quickly. The only doubt I have is that all the blades I've bought have blue aloe above and below the blades. These have green above and blue below. I've heard there are copies of the blades going around. Could this be the case? They seem to work fine though and I don't want to impugn the seller's character since I'm really not sure!$LABEL$1
It's like listening to a tv evangelist. I read this book BEFORE 'The Bible Code'and it made me want to read the original.This is the only book I ever threw in the garbage the second I read the last word. I don't need to be preached to at my age. This guy is just another big mouth preaching about God and the bible. All Stanton knows how to say is 'they left out the vowels'-give me a break. I will be reading The Bible Code soon. It may be another Chariot of the Gods but I bet it won't preach to me. Save your money.$LABEL$0
Best tasting lo-cal cat treat!. We have a cat on steroids due to a medical condition. We have to count every calorie for her. Her diet is very limited, so treats are important to her. We've spent a fortune trying every lo-cal treat. Either cats don't like them, or they're not really lo-cal enough.A trim Treat is 0.8 calories ... break 4 of them in 1/2 & your cat gets 8 little treats for ~ 3 calories. (Roughly the same a 1 piece of other lo-cal treats.)We have 4 cats. 3 out of 4 love Trim Treats. Even those that are not on diets. (Except Jessicat ... she hates everything that is not filet mignon or shrimp. She's the "Mikey" of the cat world)Trim Treats are a great find. My cats highly recommend them!$LABEL$1

WHY TITS??? WHY??. I really like some albuns by TITS like Tudo ao mesmo tempo agora and TITANOMAQUIA...But what tits became in the late 90's makes me sad...They were a punk rock metal band and after the acoustic MTV they totally sell out their sound!!! Why, Tits??? WHY?$LABEL$0
It's Only Missing God. God is almost completely absent from this film, which, you'll have to admit is pretty weird. There were also two or three really uncomfortable sex scenes. No nudity, but still painfully uncomfortable to watch with the family. One especially where her husband threw her on the bed then pushed her head aside and said "Don't look at me."The acting, writing, directing were Ok, but when you see a christian film, you hope to see something that focuses on God.Definately recommend you skip this one.$LABEL$0
Read before ordering this CD. For others who love slots and video poker as much as I do, please note that this product ONLY has 3 games on it - 2 slot machines and 1 video poker machine. I was wondering why it only took about 30 seconds to install! I have purchased casino software that has cost as little as [price] and it STILL had much more of a gaming selection on it. This software has more film clips pushing travel to Vegas than it does the actual games themselves. Do yourself a favor - order something else.$LABEL$0

Low Reading Level. The reading level of Watership Down was unbelievingly low, so low that it could be described as shocking. For lovers of middle school fictions, bunnies may excite you. Though mature and readers searching for a more challenging read should find some other novel to try on.$LABEL$0
oh no, what's happened to him?. When I started reading Allan Folsom's THE EXILE, I couldn't put it down...when I did (after reading it in two marathon sessions) I ran out and purchased (not at Amazon but at full retail price) THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW and THE CONFESSION.I was amazed by his intricate plotting, the continued surprise twists, the breakneck pacing. Here was an author who was a clear master of the genre - imaginative, facile, talented.Sadly, The Machiavelli Covenant was disappointing. I kept waiting for it to take off, and it never did. I was 200 pages into it and I asked myself "When is this going to start" It was interesting, but didn't generate the excitment his other books did.I will definately read his next book when it comes out, I'm just not salivating for its pub date.$LABEL$0
Nothing like Hair One or Wen. I bought this because the bottle said it was a "conditioning shampoo". This is nothing like Hair One or Wen. This lathers like a regular shampoo and I did not like the way it made my hair feel; like a dried mass when wet.I suppose if you had oily hair, this may work for you. I just want to caution people from spending their hard-earned money on something that is not what it appears to be. (Also, someone mentioned it's not really organic)$LABEL$0
Too long, too little, nothing new. It is very disappointing to write a poor review on a Clancy novel. One of my favorite authors. The good is that you get to renew all the characters of the previous books that have not been killed off and you enjoy. The story line is disappointing in that it is almost a rehash of the last books with different villians. The most disappointing is even though the book is 1000 pages none of the characters has enough of a central theme to identify with unless they are old friends from previous readings. There were pages upon pages of preaching on all kinds of issues somewhat akind to Ann Rand (Atlas Shrugged). Hope he can find the forumula if there is a next book.$LABEL$0

4 stars for understanding Internet stuff; 2 for exam related. I wrote and past the i-Net+ (1K0-002) today (Mar-5-2004). This book contributed 40% of the content.The content of this book is excellent for understanding Internet-related information. However, from the standpoint of the i-Net+ exam the book missed the mark.The book helped with understanding some of the concepts. The practice questions were way way too easy.The exam was hard... damn hard. I passed with a 83% mark.$LABEL$0
A Superior Work and Recording. If you enjoy baroque music, this is certainly a must. The clarity of this recording is wonderful. It has a kind of depth that I don't often find in CD recordings - almost as if I can reach out and take hold of the music. The fantastic Dresden Concerti are performed nearly flawlessly by Reinhard Goebel and his ensemble on period instruments, lending themselves to create a rich, classic CD recording.$LABEL$1

I look at things different now. I'll be very minimal in words to convey how I feel after reading this book. I can stand in a line that goes around the supermarket several times and I say to myself""How can I control this situation? , No more road rage for me, I don't make fun of other people anymore, In general I am a better person to my wife, kids, peers and everybody out there. Thanks.$LABEL$1
didn't send/didn't return calls/still charged for it. I don't know why they didn't send me the Toddy (that I'd heard so much good about), but they didn't and they didn't return calls and they still charged me for it. When I would call the cust. serv, who never knew what the hell was going on, she'd say, "I see the order. I don't know why you didn't get it. I'll have someone call you about it." They never called.It was July of last year and I was a month away from getting married, so I didn't follow up like I usually would, but I figured eventually it would show up or they'd credit my card. Then I forgot about it, but going through my '07 bills, I stumbled on the cc charge and got agitated all over again.Maybe it's a good product, but if they aren't professional enough to fulfill their offers, you'll never know.$LABEL$0
Opinion of a new teacher.. I am disappointed with this book. I am a new teacher and do not find the ideas in this book helpful at all. The ideas presented are not new, and even new teachers would be capable of thinking these thing up on their own. The book presents ideas such as; how to make finger puppets, how to have a puppet show, writing a story about a "building" (whoopee), how to put a timeline on a bulletin board, how to make a seating chart, etc, etc. Not new ideas at all!$LABEL$0
Just not enough. This soundtrack is like a five course meal stuck at the third course. The music in this film is really what brought it together and was what for me personally put this movie into the good category as opposed to the ok one. There were much more songs that should, could have been on the cd but weren't. Underworld and Thievery Corporation to just name a few were left off the list, even though the songs were very important to the feel of the movie. If anyone knows the entire list of songs from the movie, i would be really glad to get a hold of it. thanks$LABEL$1
I don't even like 'classic rock'. I don't know if that's what this is considered, but I do know that Floyd and Bowie are the only musicians I can stand from 1960-1988. So even you don't think this is your thing you should give it a listen.$LABEL$1
1st time review. After reading all the negative reviews for this product I almost didn't buy it. Lots of complaints about pouring and taste. I have found that after reading reviews on many different products, a large percentage of the negative ones have to do with the user, not the product. When a reputable manufacturer has the same product on the market for an extended time you can be sure they will redesign it for legitimate complaints. I can't figure out why my pot had none of the problems many critics experienced. It performs perfectly has no pouring problems and the coffee is great. I recommend it highly and am glad I bought it. Surely this wasn't just luck.$LABEL$1

Excellent variety of plan selection and skill levels .... As a freelance draftsperson this book is one of four by Sun Designs that I had thepleasure of assisting with. 'Classic Toys in Wood' was a truedelight as was the follow up book 'Making Timeless Toys in Wood'.Classic Toys in Wood contains 40 toy plans including; construction toys,a host of fun toys in the 'boat marina' theme, rocking horses, and more.The book itself contains 12 mini plans as well as an illustrated storyfor children.My niece was just a small child while I was working with theprotypes of these toys. She visited often and of course loved toplay test them. She especially liked the ferris wheel and allthe little people she could put on the ride.Unlike some mass made toys, these stood up to the rigors of play.Along with the mini-plans included in the book you will findexcellent step-by-step instructions and materials lists.Full size plans for all the toys shown in the book can be ordered directly from Sun Designs.$LABEL$1

the second one had less dents then the first!. Well we like the BBQ but the first one we got was so damanged! Dented, broken handles - had to send it back.

Not worth it. Where do I start? Well all the speeches with exception of two are from his first term - his farewell address and the 2000 DNC speech. Many, including the later, are cut short! Why? It makes no sense! And I cannot see any reason for several of the speeches selected for this DVD to be on there. I was under the impression this was supposed to be a collection of his most important and/or greatest speeches to the nation. I was dead wrong! In addition to several others I was really hoping to see I couldn't believe they left out all the state of the union speechs and the 92' and 96' DNC speeches! For any true Bill CLinton fan this DVD is NOT WORTH IT!$LABEL$0
Another tremendous album by Lucy. This one has it all--great, personal lyrics (Just You Tonight will have you running for the kleenex), well-written songs and playing.

If you can get past the shoddy camera work..... you might have been able to watch the entire movie without getting motion sickness. This paparazzi type of film shooting works well occasionally, and gives it a documentary type of feeling. However, when it is as often as it is in this movie you become very aware of the camera and its movements, which detracts from the story and the movie itself. All you become aware of is the CAMERA and the cameraman, and why the hell isn't he using a tripod or something?!?!? Don't most people want to get into a movie and empathize with the characters? I couldn't see how this was possible when we are constantly reminded that they are only actors being filmed by a shakey cameraman.The story was fine. A feel good film, sappy and happy.$LABEL$0

Untruth in Advertising. The subtitle of this book is "Stories of Special Forces from Iraq to Afghanistan." Why then, is over half the book taken from the Vietnam conflict? And one of the stories is by that foul-mouthed self-promoting braggart, Richard Marcenko, a name that makes real navy seals wince in embarassment.There is not one original story in the entire book, and it's the only book I've ever purchased only to realize that I'd read it already. Each article is some re-hashed part of another book that most SF fans will have already read.Very disappointing.$LABEL$0
Beautiful!. We chose this semi-flush mount for our newly remodeled kitchen to add a touch of elegance. It turned out to be very well made. The craftsmanship is very good and the detail is delicate. My only complaint is that the color was not quite the one we thought. It was described as "Etruscan Gold" and on the picture it had nice gold tone. The semi flush we received looked a lot darker, more like bronze color. In the afternoon light you can see the gold tone, but not at night. We decided to keep it anyway because it still matched the overall color scheme of the kitchen. It is a very good light fixture, we are happy with it, and it was easy enough for my husband to install.$LABEL$1

Not Good. This physics book "helped" me through two horrendous semesters of Purdue University physics. There is absolutely no correlation between the text and the homework problems, which lead all of us engineers to wish bad things upon the Purdue physics department and the authors.

Not as advertised and ordered from Amazon/'s Audible Books. The Audible download was described as a trilogy, but it is not. It is only the first two books in this harrowing, fascinating and brilliant series of novels. Apparently the third book is lost in Audible cloud, but I have the Patrick Melrose quartet in one volume, and my sense of loss and agrievement has been assuaged.I will miss Patrick, and his brilliantly written, terse story when I've read the last volume. I will put them away, and pull them out in a few years and return to his world, so richly and unsentimentally described. St. Aubyn's deft portraits hit close to the grain, and will be as fresh 20 years from now as they are today. Cultures may change. People don't.So, no stars for Audible/Amazon, but five for these fast paced, deeply felt and entertaining novels. And buy the books, you will not like being cut off in the middle.$LABEL$0
St. Valentine's Massacre. This is an awful book. His favorite character, Father Blackie, intrudes here and there, but the book is basically about an anchorman, his love life, and a mystery. The writing is poor and repetitious. Greeley (or his amanuensis) was just looking for fillers. Certain phrases are repeated...and repeated...and repeated. And how many times do we want to witness the lovemaking of the middle-aged anchorman and his train-of-thought adoration of his love? I felt like several someones forced themselves to sit down and write 300 words a day, not caring what had been written previously and not being sure where the plot was going. The characters are cardboard cutouts.$LABEL$0
As Beautiful as Poetry. This picture book for gardeners is a small volume of watercolor illustrations detailing every aspect of gardening. This is a book to look at and browse through.

Just another myth. While it is possible to get some power gains by insulating your intake tube (that is, only if the tube is being subject to large amounts of heat), it is just impossible to get "100 HP" gain and "50 MPG" fuel consumption. Such remarks would just come from someone who works for the company and is trying to sell the product. If these gains were true, all the companies selling the high end performance mods would go out of business with people buying this product. A built as mentioned on the previous post would imply this person having an intake attached to a turbo, which will get hot regardless unless you have an intercooler for the air to get colder, denser and therefore, providing more power to your car.$LABEL$0
Great Sabbath Tribute CD. This Sabbath Tribute CD is great. It's much better than Nativity in Black 2 and Masters of Misery. The music sounds great. But anyone who listens for the first time may not like some of the vocals. They have a black and death metal sound to them. So if your a black metal or a death metal fan you'll like this CD. The best songs on the CD are: Snowblind,Hand of Doom,Johny Blade,and Symptom of the Universe. I recommend it to any die hard Sabbath fan.$LABEL$1

Great idea, but will break very easily and won't work well on toilets!. I purchased this product after reading all the reviews and watching Claire's review video, but although it might work well on the bath tub or the sink, it does not work well on toilets. I tried unclogging my toilet possibly 10+ different times, but no matter how accurately I did it, my toilet is still clogged. Also, after less than 20 attempts, the pump broke and won't air seal broke and won't hold more than 4 pumps. (supposed to hold up to 20-30)So as much as great of an idea this product is, it won't really work on toilets (although it does work OK on tubs/sinks) and might break easily (mine broke in two days).$LABEL$0

Mr. Krueger's Christmas. I love and adore Jimmy Stewart; I always have and always will. His movies are timeless and his humanity and humility, as an actor, are inspirational to people everywhere.

This movie was ok.... I gave this movie only 4 stars because it was not that belivable to me, and while a movie does not need to be.... this one i was expecting to be almost based off a true life story.Besides that though, this movie was relitivly a mild-paced movie, some parts were a little slow, and in the end there was a twist ending. This movie may not be the best movie to show to younger kids, because they may get afraid of the concpet of someone knowing their whole life and trying to kill people.Robin Williams did a good job, and all the characters in this movie were very well played! There was not much of a plot, but what they did have was pretty well planed.There was no "Thrilling" special/visual effects and no "Stand-Out" music, but that's ok because this type of movie does not require eaither.This might be a movie to rent though, as it is one of those that you can see twice and be done with.~Hope this helps$LABEL$1
NOT for use in the SUMMER. If you are planning on making Ice cream in the Summertime...forget it...I spent almost a hundred bucks....(I know thats what happens when you get these big ideas on baking good) at the store....pre mixed everything...set the batter in the freezer...after freezing the bowl for 2 days...was practically exctatic that I was going to have fresh cold ice cream within 20 minutes!! I had all the toppings...all the goodies....well...20 minutes later I go back to the blender and the batter is still the same as when I poured it...I am not completely blaming the product...HOWEVER......Im just hoping that you read this...to warn you that this product is better to use maybe in the cooler months...then it may work fine. =]$LABEL$0

Great Read. This book was really good. Teens can relate to Anna. She has to go through boy trouble, social status, mean girls, and parenting problems. Cammie, Sam, and Dee think Anna is just an A-list wanna be. While Cammie's ex, and major hottie, Ben, and Anna are falling for each other. Plus there's the hot limo driver. Her dad doesn't have any time for her because of his job and his new girlfriend that is just like Anna's mom. This book will keep you hooked. I read it in 1 day. I'm sure you'll love the drama.$LABEL$1

Cant Find It Anywhere. This cd in my opinion is one of the best if not the best in the underworld record label. As a matter of fact this is one of the best rap albums ever made. Not just in chicano rap bcuz in that category they are the best for sure but in any kind of rap they are the best. My favorite songs on the album are-#1- Ordinary Day#4- Coastin#5- Freakin#8- Very Next Day#9- Float On#10- LostBut what pi$$es me off is that I cannot find this cd in any local stores here I have looked at so many and I was looking for the cd while on my period and I was getting so emotional (bcuz during your period you feel like that, girls you can understand) and almost crying cuz of my dam* period and the fact that I couldnt get the cd. Well anywayz get this cd if your lucky enough and can find it YOU WONT REGRET IT.Oh yeah if anyone from here know where to find the cd tell me.And another question is the Mr Capone-e chicano or pakistani?$LABEL$1
Not what I had expected. This book didn't teach me anything I didn't already know. I guess I should have read the title before I bought the book. I was expecting Computer security auditing 102 and got Hax0r1ng ExP0sed: your 800 page ub3r l33t guide to take you half way to script kiddie! I'm not saying that this book doesn't have any decent information, I am just saying that it's not for the guru. I could rewrite this entire book in fewer than 40 pages.$LABEL$0
Disappointing. This a great book, so why the 2 stars? The book states on the cover that it is a revised edition complete with 1/96 scale fold-out plan. Well when they revised the book I guess they took the fold-out plan "OUT". I couldn't find it. I bough 4 books in this series and they all say the same thing but NO PLANS. If it wasn't that the other information in the book is great I would have returned all 4. Still a disappointment.$LABEL$0
VERY HARD READ. This book is very hard to read. I have successfully made it 3/4 through the book, but it's because I have been forcing myself to continue reading. I do like some of the points the book makes, and think it has a wonderful message, just wish it was easier to read. Uses A LOT of big words that are not everyday words for the average person, which forces you to have to think longer on each sentence you read. Would find myself having to read the page 2-3 times in order to get the point. As said, it does have a great message, but I believe it could have been written as a better flow of words. I would only recommend this book to someone that is an avid Theological reader, not an average Christian looking to deapen their spiritual relationship with the Lord.$LABEL$0
Amazon's Look Inside of 212 Degrees. I have to say that the "Look Inside" preview that Amazon has pout together for this book is totally useless. I use this function often and have purchased many books based upon the insight that it has given me. For 212 Degrees, it it essentially nothing but the cover and inside and outside flaps. That leads me to believe that the substance of this book is very weak and; therefore, I will not be making the purchase.$LABEL$0
where did the old Dean Koontz go?. I have read all of Koontz's books and I anxiously awaited this book and after reading it, I knew the wait wasn't worth it. I had just read Odd Thomas and so hoped this new book would be better. Alas it wasn't. Where of where did our Dean Koontz of Dark Rivers of the Heart and Watchers and Dragon Tears, etc.go? He would so carfully craft a story and draw you into it so deep that you couldn't wait to finish it but you didn't want it to end. This book was so formulaic that you really didn't have to finish it to know what was going to happen. In his early books, every word he typed seemed important to the story. In this book, you have page after page of almost nothing but adjectives. I want my old Koontz back. This book was not worth the read.$LABEL$0
Strength and perseverance. This is a good movie. Thora Birch is convincing. The story is incredible. Sometimes it is a little slow but it's worth the time one takes to see it. It's inspirational.$LABEL$1
Rambling. Unlike the author, I'll be concise. The book was rambling, disorganized and lacked structure. There were several memorable anecdotes and one gets a good grasp for the life of a struggling professional golfer. However, Mr. Feinstein was obviously under time pressure to complete the book because it was difficult to follow.$LABEL$0
Enemy at the gates. Awesome movie, graphic as it gets. MANY head shots :) Some of the actors suck though, little bit of cheesyness on their parts. Would buy it if I were you. Imagine Saving Private Ryan only with a lot more snipers.$LABEL$1
Weak Fire Hose. It is an over rated toy. My year old labradoodle shreeded it within two days. Indestructible my a**. Chew proof, hardly.$LABEL$0
rip off. if you are going to print a few large pictures every now and then and that is it, then maybe this printer is for you. but if you are a normal person who likes to print off several photos as well as e-mails, internet documents and other normal stuff, then this printer is a nightmare. it is constantly constantly constantly running out of one of its eight color cartridges and then it won't even let you print in black! it is expensive to keep all of that ink around! then half the time it prints your picture poorly, so you have to print it again and, well, there goes your ink. i am so angry i purchased this thing. it is huge and incompetent. i hate it. i recommend you get a normal small reliable printer and then send away for your prints.$LABEL$0
Avons eyeliner gimmick!. I was introduced to Avon through a friend who sells it. I really wanted a superior product and there prices seems fair, checked out reviews and made purchase. I purchased Avon Glimmer stick in black and brown. I bought it from an avon store. I must say Im disapointed. I mean the stick breaks off easy (im gentle and dont even use it everyday), didnt even last 6 months. I had the SAME experience with the mascara, all of a sudden one day I went in to use it and it was broken.(how does mascara break) Not even 6 months of use.$LABEL$0
Missing Holes, Not That Easy to Assemble. On the left side panel, 3 out of 8 holes for the back braces were missing. It took two people to assemble. The final product is decent. But for the price I paid, I expected higher quality in manufacturing.$LABEL$0
The Secret (Audio CD Set) - Rhonda Byrne. If Ms Byrne only knew how her unprofessional voice and amateur reading style detracts from the powerful messages imparted in this set, she would have it re-recorded by a professional. Good material - poorly presented.$LABEL$0
Very Nice - Especially for the Price. I got this about two weeks ago, and now I've put it to a fair test: During driving. I think the so called "Shock Protection" saved it most of the time, after all, these aren't the worst roads. But suffice to say, it never skipped. So, it works great! However the car kit that came with it only worked one time when I hit PLAY, and it only made output in the left ear. Good thing I brought batteries! The AC Adapter is included as well and is a nice touch. The headphones included are high quality. Finally, I haven't tried the cassette adapter, for I have no use for it when I could have CD quality =) Why four stars then, and not five? Well, perhaps for the poor car kit, but also for looks. Looks don't matter though, that's a silly thing to judge, right? Go and buy it! $50!$LABEL$1
Right stock number wrong product. Ordered replacement part only to find out the stock number for part is wrong had to order part direct from mfg.$LABEL$0
Fantastic Box Set To Own ...... There's not much things to say about such an epic of a movie. It's simply one of the best Blu ray to own. For the record, I don't see any problem on the green tint issues posted by some reviewers. On my Panny Plasma P50GT50 via the OPPO 93 player, not a problem. The picture is simply gorgeous and the accompanied audio was darn good too !!!$LABEL$1
Brick Brick Brick. Do not buy this. I opened the box and hooked everything up. It was detected as an unknown device and none of the drivers would install. ADS Tech sent me a BRICK. Buy any other brand.$LABEL$0
Cheap is not Better - Buyer Beware!!. Okay, it has been 48 hours since I purchased the first one from Best Buy and now I am preparing to return the 3rd one to Circuit City! First one had a broken dvd drive, would not recognize any disk, 2nd one windows would not work, third one has a bad modem. DO NOT BUY! I can't believe how much time and effort I have wasted, not to mention money because of having both stores do the set up and adware removal, only to go through this. In addition to all the faulty manufacturing, I found it to be REALLY slow, more so than my current 4 yr. old model and the graphics are very low quality and antiquated looking. Save yourself the trouble.$LABEL$0
Shred & Tighten. From day one I felt like my body was tightening. I've been doing a weight class for several months but level one kicked my butt.I have tendonitis in my shoulder so I had some concerns but the workout seems to be working out the shoulder & it is feeling better.$LABEL$1
Dont buy this. It worked for a few months, then started to say system unavalibe all the time, if you reset the system it works for about a day before saying this again, freezes up when checking voice mail or trying to call people randomly, no more updates on firmware so please do not buy this as a warning; THEY HAVE DROPED SUPPORT FOR THIS PRODUCT. I have an IT degree and have messed with this item for a while beliving that tweeking it would help, but sometimes things just do not work. Skype is a good service, dont screw it up buy purchasing this phone.$LABEL$0
Convicts Candy, Was Just Tooooo Much For Words.. When I Saw The Cover Of This Book, I Knew I Had To Purchase It.Afer Reading The First 2 Chapters, I Couldnt Put The Book Down. Candy Was A "Transexual" Who Caught AIDS & Died. Doing Her Time While She Was In Prison , She Had Many Sexual Escapades, With Brothers The Were "On The Low" But Wanted No One To Know.. It Seem To Me That Some These Brothers Were Just Drawn To Her Because If Her Beauty... Candy Had It Going On.. Do Ya Thang Boo. This Book Was Really Good....$LABEL$1

not his best. i would truly give this cd 1 1/2 stars but i can't. i can see where he was trying to go with this one musically, but it's just not happening.

Totally Chuffed!!!. This is easily one of the top two or three metal albums of all time. This is the Reign In Blood of the Death Metal/Grind Core genre. Amazing lyrics, written with sheer honesty and brutality. As far as the music and songwriting goes, its furious and relentless. Pintado, Harris and Embury are songwriting gods. They combine speed, grind and crunch like no other. Support the mighty Naplam and buy this and then go see them live. If you get a chance to hang with them, I assure you, you won't be disappointed. The eternal Gods of Grind!!$LABEL$1
Good book, stupid layout. This book has a lot of good info and photos. But the layout is the stupidest thing I've seen in a book. Most of the photos are spread across two pages and since this book is quite thick, the centers of the pictures are curved and it ruins the photos. The info and the photos in the book should get 5 stars but the layout has ruined everything. They have also missed IL 2 which I believe is the most produced aircraft in history if not in the second world war. They have included aircraft models that are much insignificant but missed IL 2. Some would argue that IL 2 was a ground attack aircraft but not a fighter but almost half of this book is dedicated to bombers and other non fighting aircraft. I give 2 stars because it makes me mad to see all the good photographs in this book spread across two pages which looks like the author is mocking me.$LABEL$0
Boring Workout. This workout is not without challenge. So, even though it starts out easy, some of the sections get your heart rate up and and you will work up a sweat. However, the fact that each segment begins with its own warmup makes it too disruptive to do as one complete workout. Also, Keli Roberts is by herself, there are no background exercisers, and she is just no fun at all. I found this workout incredibly boring.I recommend Amy Bento, Cathe Friedrich or Chalene Johnson for fun and challenging kickboxing workouts, but don't waste your time and money on this one.$LABEL$0
Ride the Rocket!. This book is like riding on the back of a rocket. It takes off and never lets up. A great read!$LABEL$1

smells.... strong rubber odor. I would have loved this product if it wasn't for its smell. I really tried. I even washed it with soap and everything.. but the smell won't go away. I can't stand surrounded by stench of car tire smell. Does it really make that much difference in manufacturing cost to have it made with just a slightly above the quality than the ones they used? If it wasn't for the smell, I'd be buying them in bulk and place it everywhere I sit and also pass it along to friends as a gift!$LABEL$0
Great Condition Majora's Mask Game Guide. This game guide came on time and is in near perfect condition. There was only a small tear on the binding of the book. My son was thrilled he had a guide to go with the game and the interior was in mint condition.$LABEL$1
Not like the original one. I had really liked the original version of this book which is meant for slightly older children. So I got this for my 14 month old daughter. She is least interested in it although she loves books and has many favorites. I didnt like it much either. There is no rhythm and the text doesnt flow very well. In fact, the last few pages just contain a bunch of alphabets thrown in as if in a hurry to finish the book. There are better books out there!$LABEL$0
Don't bother. This book is a sad reminder of what repugnicans once were. How can a party sink to multitudes of degrees of filth and worthlessness.$LABEL$0
Recommended. I really enjoyed this but didn't absolutely love it. Nice animation. Interesting story. Mostly likable sprinkled with a few annoying characters. Recommended on blu-ray for sure. I can't say I will be watching it over and over. But it's definitely worth a go$LABEL$1

One of the best technical analysis. This is, in my opinion, one of the best technical analysis books out there.The approach of Richard Wyckoff was developed in the beginning of the century and it still applies. He shows you, in great details, how through price, volume and trend lines you can identify what a stock is doing and what it is about to do. And he did all of it by hand!!!The system is pure and, if combined with other indicators, moving averages, etc. can be powerful.The book is full of technical information. It is condensed, not an easy read but worth every penny and it is one of the least expensive books out there.I highly recommend it.$LABEL$1

Compatibility problem. I got this for Christmas for use with a Cassiopeia E125. The software loaded fine, but the receiver did not appear to get a signal. The Ambicom office was closed during Christmas break, so I put it aside. This week I e-mailed Ambicom. Their response is as follows:"Unfortunately, the software is not compatible with PDA OS. It's only for Pocket PC 2002 and 2003. Sorry for this incovenient caused."Amazon's product description and the (sparse) Ambicom documentation did not reveal this detail. Now I'm stuck with something I probably can't use.$LABEL$0
Controversy mistaken for depth. The only thing that makes this book even appear to be worthwhile is it's "controversial topic" (which is advertised right on the cover). I was so irritated with how awful this book was it took me over an hour to chill my brain enough to start a new one. So often controversy is mistaken for depth. This book had none. I thought it was going to be great but the more I read the more I was proved wrong. The characters are absurdly one-dimensional while constantly try to claim otherwise through out the book but ultimately don't. This book is not even worth the paper it is printed on. Normally if I don't like a book I donate to the thrift store or give it BCID on bookcrossing. This one I tossed directly into the recycling.$LABEL$0
Prepare to be blown away!!!!!. "Fireproof" byfar surpasses "Above". The music is harder and has more of an edge. It's amazing how Rob can be screaming one minute and then singing softly the next. To those Christian alternative fans, this is a must have. The song "Further" is this album's equivalent of "Father", and it is amazing. The whole album will keep you head bobbing throught. This album is as good as P.O.D.'s "Satellite". So, if you haven't gotten it, get it. You will not be disappointed.$LABEL$1
Unbelievable!!!. I'm not one to read books but when a guy friend of mine preseented me with this one i had to go ahead. This book sat on my shelf for 1 month before I finally picked it up. It was wonderful!!! I read the entire thing in one day. What a thing for someone who dislikes reading!! I can't wait to buy his other books!!$LABEL$1
Book condition not rated correctly. When I received the book the glue on the binding is falling apart and the book is split in half when you open it because it is in such poor condition and was not rated that way. I have to repair the binding myself so it wont fall apart in the middle of my class.$LABEL$0
Helpful Resource. This book is a great place to get new ideas when working with children. Its also been a great resource to reccomend to new therapists. I have used the "Sticky Dots" intervention on serveral occasions.$LABEL$1
Hilarious!!. This is my favorite movie of all time and I have seen a lot of movies.I can watch this one over and over and over and it still makes me laugh everytime.

Fits my MacBook Pro Perfectly!. This sleeve works great to protect my 15" MacBook Pro and looks great as well! My notebook goes in and zips up easily, even with the snug fit. The pocket on top would fit a small ipod or jump drive, but definitely not big enough to hold much more. I like the slim lines of this product because it makes it easy to fit into another bag or a backpack for transport.$LABEL$1
Not adequate. Bought these for my two adult chins. The male is tiny, but he was somewhat cramped in it and only used this until I added a fleece house - now he only uses this for a platform. It's also not heavy or stable enough for them to use as a platform - on shavings it will tip slightly and startle them when they jump on it. Additionally, they jump on it with enough force that the top comes off daily, so eventually I had to nail it down so they wouldn't fall on it awkwardly.The female is much longer than the male, and she looked really uncomfortable in this whenever she had to turn around in it. She too abandoned it, and I didn't even give her an alternate nest box.I know the price is attractive, but now I have two houses that I'm going to pull out and replace with more substantial, large boxes. I definitely don't recommend this house type at all.$LABEL$0
Goodness, such language. The little girl in this movie must have aged 20 years during its filming. Language is so gross, it is unintentionally funny at times. A real gore-fest.$LABEL$1
Magnificent. This is simply one of my favorite musical works. Something like this could easily have drifted into very cheesy territory indeed, but this is first class. I actually prefer this version to the original Silk Road albums. This well-done orchestral interpretation brings something extra out of the music. It's a lovely, enjoyable piece of music.$LABEL$1
In very poor taste. I agree with other reviewers that this well is dry and the family is no longer interesting. But that disappointment is mild compared to the disgust I felt that she used the Twin Towers tragedy to plump up her character's adventures. First time I'd seen our national tradedy experienced by fictional characters and it is in very poor taste and so lacking in sensitivity that I won't read her again.$LABEL$0

too bad to even be funny. Sometimes rap music, like horror movies, are so incredibly bad they end up being funny. Not this. Maybe because he obviously takes himself so seriously or because he is such a scumbag, I have no sympathy for him and his ridiculous music.

wonderful layout, full of incredible inspirational media art. I just picked this book up in NY and I'm blown away. Every time I eye it on my shelf I have to stop what I'm doing and pull it out, sit on the floor, and pour over the pages... This is wonderful art for the generation X/Y age group. Not to cram too many buzzwords into this review, but this stuff really is on the edge... it's out there... I'll be a happy man is this is the direction the art world takes in the next few years...This book takes an empty approach to design... lots of white and black space with strange freeze frames of different video and web pieces. Unlike most of the digital art books today, this does not have a companion CD-rom. Thats what makes this book so interesting, is that you have digital moving art, frozen, taken out of context, and put to paper. There's not many books like this, too bad.$LABEL$1
HUH?. The Stretching is waaay to long! Get to it Already! 2ndly The Dance moves are not properly gone over, so you're left LOST threw out the workout.

Most interesting characters from Indian Mythology.. Indian mythological literature is full of interesting and fascinating characters. This book is an entertaining collection of stories drawn from Indian myths and legends of yore. The colourfully illustrated book has stories about many less known characters from our legends as well as some of our favourites. The book is specially written for kids. The language is simple and sentences are short.Read this book if you like to know about Kumbhakaran, Ravana's brother whose daily diet consists of thousand plates of vegetable curry, two thousand bowls of chicken, three thousand platters of kheer, five hundred live goats, five hundred baskets of raw fish, two hundred whole banana trees, mountains of rice and a hundred barrels of wine.$LABEL$1
cozy. Great, i get to be the 4th reviewer. I guess that about sums up how popular this band is. Well, rare gems are hard to find. This disk has a lot of variety but DMST definitely has a distinct sound. I have there previous 2 disks and think this one is the best. Has a more warm cozy, country feel to it. Some of it is very beautiful, some slightly annoying and noisy. If you are investigating them because of godspeed and the constellation stuff, they are not the same. Well, you do get some tremelo guitar (what's with that anyway), but the music is far more pleasant and palatible. enjoy$LABEL$1
a disappointment. This book purports to based on high quality research. If so, the author has not made a good comunication job of setting it forth. I found the book superficial. It was also looked through by a true scientist resident here and panned it badly. It's a good idea not well done in my opinion$LABEL$0

The Stand to the Nth power. This novel is fantastic. It starts to drag in the middle, but the fast-paced action and in-depth characterizations are marvelous.

The Best Anthro Fiction. Wilson's Crazy February is perhaps the best example of anthro fiction that I've read, and gives a much clearer idea of life in Chiapas than most anthro nonfiction. Crazy February gives the reader an acute sense of what it is really like to live there. I'd also recommend Peter Matthiessen's Far Tortuga as another wonderful example.$LABEL$1
Beware: This is NOT a Microsoft headset. I ordered this headset, thinking it would be an original Microsoft headset, and was disappointed to see a cheap knockoff after opening the package. The microphone can only be used on the left side, which sucks because I usually have it on the right side. The pictures all show a Microsoft XBOX 360 headset and the manufacturer even says "Microsoft". Totally false advertising. I will never buy from this seller again.$LABEL$0
Nuvi- inexpensive and satisfactory. I work as an Admissions counselor for a University and do a lot of traveling. Frustrated with the pages of directions from online map sites, I got advice from friends and tried the Nuvi. I've found it to be extremely helpful when finding high schools and colleges. It has also assited me in finding local food places. One great feature I've loved is the ability to search for hotels near my destination. The thing my boss loves is that he's saving money in printing and gas (yeah for not getting lost!)A couple of problems- I've found that the turning warning is about 50 feet off. (still need to call garmin help about that) Some businesses are slightly before or after the location that the Nuvi has recorded.I'm planning on buying at least one more for our admissions office, and am very happy with how the Nuvi has helped me to be on time to the various appointments that go along with my profession.$LABEL$1
Pop-up top impossible to open and close. I was really excited to get a stainless steel water bottle with a pop top for exercising and a mouth large enough to put ice cubes in, at a decent price. Unfortunately I didn't heed the other comments about the pop-up top being hard to open and close. For me, it was next to impossible. The cap doesn't fit snug onto the pop-up top, so that when looped around your finger, it justs pops right off and the bottle falls to the floor or ground. Poor design. If you don't care about using the pop top (one of the main reasons I bought the bottle), this is a good bottle for the price.$LABEL$0
Barbara has a great voice. Wow, Barbara Streisand has such a nice voice. In this musical, I love the songs "people", "I'd rather be blue over you" and "I'm the greatest star." Everyone says that Barbara Streisand is so ugly, but personally, I think she's actually kind of pretty. Yeah, her nose is big, but other than that she's not that bad. Anyway, it's just a really great movie. THe only problem with it is that the romantic scenes were a little too numerous and kind of boring.$LABEL$1
Not that Great. Another toy that's just taking up space. I have been looking for the prefect bath toy for a while and still haven't found it! :( My kids are 2 1/2 and 1 so maybe they are just too young, but I wish I could go back in time because I would not have ordered this. I wasted money again!$LABEL$0
What a disgusting, pointless piece of garbage. Not only is this a complete waste of money, it is also a waste of an hour and a half of your life. I felt like I was watching one of those pathetic, schlocky B-movies from the 1970's. Whoever is responsible for making this should be penalized and the people who promoted it as even remotely watchable should be ostracized.$LABEL$0
PHOTO IS WRONG. This does not include the decorative ring pictured. It may work for a 1/2-inch stub, but it has a large and clearly visible (except in the photos...) hole in the bottom for a set screw to secure it. Who thought that was a good idea?Was hunting for a solid and more substantial spout than what is offered individually in the local stores. It feels solid and substantial (thus 2 stars), but is fatally flawed. Had to return it.$LABEL$0
Great pacing and extremely enjoyable!. If you're a horror fan -- or more importantly a zombie fan -- than this is going to be on the top of your list of "must reads." The pacing is fast, the zombies are different enough and terrifying and the characters are fun to read about. There's also a good bit of tension thrown in. Smith does a great job of throwing monkey wrenches into his characters' lives... and it makes for a fun read. It starts out great, sets the mood and never really slows down.The writing style is accessible and concise and flows extremely well.This book deserves a spot right next to all your favorite horror novels.$LABEL$1
Well worth the money. I suffered from Panic Disorder for more than 10 years. Every GP i saw told me i would never be cured and offered me medication to keep my anxiety under control. Thankfully I never accepted the drugs. When i was at the end of my tether feeling totally worthless and helpless, i found The Linden Method. I bought it, thinking i was maybe being conned as i was at my lowest ebb. I have to say i cried when i first started to read the manual. And the Panic Attack Eliminator was like an epiphany. The Linden Method is honest, safe and has a real understanding of how panic can control your life. The after sales support is also superb.I am not totally cured, but i know this is mostly down to me. The Method itself is sound, and if it doesn't completely cure you, I'm sure it will at the very least make your panic disorder much more manageable.Very strongly recommended.$LABEL$1
Nightfox laser dance song.

You can probably buy it on ebay or your local underground music store.$LABEL$0
This review is for the 3D Version - HORRIBLE - Don't waste your time!.... I've proudly collected most all 3D Blurays available in the US since the beginning. I must say that I ROBOT is the worst 3D conversion I've ever experienced. I actually sold it on ebay for $9. It looked like a pop-out book - simply unsatisfactory. FOX/SONY has boasted about their new techniquest to convert 2D Classics to 3D classics. Note to Fox/Sony: PLEASE DON"T RUIN ANY FURTHER CLASSICS IN YOUR CATALOG WITH THIS QUALITY CONVERSION. I was so Dissappointed - a Great Movie in a horrible 3D presentation.Sony/Fox should take some pointers from Pixar or James Cameron for the future 2D- 3D conversion. You thought Last Airbender 3D was bad - experience I-ROBOT and it makes the Airbender look like a classic. Shame on you Fox/Sony - Give us better quality 3D Conversions and we'll buy them.$LABEL$0
AWESOME STORY. The photo of President Kennedy with future President Clinton in the crowd is eerily ironic. For you people looking for some kind of embarassing kiss & tell story, try another book. If you want to see how one of the great minds of our times work, this is the book. President Clinton's accomplishments were many. He was and IS loved around the world. This book celebrates him, and we applaud him! I am honored to have been alive during his years as our leader.$LABEL$1

Don't Waste Your Money. Painful to watch. Baldwin , as usual, has zero ability to project ANY emotion whatsoever.

Bad Title. It's not a strategy book.. This is a book about openings. It's not your typical strategy book. Since it is an openings book, the material is very outdated. If you want to learn about the ideas behind the openings then I would recommend Discovering Chess Openings by Emms. If you are want a more detailed book on all the major openings then I would get Fundamental Chess Openings. FCO is a good reference book, but for the most part, it just lists moves and doesn't try to teach you about opening theory. If you are looking for a strategy book then I suggest Modern Chess Strategy by Pachman.$LABEL$0
Norah's shining moment. Norah Jones may not have the keyboard proficiency of Dianna Krall nor the polished vocal range of Sade but she has what the others don't have - eight Grammys. Whether the Grammy was a one-hit-wonder glitch or a confirmation of her talents is a moot issue.What is obvious in this New Orleans performance is her artistry -- no embellishments, just simplicity and grace. Norah exudes femininity which is sometimes hard to convey in a jazz setting; her voice, oftentimes soulful and melancholic, comes across intimately in Lonestar, Bessie Smith, The Painter Song and the surprise encore Tennessee Waltz. Her now familiar "Don't Know Why" and "Come Away with Me", performed live, are enough reasons for having this DVD.In the musical world where artistic integrity are often compromised, it is nice to have for more than a 'brief shining moment' a lone star like Norah Jones.$LABEL$1
A must-have for all 80's hard rock fans!. This is the second part of a 2 volume movie set highlighting the Moscow Music Peace Festival from August 12th and 13th, 1989. It has concert footage from Motley Crue, Gorky Park, Ozzy Osbourne, Scorpions and an awesome jam which went on at the end of the concert. It also has alot of backstage footage with the bands and fans. This is one movie you must have!$LABEL$1

A let down follow up cd.. I read in a magazine interview that Miss. Jones did not want to be seen as "Just A Jazz Singer" an on this cd she wanted to show her country music influence, which she got growing up in Dallas, Tx. On a side note she came out of the same perfoming and visual art school as fellow Dallas Texans, the great contempary jazz trumpter Roy Hargrove, and neo-soul singer Erykah Badu. Back to this cd, while I really like her voice, she is out of her league as some sort of neo-country female singer. Although the cd does have it's solid moments such as track 11 "The Prettiest Things." I give her credit for try to branch out into different sounds,but one must know what works and what does not. I hope that by her next new cd she knows the The quote of Miles Davis "Great Music, like great art is more define by what's left out, rather than what's put in."$LABEL$0

A twisted mess of the heart. This is the first Jodi Picoult book I've read, and it helped me easily fall in love with her writing style. Easy to read, keeps you interested and captured. This is a love story like no other, with twists and turns that will make it difficult to put it down. Highly recommended, however, be warned that the material in this book is difficult to read.$LABEL$1
Excellent. I installed this product in my 2000 Honda Civic. I did not use the ground wire supplied, because it says not to when a charger is used, which I use. The sound quality is excellent!

Works well.. I was skeptical at first but after a few tries I caught on and was able to use it satisfactorily with a wet brush. I thought that it might be real handy for air travelers who face unreasonable limitations on what they can bring. I still think I would prefer my conventional Kiss My Face cream or a good mug soap because it provides ready lather for the second or third passes where with this stick you would have to rub the stick again and again. All in all you do get a close comfortable shave.$LABEL$1
Good Salesman, Bad Advice. Dr. Grey, with a PhD from a university closed down by the State of California as a diploma mill, is a great salesman and story teller. Although his thesis in his new diet and exercise book is intriguing, Grey does not give any references whatsoever as to from where his theories about hormones and their role in nutrition come. Some facts in the books seem dubious, "..the brain uses 20 percent of the calories we consume."However, because the caloric intake of his nutrition system should be less than the reader would normally take, participants in the system should show a loss of weight over time. And because the theory is novel, a reader will also tend to believe everything Grey says, as believe they "feel" better.I would feel safer about his nutrition ideas if he had added an appendix of references to scientific or even to popular literature that could confirm his ideas as good science.$LABEL$0

Not particularly moving. It's a nice, fast summer read, and I must admit to shedding a tear or two, but overall, I didn't like it.I don't think I'll be reading more James Patterson. For one thing, he is totally unconvincing as a 35-year-old female. I mean come on. There's this one line about an "upside-down ponytail" and it almost made me quit reading and throw the book against the wall in frustration. Funny how little things like that can throw off the whole experience. Generally for me, this was not dense enough to be a real romance. Badabing badaboom, they're in love. But why? No one knows.Anyway, if you're in the mood for a fluffy read, you might be ok with this one. Otherwise, skip it.$LABEL$0
Waste of Money. This video is boring and does not even teach word problems as it states it does, just regular math problems.

Overpriced and incomplete. As per usual, my ratings given are for this release, and not for the content.Simply put, this is not a a true "Collector's Edition". It's priced as one, but it's not at all a complete edition, something on this scale and at this price should include all the original japanese language soundtrack with english subtitles.A real let down.Sadly even if you remember it in english as a child, you don't get that because the studio destroyed the original copies. So it's not so good for nostalgia, and not good for japanese animation buffs.$LABEL$0
Not that great. First off, most of her songs are so repetitive that they get really annoying and irritating to listen to. The first 3 songs are somewhat more rock, but after that most of them just sound like mandy moore songs with a guitar. The lyrics aren't that great either, just the typical pop stuff going around now. One song - beautiful - even sounds like a brittany spears song. The only thing I can say about this album is that the songs, just like most songs on the radio now, get stuck in your head quite easily. Don't waste your money; go buy Brand New's album - Deja Entendu, or Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper.$LABEL$0
Adults' Fairy Tale. It is a true fable where all is well that ends well. Mr. Reiner writes with ease about persons with distinguished achievements, wealth, and health. Even the ones who are sick are made to seem fit. There is a reason behind everything and each character possesses great human values such as compassion and understanding. Even the ogre of the tale has his good sides. Of course, the whole story is light and full of mirth. That is Mr. Reiner's style. He knows how to make people laugh. There is a minor story within the main story. Both are equally enjoyable. Nat, the main character, suffers from serious personality disorder that he succumbs to seeing a therapist. One thing leads to another and he is on the journey of searching the truth of his origin. He finds out a lot of information and a few close relations. It is first and foremost a love story between men and women and among family members. When told in Mr. Reiner's wild humor, it becomes more pleasing.$LABEL$1

A Gift Book for the Spiritual Journey. This small format, hard cover gift book is a treasure. In 99 pages, we read a variety of quotations from Mother Teresa. Recurring themes include nature, prayer, and love. We learn that the attention she got from the media was a burden to her, endured willingly because publicity for her work drew attention to the poor. She found speaking in public torture, saying it was easier for her to bathe a leper than to answer a journalist's questions.The content of these brief passages is complemented by Mother Teresa's gift for language, for example, "I am only God's pencil, one that he uses to sketch whatever he wants," and "love's garment has a hem that reaches into the dust, and brushes it away." Every page has a message with the power to inspire.$LABEL$1
Not one of her better efforts. I get the impression that EP wrote this book(and set it in the past) because the Amelia Peabody series may be losing some of its appeal. After all, Amelia and Emerson are now getting old (hard to believe that Emerson can still be an ageless 'hunk' in those later books). So is EP trying to recall the 'glory days' of this series?I found the story and characters to be 'small' compared to her other books. This book was simply not up to the usual EP standard.On a more personal note. After ready all of the books in this series I am starting to grow weary of the pretentiousness, superiority and pomposity of the entire Emerson family.$LABEL$0
Very True. This book hit me harder than any book I have read recently, not because of the writing, but because this was me. This was my college experience, ast least what I can remember of it :) and I can identify with many of the authors statements and feelings to be accurate. The scary part is that it is normal to use alchol like this in collage and early adulthood in america. Drinkomg untill you pass out is not abnormal but expected in many young adult settings and those that do not are not cool. This book is scary and true, and made me look at the way I drink.$LABEL$1

A wonderful mix. What a wonderful mix of in-depth information about both Jean Shepherd's body of work (which to me seems timeless) and revealing interviews that draw Shepherd's enigmatic life and humanity into sharper focus. Bergmann does a fine job of explaining why Shep's fans are so loyal; what were Shep's best contributions to radio, TV, film, literature, and stage; and does this while making us aware of Shep's enigmatic less-than-perfect personal life. This latter subject, however, does not detract from portraying the man as an overall likeable character or significant artist. A great read for anyone, whether familiar with Jean Shepherd's work or not. Thank you Eugene Bergmann!$LABEL$1

Really good fans for the price.. These fans are really good for the price. I bought two for my house.

Died after 2 years. I bought this unit about 2 years ago. I had to return the initial unit because it did not work correctly (thanks to Cabellas customer service). The second unit worked well for a while (yes it was a long set-up), but we were happy with it. The rain guage stopped working pretty early on, as did the humidity/weather condition sensor. However, the 2 parts we used most, which were the temperature readings in and out and the anemometer, seemed to work very well until we hit the 2 year mark. Then the whole unit went out and no matter of new batteries, reset, or anything else will make the unit function. It might be inexpensive for a weather station, but $240 is not cheap by my standards to have the product only last for 2 years. Not sure that I can recommend it. Too bad, because I think Oregon Scientific usually puts out a good product.$LABEL$0
Save yourselves. This book is a must have for anyone who has never had an independent thought in their life. I couldn't keep my eyes open trying to read this book. For anyone who thinks on their own from time to time, this book contains chapter after torturous chapter of common sense information, spelling out the most fundamental ideas over painful lengths of text. If you have never thought about anything, ever, and would like for the first time to try it out, then this book might be a useful guide for you. My apologies to the authors of glowing reviews on this book, but you should have recommended a toaster and a bathtub to go with it.$LABEL$0
Start with a different book. I was fascinated by some video performances so I wanted to find out more about Mercury.

Very cute adorable piano.. But my daughter lost interest !. Lots of pros and cons!!First off I have to say the sound was good when I received it but after a few months it sounds terrible! My daughter probably played with it ten times total, and not for very long! She wasn't too impressed! She's three so I think she got bored with it! I think if had bought it when she was one it would have been a hit!Great for younger kids! I'd say 1-3Very small and heavy ... Won't tip over !Extremely cute and painted very well!The Pink color really stands out and looks beautiful in my daughters room!Sound not so great ...Sound volume is average to low ! Not too noisy !Please let me know if my review has helped you in your inquiry or purchase! Thanks$LABEL$1

Simple, acoustic-esque style with hints of Dido and jazz/blues overtones. Very satisfying purchase. "Colour the Small One" has a simple, near-acoustic rock style which, along with Sia's vocals, are reminiscent of Dido's "Life for Rent" and include many jazz and blues overtones. Guitar, brass instruments, synth organ, and even the xylophone are tastefully blended with both fast and slow percussion in amounts that are often quite complex, yet carefully avoid the "noise rock" effect. Unlike Dido, the lyrical content avoids any edgy or potentially offensive territory, making this album safe for any casual listening audience. Presently lingering near the top of my playlist rotation.$LABEL$1

Labeled 36, but it is a 34 waist - It is a SHAME! I found what exactly is the problem. Be aware!. The Jeans is labeled 36 x 36 but the product for sure is 34 x 36. I cant use it. It does not fit, like all other I have purchased before. Note: I has to change my RATE from Z E R O to O N E Star, otherwise will not show for future buyers....It is a shame, the PANTS don't match the Labeling. 36 waist must be a 36 waist! No respect for the client! Since they are acting this manner it is better to pay more and buy in a store! I dont recommend this product! The problem is that all LEVI'S 501 made in INDONESIA IS SHORT IN THE WAIST AND LEGS ! The MEXICAN MADE ARE OKAY - 100% CORRECT FIT!$LABEL$0

Another bulls-eye. Derber has hit the nail on the head again - in this case it's a bulls-eye, with Bush in the center. But much more important than Bush the individual is Derber's penetrating analysis of the corporate/political elites' control of our democratic processes. By exposing the underlying structure of this control, Derber gives us a meaningful vantage point to understand how the unabashed self-interest of a powerful minority negatigvely impacts the vast majority. I found Derber's upbeat style and witty presentation ultimately hopeful. It's a complicated topic, but this is a readable and important book. We need to wake up ourselves and our country to the reality of what's really happening under Bush (not to mention whoever wins in Nov) - let's demand our leaders and institutions do a much better job of implementing the fundamental ideals and human rights that our country was founded on and that we teach school children to believe in.$LABEL$1

Disappointing.... I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Carr, since this book is such a departure from his historical fiction ("The Alienist," and "The Angel of Darkness"--"The Alienist" is a masterpiece!). I was disappointed in this book. I don't know what Carr was trying to achieve with this novel, but it's a combination of mystery and science fiction that doesn't quite come off, in my humble opinion.It takes place in 2023, and it's mainly about the assassination of the President in 2018. The investigation into it takes the main character, psychiatrist Dr. Gideon Wolfe, through many confusing twists and turns, and I was left confused and wondering what Carr was trying to prove here. It was not easy reading, and it seemed as if the book had been written in haste--there was not the character development nor the detailing one expects from Carr's fiction.$LABEL$0

How do College's get away with this!?. This is a book written by a professor at Ohio University, and it is a required course for Media studies students. He is the only professor who teaches it and of course you are required to use this book. What's even worse is even in it's fifth edition the book is FULL of typos and grammar errors.From the 4th to the 5th edition alone, these typos still have not been corrected, and actually the figures don't add up with the chapters. The book sells for over $100 and is nearly impossible to find used. Shame on Ohio University for allowing this to go on for over 20 years. Absolutely horrible book. Save you're money. Borrow a friends copy of check one out from the library.Btw he doesn't even explain the concepts in a legible way. I've talked to plenty of people in the electronics industry who say McDanniel's definitions and explanations aren't even close to being right, let alone learn-able.$LABEL$0
Good cinematics. Degenerate story.. This movie exhibited interesting cinematic creativity. This visual interest is as far as the movie's value extends unfortunately.There is no redeeming value to the storyline. This movie revels in perversion, sadism, and immorality. This is yet another movie in these troubled times that only adds to the fire and will further twist people's minds.Let's support good, wholesome, uplifting movies and art! When we focus on these things, then people's thoughts will be on these things. Inline attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors then result.Let's not wallow in this filth.$LABEL$0
I feel like I'm caught in a web.... ...a web between 2 Mel Brooks movies that is:) This and 'The Producers'. This movie is one of thoes comedies when while you're watching it you are thinking: "this is so stupid!" but after the movie is over, you think about it a few days later, and start cracking up! My favorite part is probably the end when the camera busts through the wall, that is just too funny! Oh and by the way, if you're a Hitchcock fan, see this movie! If you don't know who Hitchcock is and have never seen his films- then this movie will not be funny to you at all. The only reason I give this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the other Mel Brooks classic- 'The Producers'. I think that 'The Producers' is probably just about the funniest movie ever, and definatley Brooks' best film, with 'High Anxiety' trailing behind:)$LABEL$1
Good reading, but don't expect a business plan in it.. While it can be argued that this book serves as a promotional piece both for Mr. Dell and his company (which isn't a bad and unnexpected thing after all), there's real knowledge to be gained from it. If only Dell Computers human resources is run like the way he describes in part II of the book, his company is light-years ahead from the competition just by using a really down to Earth strategy. Add the kind of efficiency and speed they achieved, and you've got a "Star Wars Episode I: TPM" company against "Battlestar Galactica" competition (sorry couldn't resist, I'm in a SW mood eheh). People who want to know about the company's history and Dell's life will be disappointed, because "Direct from Dell" is more like a book on the "Dell's way of doing business".$LABEL$1

Don't waste your time with this one!. Some people have said that this is an interesting and engrossing book, but I found it to be the very opposite! This book was VERY slow-moving; nearly the most sluggish book I've ever read. Details can enhance a book, or they can bring it down in readibility. This book is filled with the latter. Hal Borland has written some FANTASTIC books, but this is certainly NOT one of them. Fairly well-written and mildly interesting, this one is not worth your time or money.$LABEL$0

Not recommended. I purchased this wireless router hoping to replace my 3 years old LinkSys router. However, after playing with it for several hours, I decided to return it because of the following (using firmware 2.18):1. MAC filtering: Can't make it for wireless only. Once it is enable, it is for both wireless and wired network. This is the MOST annoying part. I mean, why do I want to enable MAC filtering for my wired network???2. Router configuration: Very primitive comparing to my old LinkSys.3. Enable/Disable Wireless: It didn't really disable the wireless network(physically). It shoulded be called "allow/deny all" access instead. Once the wireless is "disabled", it does still broadcast the SSID.4. No way of disabling SSID broadcast for security reasons.Finally, I have to give DLink credit for making upgrade firmware so easy (Web base), which is a big improvement comparing to my old linksys router.$LABEL$0
love it, love it , love it, but where is it?. I have been looking for about two years for this movie. Nobody has it. This proves how good this movie was. I wish they would re-release it. My husband never saw it. You can't even rent it anymore. I loved the part about the pirates. I forgot how well it was written. This was a really great horror story. I just wish I could find it. Great classic!Thanx, Sherry$LABEL$1

If only I could give zero stars.... Yes, it's dumb, but no, it's not funny.And I love lowbrow humor. Like Dumb & Dumber...I laughed my hiney off and I'm no Carey fan. I rented this movie fully expecting something very stupid, and very funny.Well...it's very stupid, I gotta give it that... Only problem is that it never really got very funny. It looked funny from the commercials, but the problem is that those scenes were the ONLY funny parts of the movie. If you saw any commercials or reviews, don't bother renting or (heaven forbid!) buying the movie. You already saw the good parts.I just wanted to poke both of these idiots in the eye after about a half hour. I watched the whole dang movie waiting for it to "get funny"...and it never did. No matter how much I smoked, it just didn't ever get funny. And I usually like watching idiots blunder around!Just do yourself a favor and at least rent it before you buy...this isn't a good flick to buy on the assumption it's gonna be good.$LABEL$0
My daughter loves it!. I bought this because my daughter loves eating watermelon but she has 2 teeth and always bites off chunks and i'm afraid she's going to choke on them. This is a great way for her to still eat it without her choking on it. I recommend it to anyone:)$LABEL$1
Streamlight Stinger Battery. I purchased this battery on Amazon in November, 2009, from another supplier. Much like a couple of the reviews mentioned I received a battery "Made in China". I didn't think much of it at the time. It seemed to charge in the same amount of time and have about the same battery life as the OEM that lasted me numerous years.I have now noticed I get about 10 minutes on a full charge. My old "original" battery lasted me about 10 years and got me around 1 hour of use per charge. This is less than a year old and I have been using the flashlight the same as I always have.Moral of the story, in this case saving money will not be a benefit if you use your flashlight frequently. I will not buy a "Made in China" battery for my stinger ever again.I'm not bashing "Made in China" and I don't normally write reviews, but keep my review in mind when ordering.$LABEL$0

Entertaining. Davy Bowman is growing up during WWII in Illinois and must deal with the changes going on around him. His brother, a pilot trainee joins up... his father, a WWI vet owns the local gas station and they are expected to ration food, rubber, gas, and other precious staples. He and his best friend travel around on their bikes savaging metal for the war effort.This was an entertaining (and educational) story of how a country pitched in to help each other during a time of crisis. I particularly enjoyed reading about the various characters that inhabited the town, and the cantankerous old teacher Miss Titus that put a mousetrap in her purse to thwart the class bully. My only complaint is that this book wasn't longer.Well worth a listen for adults and kids alike.$LABEL$1

Buyer Beware. Not recommended for persons who are: just become Christians; theological beginners.This compilation includes viewpoints supported by the founder of the HIGHLY DISCREDITED Jesus Seminar.Thus the "a priori " assumption is the contents will also be intellectually unfounded and dishonest and far afield from actual long-term studies and assessments.You read this at the risk of your own social, intellectual, and spiritual impairment.$LABEL$0
Up or Down?. Really torn on the movie.I loved the beginning, but found myself wondering right away, "Just how is this a kid's movie?" The plot was just too grown-up. Then they started haphazardly throwing in this random stuff obviously meant to amuse young children. It was uncomfortable.Don't get me wrong. The introduction was engrossing. The animation was great. Most of the characters were genuinely lovable, especially the old man and Kevin. But in the end, it just felt like an ugly patchwork - bits and pieces were extraordinary, but ultimately, everything clashed.For the record, I have no problem with talking animals or nonsense in a children's movie - I even expect them. And I truly love Pixar. But this film just didn't sit right with me. The idea was very adult-minded, and it didn't seem like Disney quite worked out what message they wanted to send to kids. Very confusing.Although I really enjoyed some parts, Up left me feeling down..$LABEL$0

A "must-have" for every weaver's personal library!!!. This book is destined to become one of the great classics for weavers! After 30 years of knowing 'how' to weave . . .

This book is a must-read for every weaver regardless of their experience.$LABEL$1
Weak conglomeration of narratives without much Big Picture. More than anything, this is a collection of first-person interviews with former operatives in OSS during WW2, weakly cobbled together with some uncritical filler narrative. Although there are some brief sections that touch on the broader challenges and decisions of the American intelligence effort, most of it involves repetitive first-person accounts of people hiding in the woods from the Nazis. If that sounds interesting, it isn't. I came away from the book with a modest understanding of what the guys on the ground went through, but with almost no sense of the strategic challenges that sent them there. Having said that, it is an easy read, if only because it is largely devoid of interesting ideas.I would not recommend this to someone who wants to understand the broad sweep of the American intelligence effort in WW2. I would recommend this to someone who has some interest in first-hand accounts of the operatives on the ground.$LABEL$0
cool Buk novelty item. Bring Me Your Love is a 1983 short story by Charles Bukowski. The story itself is above average for Buk and far superior to There's No Business, which is offered by Black Sparrow Press in this same format. The R. Crumb art is very compatible with the tale. It's the story of a man visiting his wife in a mental institution and the conversations that follow. Typical Bukowski subject matter...madhouses, women, sex, booze & not much hope at all. If your shelves are already filled with the real Buk books, I would definitely recommend adding this to your collection. Keep in mind, we are talking about a fifteen page book here! There's not much tohold, hence the great price.$LABEL$1
Bad From the Start. I purchased this product shortly after buying a home with a non-working furnace. I also purchased 2 space heaters from another vendor. The other vendors products have worked as expected (thank god), but the Honeywell space heater was defective from the first. I probably should have dealt with it sooner, but with painting, plumbing, and refinishing floors and all of the chaos that comes with a fixer upper I let it go.It runs well for about 3-5 minutes and then shuts off. I susppect a defective heat turn-off. I called the service number on the bottom of the unit and was told to mail the unit for a replacement. The cost of shipping was to be paid by me. Since this was a cheap unit, and they were going to replace it with another cheap, possibly defective unit, I decided to save the shipping cost and just toss this thing in the trash.$LABEL$0
Timeless magic!. Amazing concert. Being one of my all time favourite bands with or without some of the letters of the alphabet ... CSNY ,CSN or just C&N !

Nice but not good for every day use. I bought this stroller because it looked nice and sturdy. I liked the stroller with air-filled wheels and other features such as brake and wheel-locks. However, this stroller is so cumbersome if you have a compact car. Even with my Acura, I still have to take apart the front wheel to fit the stroller in the trunk. Imagine you have your kid and have to assembly your stroller in a before your walk. It's inconvenient and takes up lots of space in your car's trunk. I was mislead by Amazon description of the stroller that it would fit in trunk of any car. Yes it would fit but you have to take apart the front wheel to make it fit in.$LABEL$0

Not worth the money. I was astounded when the book arrived. It fits in the palm of my hand and is thinner then some of the MP3 players on the market today. Although true to Seuss, the content was disappointing and I found the entries a far stretch at times to fit in to 'success' tips. If you want tips for success, purchase Seuss' "Oh the places you'll go" - That book is worth the money.$LABEL$0
Strong Vacation Read. The two biggest complaints about the book are the existence of stock characters and less than believable plot twists.I found the characters strong. Perhaps they were not multifaceted or three dimensional, but it wasn't like the protagonists had no negative attributes or you had no sympathy for what the chief antagonist, Nicky, must have gone through in life.I am confused by what other reviewers found unbelievable in various plot twists. Biggest plot twists are premised on the fact that organizations, legal or illegal, seek to safeguard their assets in a variety of ways, legal and illegal. Good people make poor choices. None of these are shocking.I tried and failed to read this book traveling on Amtrak with my children, but that was more because of their behavior. I then read it thoroughly in about 4 days. Good read, interesting information, challenging focus. I strongly recommend you read this all at once as there are a lot of twists and turns.$LABEL$1

The BEST Relief from Bee/Wasp/Hornet Stings. We have used this product successfully for nearly two decades. It is easy to use (crush the glass vial inside the plastic dispenser; swab green fluid on sting site) and provides immediate relief from the pain of an insect stings for adults, children, and grandchildren. You may have difficulty finding it in stores. Wal-Mart allegedly carries it. I gave up and ordered 4 cards via amazon.com.IT WORKS ! ! !$LABEL$1

unbreakable carafe, breakable components. I've had mine for about a month and the ring around the screen on the plunger has already come off and doesn't appear to want to go back on. In general, I think the screen/plunger piece does not fit well and lets a lot of air (and grounds!) pass through the ring, no matter how slowly or carefully you press down the plunger.This may be okay for camping trips since the carafe seems very durable, but I do not recommend this for daily home or office use. In fact, this weekend I'll be shopping for a larger and less cheaply built glass coffee press in a brick-and-mortar store.This unit is also very small. If I fill it to capacity I can almost make enough coffee to fill my standard-sized coffee mug.$LABEL$0
Fowl Fans Should Love This One. The third book in the Artemis Fowl series seems a little darker than the first two, but still a fun read. Artemis is brilliant as ever, and pretty much five steps ahead of all the adults of any species he runs into. I liked particularly the development of Julia as a character--a young, take-charge kind woman who does her own thing. The ending is a cliffhanger, leaving you wanting the next book, and quickly, please.$LABEL$1
Mistakes Mistakes and More Mistakes.. That's what this book should be called.Trust me , you don't wanna own this book, you'll just bewasting your money.I'm well beyond disappointed w/ this book.But hey, what do you expect when you're writing a bookabout a version of software that you're obviously not evenusing. How else could I be getting errors about obsolete files?If the files that come w/ the book are obsolete, then the software that made them was an earlier version of max.Thus the reason for the mistakes, max 4 is slightly different.What do all these mistakes mean to the person trying to learnmax 4 ? It means you'll be misguided most of the time and you'llend up pulling out all your hair.I highly recommend not even going near this book! You'll onlybe sorry , like I am. I should've bought the max bible.Shame on me. :($LABEL$0
Powerful stories from another world. I first came across this book while reading Francine Prose's "Reading Like a Writer." She provided a short excerpt from "A Distant Episode" and I was intrigued.That particular story - the first in this collection selected by Bowles - was perhaps the most arresting, but they were all interesting. Each story quickly draws you into an exotic world with characters and settings that are palpable.Perhaps I was most taken in by how different each of the stories seemed to be. From a horrifying, violent descent into obscurity and insanity to a simple collection of letters by a single author. From compact, intense stories to a meandering walk through the life of an older, single woman in a foreign place.These images have stayed with me long after I put the book down.$LABEL$1
Very Disappointed. As a single parent, I was quite excited to order this baby book....but I was horribly disappointed when I received it. Since it is hardbound, it's difficult to remove the pages that are not relevant to me. In addition, the paper was poor quality and the printing looked as if it was produced on a home ink-jet printer. The screen printing on the cover looked as if it was also done at home.I found one that was much higher quality, offered as much flexibility for 1/2 the price. The $40 price tag on this is just ridiculous.While I do think there need to be more baby memory books for alternative families, they do need to be high quality and offer the flexibility to remove irrelevant pages. My situation didn't speak to any of those covered in the book.Also, let's be realistic....do you really think you're going to fill this out until your child is in 12th grade?$LABEL$0
A Watery Snoozefest. Following a trip to the top of Everest in "Into Thin Air," I immediately plunged right into "Perfect Storm," naively expecting the same kind of drama. How wrong I was. Like many other reviewers listed here, I found the author's annoying attention to technical detail to be very distracting from the story at hand. And many times, I forgot which boat I was on, who owned it and why we were being asked to care about it. All in all, a major disappointment. Better luck next time.$LABEL$0
Basta cosi!! (Enough already!!). The book started off as a charming discourse on life in Tuscany, but I found myself by the first third of the book yelling, "per l'amor del cielo - for the love of god - quit going on and on re. the perfect tomato and eat the f**king thing already!!$LABEL$0
Lame...Boring, Too much ... Circus Benny Hill Music. I have already watched the new 2009 version and really liked it. This original version is boring, i actually fell asleep 4 times. I had to stop it and come back to watch the rest the next day. This is supposed to be a horror/thriller movie, but then the benny hill type circus soundtrack is horrible. Some of the scenes are even humorous, like the police officers trying to hitchhike after they ran out of gas. The new modern version is much better. Oh ... and what's with their daughter refusing to wear a bra and showing her breasts in front of her father ... ? That was creepy.$LABEL$0

Excellent and Realistic Literature. This autobiography gives new meaning to the word realistic. It is funny, sad and gruesome at times. Obviously, this book does appeal to the wrestling ethusiasts, but I recommend all read it. It brings new light to the so-called "fake" sport of wrestling. I believe those who read it will gain a new respect for wrestlers, considering the time and effort they devote to the profession they love. Overall, the book is great. Surprisingly, all those shots to the head did not affect Mankind's literary talents. The generally summarizes the life of Mankind from the time he was eighteen to now. It reveals many secrets of the profession and discusses his long and hard rode to the top of the sport. I personally suggest all should give it a try and I promise all will be pleased.$LABEL$1

Homeport disappoints. The title is good. The book is not! Interesting careers in crime and art mesh in this very predictable read. However, the plot is miserable and the outcome expected from page two. The book is very detailed when it comes to the sexual experiences of the characters, embarrassingly so. Too much emphasis on the unnecessary. If you have nothing else to read... this will do. Otherwise select another book. Just because it looks good, doesn't make it so.$LABEL$0

No comparison to other great songwriters, ie Ryan Adams. I bought both of these albums after all of the hype surrounding them and I am thoroughly disappointed with both efforts. He continuously sounds off key, his song structure is an unpleasant listening experience and he is overly hyped as a new Dylan when in fact, he doesn't even compare to Ryan Adams or other great, young musicians in this category. Pick up any Ryan Adams cd (or Whiskeytown) and you'll know what I mean, just no comparison. Both of these cd's weren't worth my money or time.$LABEL$0

Horrible Book. I ordered this because it was compared to Mary Higgins Clark. There is no way this book or author could compare to MHC. Although the storyline sounded interesting, it not only drags on with an endless history lesson given by the characters, but one would get the impression that everyone in the 1500's was either gay or had no moral character whatsoever. The language and sexual content in this book is not something I want or should be needed in a successful novel. Mary Higgins Clark has been writing books for more years than I can count, and she has never needed to put smut or language in her books to have them pouring off the shelf. After reading about 1/2 of the book, and getting way too many sexually explicit pictures in my head, I had had enough, and decided to forget trying to finish it. Too bad you can't get a 'money-back-guarantee' on books.This author has alot of work to do to present a book with decent substance.$LABEL$0

Are You Kidding? This Album is Terrible. Not much to say on this one, so I'll make it quick. If you're a fan of Mother Goose rappers who can't come up with their own stuff, then Nelly is your man. If he's not stealing rhymes from the movie "Big" (Country Grammar chorus), then he's stealing Old McDonald Had a Farm (Old McDonald had a farm, E.I. E.I. Uh Ohhhh). If you want rap music you can listen to with your parents, then go buy "A Tribe Called Quest", at least they are originators. Personally, I don't think there should be any rap albums you can listen to with your parents, they're supposed to not like your music, just like my parents hate mine. Plain and simple, don't buy Country Grammar, it's trash.$LABEL$0

Thoroughly Entertaining!!!!!. I recently came across Terror in the Aisles in my local video store and rented it thinking it was a different movie. What I got was an awesome compilation of some of the older, classic horror films.Terror in the Aisles is hosted by the Late Great Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen. They take us through over 70 horror flicks in just under 90 minutes. Some of these movies include, Halloween, Jaws, Friday the 13th, Psycho, Carrie, The Exorcist, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just to name a few. Also, there is a brief appearance by, the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock. There were also a few movies which I have not seen that look particulary interesting such as, When a Stranger Calls and Nighthawks.If your a fan of horror movies then you must see Terror in the Aisles it's well worth a look.$LABEL$1
The worst film I ever saw. I'm an avid fan of campy zombie and slasher films, but this is the worst I have ever seen. Bad acting, poor videography, amateur special effects .... the list goes on.

Not as good as I thought it would be. I saw all the positive reviews and one review stating that it was better than the Leaf (basically the two I narrowed it down to) and I was disappointed after buying the TREK. I'm on the 4th floor (top) of my building in Miami, FL and I have the antenna pointing directly at the towers (about 25 miles away). I only get three channels. I don't get CBS, NBC or anything pertinent except FOX. Pretty much useless.UPDATE: 9/18/2012I bought the LEAF PLUS and it worked a bit better than the Trek. It is WAY more aesthetic though. The trek is too bulky. I used the LEAF at my fathers house as a test and was able to get over 20 channels. At my apartment I only get about ten so take that into consideration on my initial review.In the end, the LEAF PLUS is the winner.$LABEL$0
Good electric kettle. I had used one in the past and was very pleased with it so I ordered this one. It's an excellent kettle with one flaw. The base of the kettle has changed and not for the good. The top of the base that I used before was flat. This one is rounded and the kettle has some little "feet" that are totally useless so the kettle doesn't really sit solidly on the base. Other than that I would have given it 5 stars.$LABEL$1
"Religious Fanatics Can Make It Be All Gone...". Still as good today as it was 20 yrs ago. Frank has this uncanny ability to create music that lasts throughout the generations. From women in the military to deadheads looking for freedom from their parents, this album hits hard. Frank pokes and prods the religious right with heavenly bank account, the meek shall inherit nothing and the classic Dumb all Over(Maybe W should listen to this one!!!) Does humor belong in music? Absolutely, and no one does it better and with the worlds most amazing band than FZ!!!$LABEL$1

The best book I read on preparing to have a new baby. The book focuses on the most important relationship to a baby--how the parent's relate to each other after the first child is born. The stability and love (or lack thereof) in the parental relationship creates the environment in which the child is raised. Men and women have different expectations and reactions to the birth of a child. This book is a long-term case study of what types of marriages grow stronger, stay the same or get weaker as a result of the birth of a child. The insights I gained helped me to modify and be aware of issues in my marriage that having children creates. I believe my marriage has grown stronger after children and part of the reason was the insight gained from this book.$LABEL$1

A Classic!. When A Christmas Story first came out in the early 1980's I saw it three times because I kept dragging friends to view it. I bought a video copy when it came out on VHS; and I bought the DVD version when it came out a few years ago. This current DVD edition is the best yet. Compared to the orginal DVD, which I looked at for the sake of comparison, this 2003 edition has a much clearer image, better color, and a more balanced contrast. Although I have not been able to find any statement verifying my conclusion, I feel strongly the film has been digitally remastered for this special edition. As a result viewing this classic is more of a pleasure and delight than ever. I am very grateful for the fine technical job that Warner Brothers did on this release.$LABEL$1
Great Game!. This is a great game! I played the RPG for years and found that this console game caught the essence of the game completely. You can read the descriptions of the game from the other people that posted here. I wish there was a current, more expanded version of this game, I would soooooo buy it.$LABEL$1

A Tad Disappointed. While I am a big fan of Ms. Moore and have been since she arrived on the music scene, the addition of hubby and fellow crooner Kenny Lattimore could have been left off. To me, her voice has always been strong and overshadows Kenny's. The concept of for lovers (always a good theme) kinda left me hanging on this CD because except for the title track (the best on the CD) and Loveable (From Head to Toe), the CD is remakes. I would have thought that these 2 contemporaries would have come up with original material. I really hate to give the CD 2 stars because my love for Chante but I heard nothing other than what was mentioned earlier that made me go Wow. For those considering the purchase of this CD, be forewarned - if you don't like remakes, this is not the CD for you.$LABEL$0

Scratchy. Got these and when I opened I thought they were a bit rough. Washed and then washed again. I feel like I am back to my college days when I wasn't concerned about thread count and got the cute sheets. Swear these feel like a 200 thread count sheet. I like the color and hope they soften more with washings.$LABEL$0

A Masterpiece. This dvd is so good that you should not waste time reading this review. Just get it. Yeah it's that awesome. The animation is far beyond most contemporary anime. The character are beautifully drawn with incredible detail and the colors are so vivid that the environments seem to come alive. Besides the technical aspects the story is complicated, but very enjoyable. The action is fantastic. Kenshin deals with his foes in a savage yet graceful manner that causes your draw to drop while the blood gushes. This dvd has something for everybody the only problem is that it may make most of the other stuff you've seen look like Garbaaggee.$LABEL$1
Basic story-telling - not what I'd want. Seybold tells us a lot of stories and examples, but does not include concrete information on how or what should be done in order to really build an customer centric e-business.As a basic, first time introduction it maybe okay - but please don't use this as your guide to building a business. Many better books out there - look for customer care / customer service keywords.$LABEL$0

Maxell CD-392 Double Slim-Line Jewel Cases. These are great cases.

too different from the earlier edition. I came across a very early edition of this book and thought it was great, but it was out of print. I thought that this book would be similar but there were major differences. While the earlier edition provided extensive word lists organized around the consonants, this book was organized around vowels. The only word lists that were based on consonants were much shorter in comparison. Although I sent the book back and can't reference it, I seem to remember that they were around 15 to 20 words long. Also, while the words in the earlier edition were useful for adults, the words in this later edition seemed to be geared toward children. For me, the book went back, although someone who is focused on vowels and working with children would probably find it useful.$LABEL$0
Worst taste ever!. Frankly this product didn't even deserve a one star. Less than one star! The taste and smell was the absolute worst! I tried it in juice also in hopes of making it drinkable but to no avail. This product should honestly be taken off the shelves!$LABEL$0
massively overrated. Rick Linklater brought this movie off on a shoestring budget: it follows, without a story, the various reflections of residents in the student ghetto area of UT Austin.I've always thought this movie was greatly overestimated: there are some good lines, but not really "dialogue." Pretty much all the characters talks the same: like Richard Linklater, presumably. It's really just a continuous, occasionally amusing monologue that simply drifts from one character to another.Linklater went on to do some legitimately good films, but this one, his third film, hardly deserves the massive study edition that this Criterion Collection edition is.$LABEL$0

below average word list. I used this workbook level C for both my average in spelling 4th grader and above average in spelling 3rd grader. The children commented many times about how simple the words were. In fact they were much to simple! This would be a good workbook if you are looking to give your child "busy work". However, unless your child is really having a hard time with spelling you don't want this! The word list are below grade level! It was a waste of time and money. Even on the last lesson list words are much to simple. They are words like hear, your, to, our, great...etc$LABEL$0
Best Green Day CD. This CD is just so cool. All of the songs just have so much substance. It's so fantastic. I love the lyrics and the tune of the songs. I love how they did different things on this album. The way that they put so many different instruments in is totally cool. I agree that each song could stand as its own album. It's just the best album that I have heard in a long time. I suggest you buy this immediately.$LABEL$1

Silly and stupid. Both my wife and I are into gaming, but not this type of dress-up/act out gaming.Unlike some other reviewers here, I didn't think the "players" gave it their all. They were ignoring "game decorum" every 10 seconds or so, so it really made everyone look half-hearted and silly. There were a few comedic moments here and there which were ok, but the drama was totally uninteresting. Maybe there is a good story here somewhere, but neither my wife nor I could get into this film.A big thumbs down for us!$LABEL$0
this book is extremly borring exept of the last 5 chapters. this books keeps giving more and more unnececary information to a point where i was ready to give up the book. when the plot starts to roll it`s a good book! but to read 17 chapters -\+ for a good 5 it doesnt worth it . keep it to a really desperet times!!$LABEL$0
Way Over-hyped. As a lifelong Beach Boys fan I had hoped SMILE would live up to the billing and hype of the reviewers...was I wrong!I recall listening to many of these silly songs while in college in the early 70's on the SMILEY SMILE ambum. Nothing profound here for sure. PET SOUNDS is the Beach Boys masterpiece that deserves all the adulation and hype one can bestow...it is truly a brilliant symphony of youthful hopes, dreams, and emotions. Recently I've gained a new appreciation for Dennis Wilson's songs before his demise, perhaps as heartfelt and deep as any Beach Boy explored. Forever.$LABEL$0
You get what you pay for!. Inova produced products for HSN and they touted lifetime warranty etc. Just try for customer service----does not exist.

My Guide To The Movie Guide. This guide was great I loved it. This Book has an Intruduction written by Viggo Mortenson. This Guide is filled with pictures of sences from the movie and parahagraphs to explian them. It gives some information that isn't clear in the second movie and is important information that will build up events in the third movie. This guide gives you backround information on some of the charactors in the movie. Such as gollum, Faramir, The ents, and many other charactors in the movie. It also tells you about places in Middle-earth such as The Dead Marshes, Ithilien, and ect.This guide also shows you how battle scences happen and how they are created. I give this guide a 5-star.$LABEL$1
Left Behind. I couldn't put this book down. It read like a novel and captured my interest from the very beginning. Has wonderfully thought out characters while slowly unfolding the book of revelations. The book is so easy to read you almost forget that it is based on the bible. This book will captivate any reader and will excited them about the book of revelations and Christ's second coming. Don't be left behind!$LABEL$1
Unable to get a replacement.. My Blu Ray case arrived broken down the side of case. Where the case be ds is was broken all the way down. You can't open my case without it dropping all of the discs out. I looked into getting a replacement, but I'd only get my money back and have to repurchase the product. It would have been about $10 more. I love the show and am just keeping it with the case broken. I just wish I could have exchanged my product is all.$LABEL$0
Better on the radio. With songs like "Still of the Night," "Here I Go Again," and "Don't Turn Away" I figured this album would be one awesome album. Every song seems to be the same, all about love, but for some strange reason it only works on the above songs. The other 6 songs on the album are decent enough to listen to but they just don't rock.1 great song, 2 good songs, and 6 mediocre songs do not = a good album.$LABEL$0
Fascinating!. Filled with lush description of Venice during Carnivale, its political and social structure, the inner workings of the opera company and Tito's relationships with his family, friends, colleagues and himself, this is a rich, wonderful book. I also found it a good mystery with a couple of twists and some good suspense. This is a series I shall definitely follow.$LABEL$1

go listen b4 you buy!!!. Opposite of his previous work! Of course I wasn't as exited as Get Rich Or Trying Dying to buy the CD for I had a feeling it would be a bad one.

I would recommend people to listen to the CD b4 buying it.$LABEL$0
Nice Product. I've never owned one of these before, but it is high quality. Glass is thick and smooth with handy measurement markers. There are drink recipes also on the glass, but I have not used any of these. High quality stainless steel cup, does not leak if used correctly. Strainer is also stainless, high quality and works well.$LABEL$1
Useable Recipes for Busy People. Opening this book, I found a layout of table arrangements, alluring food photographs, Paris cookware shops, and recipes so common that I just wasn't sure anyone would need another book on these classics. Yet, to my sweet surprise, after examining the book closer, and cooking some of the dishes; I found a lovely and very useful book. Ina Garten has put together a choice collection of French classics that fit the American palate. In an easy cooking format, she's modified recipes to fit busy schedules, but seriously the dishes hold their flavor and are well thought out. I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted to cook French food; especially time deprived cooks. Its recipes take you to the market for fresh produce; allowing you to feel how simple a dish can be, yet so gourmet at the same time. Barefoot In Paris shows what's really going on in home kitchens set out over the beautiful countryside of France, and that simply put; is great cooking!$LABEL$1
The best!!!!!. These knives are the best steak knives that I have ever used. They cut through steak like butter. Treat these knives well and they will last you a life time.

Wat is this book about?. I could not figure this book out. I love Anna Griffin papers but this book is just a haze of pretty pictures. It gave no real useful information on how to be a better scrapbooker or even how to scrapbook in the "Anna Griffin" style. Not my cup of tea.$LABEL$0

Awful. Possibly the worst casebook ever written.

Horrible implementation of great product. This product is Wonderful and Terrible. It's extremely frustrating that it isn't better implemented. As many are trying to increase their intake of fresh vegetables, this product makes it so much easier. The downsides are - It appears to be made with a polycarbonate plastic which contains BPA and I'm assuming it contains that. The other complaint is that the water reservoir leaks all over the counter. I'd be thrilled to pay $80.00 for this product or more if it were just made better. The timer and keep warm features are great. Vegetables have never tasted so good or been more convenient. Please fix this and increase the price.$LABEL$0
Only good if you are incredibly out of shape!. After my first two years in college, I wanted to lose some of the weight I had gained. This DVD was cheap and I needed to tighten up my arms so I bought it. All I can say is I did this about twice and now it's collecting dust. Like another reviewer said, it is boring and the instructor talks way too much. I'm really not used to working out a lot, especially my arms but I found this too easy and way too boring. They definitely could have cut out some of the talking and made it quicker. It would be good to do if you only have a couple minutes but the lengthiness of it due to unnessecary talking makes that impossible. For 35 minutes, I expect to get a more worthwhile workout.$LABEL$0
Boring...Boring...Boring!!. The 5 star review was obviously given by the author Mr Lauria as he is trying to pump the sales of this book just like he pumped and dumped stocks. Sal Lauria is nothing short of a weasel who ratted out his childhood friends and others just so he can keep his little tooshy out of jail.There is no reason to buy this book.......it is a horrible read and only helps out a rat.$LABEL$0
I Don't See Why People Like This. I'm sorry, but I really don't! It's a style called Celtic Drama, which means it's a combination of stories w/o words and traditional Irish Dancing.I've never been a Michael Flatley person.Parts of this are traditional Irish dancing, but other's aren't anywhere near it! There are also long songs, sort of like a choir piece. I don't like those at all.If you want to see traditional Irish dancing, this is not your movie.$LABEL$0
Fun read. This book was great. The writing made me feel like I was watching an actual episode. It takes place in the third season before "Bad Girls" so Faith is involved. I loved everything about the book except that Faith say "B" like every other sentence :) But I can live with that.$LABEL$1

Disappointment. I am an avid Jodi Picoult reader. This is the first of her's that did not have me staying up late to read more. In fact, this is the first of her's that took me more than a few days to read.

Worked as advertised. Just replaced the cartridge on my Samsung ML-3051N laser printer and found that it worked just as advertised in terms of output. Using the toner saver function (about 99% of the time) on the printer I printed approximately 20 pages per day over a 10 month period which comes out to about 6000 pages. Samsung estimates that you can get about 5600 pages with this cartridge with the toner saver function. Not too bad for a cartridge rated at 4000 pages at normal toner setting.The cartridge worked consistently right up to the end. No complaints.$LABEL$1

The Gallant Old Engine and Other Thomas Stories. It is a very good video. See what Stuart and Falcon do when Duke is sick, and Duncan learns that passengers are important. See Skarloey tell Peter Sam and Duncan about Rheneas pulling his passengers home in a big storm, and see what Henry does when an elephant is stuck in a tunnel. See what happens when Duck and Henry pull The Flying Kipper, and when Percy pushes some freight cars in to Bulstrode the Barge and what else happens.The story stops are; Henry and the Elephant; You Can't Win; Special Attraction; Passengers and Polish; The Gallant Old Engine; Fish; and the Music Video "Really Useful Engine".This is a good video. I know yuo'll like it.$LABEL$1
Perfect Gift!. Coming from someone who knows nothing about golf. I bought this for my father in law for Christmas, who is an avid golfer. He absolutely loved this. It was the gift of the night. He wouldn't put it down. The pictures are great quality, and the little bit of it that I did read was very interesting. I personally think this is a must have for any golf lover. Makes a great coffee table book.$LABEL$1

uplifting harmonies. The first three tracks on this cd alone will make you happy you purchased it. Beatitudes starts with "blessed are.." and no matter how bad your case of the blues, you will raise your head by the end of the song. Run, Run, Mourner Run showcases not only the separate harmonies working together but a playful interaction with the live audience as well. Wade in the Water is a fluid, soulful rendition of this church song. All of the good reasons you might go to church are contained in these songs. The cd continues with adventurous harmony, political statements and rises to climactic endings as in Our Side Won. No one can beat their arrangements and voices working together - truly the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. And in this case the parts are excellent as well.$LABEL$1

Fun and durable. My now 8 year old grand-daughter received this as a gift when she was two. She used it a bit but this toy has gone on to get much use from my now 5 yo and 3 year old grandsons.

It's been outdoors for most of six years in New England and although a bit faded the boys are happy to play with it again this year. I would highly recommend it to anyone who may be interested.

Misleading information on amazon. The original book, although impossible to find is a stellar resource to have and I highly recommend it.

Impossible to find refills for this dumb mop. The Quickie web site says that the HomePro mop (model 041) uses the 0472 & 0473 mop refills, which are "Type H." Amazon tells a different story? Who's right? I have definitely wasted more than 2 hours of my life getting the wrong refills at Safeway and my local hardware store.The best use for this mop, as far as I can tell, is to take this mop and smash my computer screen, because my only choice before contributing more waste to the landfill is to take a gamble and buy the refill that Amazon wants me to buy--the Type J--which is not the manufacturer recommended Type H refill. Even writing this review is a waste of my time. I feel this mop has aged me by at least 20 years. Cruel world. I just want to clean my floors.$LABEL$0
Surprisingly lackluster. This album is definitely a new sound for Roena. Unfortunately I don't think this new sound went well for him since it really sounds generic and nothing really stands out in this album. The only track I found good was "Hablame Mi Amor", which was still does not have a remotely equal effect as "Tu Loco Loco" or "Avisale a Mi Contrario." This is one Roena album I would skip. Only good reason to buy would be to complete a collection.$LABEL$0

Loved It. Everyone that has commented seem to think the movie was awful.. Me on the other hand has never watched the Avartar Airbender cartoon.. So maybe I don't know what it should have or shouldn't have been .. But I really enjoyed the movie.. And i'm a strong movie buff of any Fantasy Movie as long as their is a story line.I actually hope their is a 2 on the horizon. And any way it was only for entertainment.. Not to build my life on.. So i give it a big thumbs up and to me the special effects was awesome.The actors did a good job on bringing to movie to life. I wasn't trying to pick the movie a part but to enjoy the movie. But then thats just my opinion. I would recommen you watching it and forming your own opinion.$LABEL$1

The first attempt at a modern biography of St. Francis. Now in a new edition edited and with an introduction and annotation Jon Sweeny, The Road To Assisi: The Essential Biography of St. Francis was first published in French in 1894, as the first attempt at a modern biography of St. Francis, one of the most beloved figures of Christian history. Author Paul Sabatier struggled to answer the question: who was Francis the man? Groundbreaking research reveals the a fully human portrayal of a man who was nonetheless gentle, passionate, joyful, and who desired to live as Jesus once taught his disciples. An extraordinary work that covers Francis' weaknesses as surely as his strengths, enhanced by the annotation and sidebars that place events of Francis' life in historical context. Highly recommended for individual reading as well as biography shelves, and a must-have for library collections.$LABEL$1

Great Cd!!!. I don't think comparing this cd to it's past ones is fair. I think this cd is really great. I had to get it before I went on vacation. But still something is bugging me a bit, it isn't very ska. They pride themselves on being ska, and yet there cd doesn't sound very ska to me. Where is the trumpets? It is still a great cd. Probably my favorite in my cd collection right now. I think it deserves 4 stars, it is wonderful, but missing the ska feel and style. Over all it is a great cd!!!$LABEL$1

Quite Mediocre. I only purchased it because I was in downtown Phoenix for a conference and couldn't find a real book store within walking distance. I was stuck with the hotel's W.H. Smith and the NY Times bestseller list (blech.)This book is a fast, pleasant read. The early portions were quite promising, evoking a feeling of creeping doom. I also liked the sprinkles of social commentary, particularly the discrimination fathers face in custody proceeedings.However, the plot quickly became utterly -- and I mean utterly -- predictable. The only suspense left for me was seeing just how long it would take the main character to figure out what I had figured out, and details of the resolution.

I was extremely happy when I saw AVATAR in the list. When it arrived and we started to watch it we found this is NOT 3D. Very disappointed in the deceptive marketing of Amazon.com but let's face it, the bottom line is the paramount issue.$LABEL$0
Brilliant. Many might feel with this effort that Welsh is merely rehashing Trainspotting...in fact all of the major characters from that story make a brief appearance in Glue. Nevertheless, though Welsh's familiar themes of drug abuse, sex and delinquency abound, Glue is a story about people.The book details the life of four close friends growing up in Scotland from the 1970s into the new millenium...through troubles and joys. It is a fun read told with Welsh's unrestrained yet stylish flair. The human element is very strong here...we see the four friends in every light; what brings them together, what drives them apart and ultimately the tragedy that they must all overcome. It is a sad and beautiful story, yet more upbeat than some of Welsh's previous works. Personally, I think it is his finest. If you enjoyed Welsh's other efforts, definitely pick this one up today. It is worth every page.$LABEL$1
noisey. Had to send it back. It had a disturbing crackling sound that didn't lull me to sleep...just the opposite. However, the return procedure went smoothly. UPS picked it up and we had our money back within days.$LABEL$0
Dragged down by a boring story and poor writing. It seems that around the late 90s, Koontz was developing a rather wordy, pompous writing style. This book, along with False Memory, is bogged down by puzzling analogies, irritating metaphors, and questionable word usage. We all know Koontz is a great writer, but at this point he begins showing off too much, which is really off putting.Despite the above, a Koontz novel can be saved by a compelling plot. This book doesn't even have one, however. The mystery surrounding this tale is hardly intriguing, and it's a struggle to maintain interest throughout this book.Only read if you feel the need to round out Koontz's bibliography.$LABEL$0
Boring. This movie is one hour and twenty-one minutes long and was released on January 1984. As for a plot there is none. A few breasts scenes and some sword action but that is it. The only thing that it has going for it is that it has stars Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson. Rent it; don't buy it.$LABEL$0
It will infect your very soul! (4.5 stars). Spiritualized make it 2 releases in a row to make it to my annual best of list.Let It Come Down, much like 1997's Ladies and Gentlemen..., has all the beauty and deep passion Mr. Pierce can muster. It floats through the air with rousing gospel choir choruses, thunderous horns and big guitars, all set against his familar dreamy backdrop of orchestration and melodies.The first single, Stop your crying, can almost trick you into thinking this is a far more simple release. But as with all of the Spiritualized catalog, good things come to those who wait... 4 or 5 minutes. Each track is as haunting as the one before, as gripping as a drugged man yearning for a companion.Achingly beautiful.$LABEL$1
Scuba Smurf. I really like this goofy toy. There's about zero educational value to it, but as a diver, I like that this smurf wears a fairly accurate rendition of real scuba gear. It just seems pretty cool, especially with the release of the recent Smurf Movie.$LABEL$1
A reply to Carlson. The book is an edited collection of essays protesting what its authors regard as the undue hegemony of liberal/progressive/PC ideology in clinical psychology. Many of the opinions expressed are reasonable, well supported by fact, and long overdue. Meanwhile, even those I find wrongheaded are largely to the left of Fox News, the WSJ editorial page, and Mussolini. The citations in Roger Carlson's review are caricatures of what is actually said; for this the only remedy is to read the book and draw your own conclusions. Like Carlson, I am a clinical psychologist (and yellow-dog Democrat), yet he strikes me as the sort of doctrinaire zealot who could easily end up in Hell sharing a room with Karl Rove.$LABEL$1
No Protection. The clip provides no protection at all to scratches or accidental drop. I scratched my brand new Treo 300 surface badly the first day I put around my belt by accidently rubbing against furniture. It has already been dropped once from the holster, since the tiny plastic cip at the top is not secure. I am shopping for a new case now! Not recommended for people on the go.$LABEL$0
The best Beethoven I ever heard. The Furtwängler's performance of Beethoven's Fifth is simply the best I ever heard. The interpretation is powerful, full of passion and intensity. The sound is quite good for a 1954 recording, and the Vienna Philharmonic plays as well as usually. If you really like Beethoven's Fifth, you must have this recording. The 7th interpretation is also very good, but the sound is not so good. But the allegretto sounds so beautifuly! A really good performance!$LABEL$1

I was very pleased.... I don't understand why this movie isn't more popular. It, honestly, is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while. It definitely kept me on the edge of my seat and it definitely kept me captivated. Everything is really good: the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the music, everything. Kate Greenhouse plays her role perfectly and Paul Fox does a great job putting this film together. And the plot is simple yet it's really creative (the twists totally caught me off guard). All in all, if you're looking for a thriller, this is one of the better ones out there.$LABEL$1
A soon to be cult classic.. J. Todd Anderson's second directorial debut is a raucous good time. This campy but funny movie is well worth the price of this DVD. There are zippy one-liners, homages to the Three Stooges, and some very memorable characters. If you just want to have a great movie watching experience get My Mummy.$LABEL$1
Very enjoyable, recommended for people who love words. Poplollies and Bellibones-My friends and family collect and share words and this a book that's worth hours of discussion and joy. A mix of words, some of them with very precise meanings that don't have a modern equivalent in common use, others more that are more general. It also has a bit of the history of some of the words including the etymology and time period.The illustrations are very 70s style and the words are placed in a narrative context with notes about what each italicized word means.Tenderfeet and Ladyfingers by the same author has the origin of many phrases in use today, as well as more historical words. It's a fun mix of things relating to body parts in rich, descriptive and fun language.$LABEL$1

Wonderful novel about life today!. The cover of "Autumn Leaves..." caught my attention and before I even knew what the book was about I knew I had to have it. I was by no means disappointed. This is a wonderful novel about love and friendship, life and death. There were many times in the course of reading that I was cheering, clapping, yelling and crying. The main characters were portrayed vividly from the sweetness of Legacy to the horrendous Simpson. I felt Marshall's grief and Jasmine's betrayal. This book touched on social issues that we all deal with today such as instant wealth from playing sports, unprotected sex and how AIDS impacts on so many people. This book is a must read. You won't be disappointed.$LABEL$1
Polish my demo. I bought this CD on the strength of the two downloadable tracks here on amazon, and that other people bought it with purchases that I also have. It's pretty dissapointing: the synth choices are on the clunky side, the drum tracks are unimaginative, the male vocal is weak -- the staple and bane of synth bands, it seems -- but the female vocal is arranged so badly it is funny. Some nice melodies there, but nothing groundbreaking or energetic. Only the last three tracks of disc two made me sit up.What this thing seems to need most is a good producer who can take this material to the next level. Right now it just sounds like really accomplished home-made demos.$LABEL$0
Rip-off. I had this product already in my cart when I noticed the low rating. Curiosity led me to the reviews and the price!I quess I tend to get complacent and just click "add to cart". That is going to change. As other reviewers commented this kind of pricing is robbery! Also, Amazon should do more to control the vendors they allow to use their site. Amazon's reputation is also affected by this sort of thing.It's a lot cheaper to use the gas to drive to the supermarket!

I've been SITTING in front of my computer since I put it on and it reads 141 steps so far and I have it on the lowest sensitivity level.More importantly, the tip of my right thumb is killing me from wrestling with the lid to get it open.

Like a long cold drink on a hot day. Because my Parents raved about Joe and this book I was leary of it's contents. I soon ate all my words. This book is slow the first few pages. Once I got into it, the story is fluid. I found my self lost in a world of drugs, lust, friendship and trauma. I highly recommend the book to anyone who either grew up different or in Minneapolis. Either way this will hit home... Being your self and being true to that is. Vivid characters and a wait and see outlook make a great combination. I can't explain it, just read it. Some naughty sex, but hell it was good.$LABEL$1

Cheezy rape fantasy.... I think the movie should've been titled either "Sorrow Man" or "Jealousy Woes". What in God's name were they thinking? Those effects took hours, days, weeks, months, FOREVER! And all for what? So we can learn that an invisible "genius" can get jealous and kill all his friends? Well, I can't say I expected anything more from the director of Showgirls and Basic Instinct. On second thought, maybe I did a little, because I enjoyed Total Recall and Starship Troopers. (And just between you and me, I liked both Showgirls and Basic Instinct. Shhh.)The score is better than the film. And, you know what? The special effects here are overrated. Stupid cartoon CGI. 'Hollow Man' is just another ret@rded mess puked out from the bowels of "Hollow"wood.$LABEL$0
As Good As It Can Be..... This season was as good as it could have been with Steve's departure.I did enjoy all the twists and turns throughout.If this were a "pilot" season for the show and we knew that there never was a Michael Scott, this would have been a decent first season....But, after saying that, there is definitely something that is still missing from this season....Good but not great.$LABEL$1
1 star is generous. I am a JL fan and I would like to say that I have read all of her books. Unfortunately, I could not even finish this one. When I saw that it was rated 5 stars I flipped out. This book was terrible. Maybe I am not a futuristic type of woman but please!!! Also, the sequels to this book are just as terrible if not worse. Couldn't finish those either. Sorry, I would have given this 0 stars if there was that option! 1 star is generous!$LABEL$0
WHITE OLEANDER. White Oleander, is one of the most captivating novels I have had the pleasure to read. Astrid, a stranded, young girl is left in foster care when her haunting and poisonous mother is put in prison for murder. As Astrid travels from foster home to foster home without the one thing she has grown to know and be, her mother, she realizes how trapped she really was. Astrid learns what it is to be frree and who she really is. I truly think that this is one of the most heartwrenching novels I have ever read. I think this novel gives you a better idea of how lucky we all are to have what we have.$LABEL$1
Closure?. Dated production quality, solid story (up to the end if you read between the lines), and a cast of characters with... well... character.Shinji (agreeing with others who have posted here) is pathetic... but arguably lovable...Closure on the story is not what ends this work. The close of the story is something like a statement of life...Life is... what you make of it...Plain and simple...For overall anime quality, I like it.For overall delivery, the message was clear to those looking for the message.For overall story, it has a definite apocalyptic/rainbow at the end of the tunnel feel (Though like a rainbow you only see it but can't touch it).I would buy it again if I lost my copy.$LABEL$1
A is for Angel. "A is for Angel with shining white wings...."This is a wonderful book I remember so well from my childhood.

Unsuccessful Self-Imitation.. Volume one and 826+ - she did it big time and made me a huge fan of hers.. but it seems shes trying to recreate the past but..despite my effort to love this new album it really s*>cks.All you fans out there praise everything she does... but be honest with yourselves.. every song sounds the same, and like every other artist out there. I strongly recommend jill's fans to not approach this one so you can be left with the sweet taste of the past.hearing the love shmaltz over and over again makes you sick, and it seems as if her label know this album is lame so they put all the PR on "Golden" which is the only loveable-reminds-the-past track.Zack.$LABEL$0

Thor - Another Gem in the Marvel Series. Thor is a movie that has to be looked at on a number of levels. The action and effects is outstanding. The movie scenes are rich in design and colors projecting an art deco version of Valhalla. The action scenes are loaded with drama and in some cases with elements of humour. What is unexpected is underlying theme of loss and redemption, a raw callous youth coming to understand responsibility is all about. Thor's banishment to Earth, his realization of loss, and his redemption through being to willing to sacrifice his life to preserve planet is a theme one does not expect in a live action comic book. Thor works on all levels. There may be a few problems with the script and some parts that should have gone on the cutting room floor but overall a very enjoyable flic.$LABEL$1
A very good performance. Klemperer always works wonders with Bruckner, bringing out the warmth and musicality of the piece. This version is a little slow, but this symphony is supposed to take its time. If one plays it too rapidly, a lot of the inner melodies and colorations get lost. You won't go wrong with this recording.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because Klemperer's versions of the Bruckner Sixth and Fourth (the latter with the Bavarian Radio Symphony - not the studio recording) are just so outstanding that they are in another realm.$LABEL$1
Lorre us what makes Moto. I really liked this box set. Not only are the films thrilling and fun to watch, but the Extras make it a must to have in ones collection.

REAL information with REAL facts. This is a great book and a MUST for every parent. This shows the truth that doctors don't want you to know, because then they wouldn't get those lovely bonuses from the makers of the vaccines. Of course this ISN'T a conspiracy theory book but actually scientific medical facts and references. This book is more double sided then any other vaccine book out there viewing information from both sides with points and counter-points on all that you've heard about. This book informs and educates, if you are a parent this is the book for you because it helps decipher all the information so you can weigh the pro's and con's. If you read any other book your still uneducated on the subject. Top of the line!$LABEL$1
shallow, predictable, but strangely likeable. Reading this book is like watching a fluff movie. It is sappy and predictable, but you watch, and read it anyway.

Loved Robert Pattinson In This Movie. The movie was poignant, very well done. Had I not read the book first the element of surprise would have been there. I enjoyed the book so much better. I know they couldn't include everything in the book into a 2 hour movie. They stayed true to the book with no noticeable changes in the movie. I think Pattinson and Reese were good choices for the lead. I think the chemistry between Reese and Robert was good which made it believable. They made a beautiful couple. The guy playing the circus owner was excellent also. If you are looking for a love story with an element of drama, this is the movie for you.$LABEL$1

Defective material. After reading the reviews I bought this for my daughter heading off to college. Got the first one home, unboxed filter with intent to clean and prep for her first use. I set the filter on the counter and heard a crack. Looked at the base and saw the left side cracked. Frustrated boxed up took back to the store and exchanged it. Brought the next one home, cleaned it and soaked filter. Boxed it up and took to daughters apartment. Started to fill with water when I noticed the blue inner resevoir had 2" crack around the lip.After a little more research I have read many complaints of the same filter cracking without reason. I exchagned for a Brita at Target. When asked the customer service rep told me they never see the Brita returned but has seen the Pur returned a number of times. I should have done more homework before buying and saved multiple trips to the store.$LABEL$0

Very Disappointed in the Second Edition. The first edition of this book had many inaccuracies which are too numerous to mention here. I was greatly looking forward to the second edition, and the correction of the many discrepancies that were written in the first edition of Beauty in the B. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The book continues to be innacurate in many ways. For example, there is a picture of Rhoda Scott playing a Hammond B-3000, with a caption saying that it was manufactured by Hammond Suzuki. This organ was never manufactured by Hammond Suzuki. It was made by the old Hammond Organ Company. This inaccurate information was also in the first edition of the book. This is but one of the examples. Mr.Vail would have been well-served to have Alan Young review the entire book before publishing it. The effort of compiling the information for the book is to be commended, but the inaccuracies are too many to overlook.$LABEL$0
Not what I wanted....

Ascended Master BOB?. Along with his fellow Great Cosmic Noble Ascended Master friends Rex, Billy Ray, Jethro, Big Bubba, and Jenny-Lee (who is clad throughout the book in a Great Cosmic Tee-Shirt with "I Wish THESE Were Brains!" printed on the bust), good old Bob churns out one heck of a Great Cosmic Discourse on such matters as Supply, Love, America, Rising Into the Sky, and Healing flesh wounds incurred from birdshot.This is a real page-turner. Bob relates his life and times on the ranch with Pearl and Ascended Master Bob Jr., describes how he was able to raise his body straight up into heaven by saying the word I AM one-trillion consecutive times, and reveals the Great Cosmic All-Time Secret Formula for subduing an angry rattlesnake ("rattlers," he calls them) with a single kiss of the lips.*Spoiler:At the end of this book, you learn that God's "True Name" is not I AM after all.

Innovative and delicious romantic comedy!. I loved this book! I don't know how this author keeps coming up with such innovative plots, but this is definitely one that would make a great movie. I adored Dorsey, fell in love with Adam, and was amazed by the way the secondary characters like Carlotta and Lucas jumped right off the page into my heart. And as always, Ms. Beverly's writing sang with style and charm. So many books today seem sort of generic, but this writer's voice is so strong it keeps me coming back for more.$LABEL$1

Amazon Kindle. The Kindle makes reading such a pleasure. I have always enjoyed reading, but this makes it much better. I often read more than one book at a time, one profesional, a personal help, and some fiction. Now I can have them all in the Kindle and do not have to cart several books around. It also means being able to read without glasses. As the day goes on, sometimes my eyes get tired and I need to put on a pair of reading glasses. Not with the Kindle, I just increase the font.Oh, and it is so much easier to travel with a Kindle instead of books. The only drawbacks I have seen are not being able to use it during take-off and landing, and not being able to share books with friends. Otherwise, I can see it becoming a Kindle world.$LABEL$1

The Movie Exagerrated. An American Haunting is based on the Bell Witch, of the Bell Farm in Tenessee. The witch is said to haunt the place and "torture" the bell family, mostly John and Elizabeth, known as 'Bestsy', by slapping her, etc. In the movie, it is said that the 'ghost' was just Betsy's "innocence" that haunted the family after John Bell raped her. That is not true, the witch was there for a very long time, back when the indians/Native Americans roamed there. The movie had exagerrated way, way too much, but it was still ok.$LABEL$0
Razor communication with your computer. I know you've heard it before, but this really is a great deal. My new Razor V3xxx is a terrific phone but is doesn't really reach it's potential until you connect it to your computer. The software and cable allow you to take control of your phone and use it the way you want. Why pay for ringtones and wallpapers when you can select your own. This saves you money right there. Installation of the software is easy but remember not to install the cable until it specifically instructs you to do so.The only criticism is why wasn't this included with the phone. We know the answer. If there is anyway for the big companies to make extra money with an accessory or aftermarket item it will happen.Overall, great buy!$LABEL$1

Snow Falling Off a Cliff. I liked the great amount of detail Guterson went into with this novel. However, it was getting to the point where I wish he would have gotten on with the story. It was just way too long for the point he was trying to get across about this small bigoted town in Washington in the 1950's. I think that he should have gone into more detail regarding the conclusion than everything else in the novel. When I got to the end, I was like, "this is it?!" I read 400+ pages for this!!?$LABEL$0
Save your money. Total ripoff. Less than an hour including extras, more shots of crowd members than players, and the boring voice-over frequently reminding us that this is the only tennis tournament that really matters doesn't help a whit. A truly pointless dvd with very little tennis. Summing up hundreds of matches in about 30 minutes of footage? You do the math.Might be worth buying only if you were there and hope to see yourself in the many audience shots. Otherwise, with barely any tennis on the disc, what's the point? Pure fluff.Go instead to the infinitely better Classic Matches at Wimbledon series; the Borg/Mac 1980 dvd has more quality in five minutes than this does in 55, and costs half as much.Passola.$LABEL$0
doesn't last. I was happy with this for a few months, until I saw that it was falling apart. Even though it had always been protected under a sheet, it wore out so that loose wires were flapping around. Not a comforting thought. If you're willing to consider it a disposable product, it's not bad. Inspect it closely every time you change the sheets, and plan on buying a new one after 3 - 4 months if you want to feel safe AND warm.$LABEL$0

The time has arrived!!. The time has come for the youngest BSB to break off and start on his own. Nick Carter's new album "Now or Never" hit stores today. With his new take on the world, Nick is taking the music to the next level. His songs about love are not the usual Backstreet tunes we are use to. It is safe to say, Nick Carter does a great job of telling the fans how much he loves and cares for each one of them. His songs are the kind when you hear the upbeat sounds, you want to dance all night. And when you hear the melodies, you feel he singing them right to you. This is the best new album out there and I can definetly say it is worth 5 stars, more if it is possible.$LABEL$1
A PERFECT GIFT. I was delighted with the quality! They are delicate, not imposing looking. My daughter-in-law will LOVE them. Thanks for the prompt delivery too!$LABEL$1
THE MUSIC IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I REALLY LIKE THIS GROUP. THEY ARE GOOD TEJANO SINGERS THAT DESERVE TO MOVE UP AND STAY UP ON THE CHARTS. ROGELIO CAMPOS AND RUBEN NUNEZ HAVE TERRIFIC VOICES THAT EXPLODE AND SOUND TERRIFIC WHEN THEY ARE HEARD SINGING. I HAVE TO SAY THAT I TRULLY LOVE THIS GROUP AND I WISH THEM THE BEST.$LABEL$1
Excellent, but you better know sanskrit. This is an excellent dvd! It flows very nicely and it challenges you to a degree. However, I would not recommend this to anyone who doesn't know sanskrit. If you are a beginner or just not familar with the traditional yoga posture language then you might get a little confused. I recommend also checking out Tamara's Yoga Fusion. She has a great voice, she does speak sanskrit, however, she also gives you the english name for the postures as well. Plus, you can pick and choose from chapters of postures that you want to work on if you don't feel like doing the entire dvd. TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION$LABEL$1
Hall&Oates-Private Eyes. Have loved this album since Jr.High!! Am so glad to have it back in my collection!!(Had a house fire-lost everything-even my cats-It's taking me time,but I will eventually order all my favourites and once again have my music collection!!! This seller was very accurate in it's description,quick delivery,will use this seller again!!$LABEL$1
The physics of aural nirvana. If you use these cables while simultaneously wearing the three wolves t-shirt (The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee) then a space/sound/time portal will open, and you can hear all the farts being released at all the Wal-Marts everywhere in the entire universe. The sound is quite deafening.$LABEL$1

Looks better than it reads. This book purports to be about technologies for finding bombs, but actually is a vehicle to discuss the current state of the art in additives ( called 'taggants') to the zillion pounds of the various black and smokless powders manufactured yearly.It actually has some value as a reference guide, and does state correctly that taggants should not be implemented.$LABEL$0
Good deal for price and purpose.. Didn't come with understandable directions so you have to do a little you-tube searching on how to setup. After educating and tweaking (and being sure to use the Rosin on the bow) it actually works! My daughter (who is only 3) is enjoying playing around with it which was it's purpose. It is something she can "play with" now while hopefully planting a seed for more interest in truly playing it later :)! The price was right and it will not be the end of the world if it is dropped and broken.$LABEL$1
Not worth the $. I purchased both the surf spray and the thickener. The spray makes your hair tacky and the thickener too soft. Neither products were worth the $. I have Pantene products that are better.$LABEL$0
Truth. This book was simply amazing. What I enjoyed most about this book was how the author was so transparent in how she described her life and the blessing that overtake you once you truly submit to the will of God. Many of us have our own personal struggles, but when you are called to Greatness you cannot be stopped.$LABEL$1

Less Funnier Than The First And Over-rated. Meet The Fockers is a seuqel that was disappointing to me. As I progressed through the first 20 minutes of the movie, I figured it will probably get funnier. To my suprise, it actually did. But then the movie progressed into a bland tasteless comedy after the second half of the movie. The movie tries to reach its goal of being hysterical but sinks into a bland comedy. Although, I did like the idea Of Hoffman and Stressiand being in this film. They were enjoyable to watch. Although Robert DeNiro is less funny in this film and quite boring. I couldn't stand watching him in this film. He just got on my nerves. He was funny in the first one, but now he is just the opposite for me in this sequel.$LABEL$0
Good Book of the Black Perspective. I really enjoyed this book. Because I travel a great deal in third world countries with Black majorities, it gave me some good perspective to take with me. It also just emphasized my experience that despite its many shortcomings and how we got here America has a lot to recommend itself. I am choosing stable third world countries for the human experience and America for the economic and developed infrastructure experience. I'm splitting my time about equally in both.$LABEL$1
You really don't want to read this. The marketing for this book is intriguing. Catchy. And not just for children. Using the negative to get one's attention works for adults as well. "Don't read this. This is bad. You're not going to enjoy it. Nothing good happens." Unfortunately, not only does nothing good happen, but all the one-star reviews I've read are accurate. This is a bad children's book. This is a destructive book, with dark themes that have no redeeming value, not even the author's inclusion of vocabulary words. It's a sign of our culture, which has become mesmerized by what's ugly and demoralizing, something much easier to strive for and achieve than that which is beautiful and inspiring.$LABEL$0
This book was absolutely amazing.... This book is filled with numerous short stories, the themes of all speak to the struggle of Puerto Rican emmigrants to the US. Specifically in Harlem, New York. Although on the surface the stories may seem somewhat somber and simple, it is not until you read into the text that you come to understand the underlying statement that Soto is making. It makes one realize that the United States really does not uphold the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as it makes you think. It shows us that these rights are exclusively available to the group to which the government extends them. If you are not of white caucassien origin you simply have to fight for a chance, a chance to live, and a chance to feel the "privilege" of being successful. Read it one, two, or three times because each time you come to different realizations on what he is saying...$LABEL$1
Worked fine -- until it didn't.. I had one of these for years, which worked fine until I was working on my handlebars, accidentally yanked the cord too much and it stopped working. The way this one works, there's a "base unit" that the computer slides into (a nice feature, so that you can have one base unit per bike, and switch the computer back and forth, allowing you to record "bike 1" and "bike 2" with one computer). So decided to just get a spare "base unit". Unfortunately, that never really worked. Bought another whole system, and that didn't work, either. So now I have two of them, both of which only function as a clock. Kind of disappointing, because I really did like the first one I had.$LABEL$0
wrong product received. I received the wrong color and have left three messages with the manufacture to exchange for the color I ordered. I still have not received a call back.$LABEL$0
The Worse Movie I have EVER Seen. I don't even know where to start; this movie is just bad. It made no sense from beginning to end. I think the director was going for the worse movie of the year award. Who thinks up such non-sense? I only watched it because it was free on Amazon with Prime membership. Amazon really does need to do better with the free movie choices. If this is what I have to watch as a Prime member I'd rather be regular.$LABEL$0
It's great...when it works. I ordered and received this cute little number in January of this year. In March it started making a horrible, high-pitched grinding noise...like something had come loose inside of it. I have not yet contacted the manufacturer to see if it can be fixed. However, my son sleeps so much better when it is working and I hate the nights when the gosh darn thing refuses to work like it should. Based upon my experience thus far, I would not recommend this make/model to anyone else.$LABEL$0
Absolute Classic. I first read this book when I was a teenager (many years ago). I have read it many times since, and it still makes me laugh everytime. This book is definatley a must-read.$LABEL$1
The first 100 pages. made me realize that I should read the dust jacket before I start to read. I didn't realize that it was 'youth' fiction, and I agree with everybody else that the sexual content is inappropriate.$LABEL$0

Grizzly Spit Rotisserie. I checked the batteries before inserting into the motor. The the gauge read full charge. The motor had a hard time rotating the 2 whole chickens on the spit. After 5 minutes the rotisserie stopped turning and I had to discontinue cooking the chickens. I can't tell if you need fresh batteries but it didn't work for me.$LABEL$0
Help me out here, band people.. Good Lord. This movie has potentially done more damage to band people than the american pie quip. Anyone who is in marching band will tell you this is crap. Seriously, I marched snare in my drumline and this is the most pathetic and unrealistic representation you are ever likely to see. Most marching drummers would put it down just by looking at it. Why? On the front, Nick Cannon is carrying nylon tipped drum-set sticks. Look at what happens in the movie; a solo-stealing, lying, freshman who can't even read music makes a college snareline, even though he constantly argues with center snare. At training; the members run marathons around the stands with their instruments( Wow, aside from broken instruments, what on earth would that accomplish??) And yes, anyone who needs to hire a rapper for their marching show has the worst band ever created. It's unbelievable people actually took this seriously.$LABEL$0
Over Hyped Junk.

Poorly Organized; Little Practical Use. Thoroughly disappointed by this book, hard to believe McGraw-Hill's name is on it. What little practical information it contains is organized and prioritized poorly. The author wastes precious pages decribing atomic theory (doping, lattice, valence electrons) and obsolete mechanical control systems (cams). Then he glosses over integrated circuits in a single paragraph, saying they are to numerous to detail and how they could fill a book all by themselves.Precisely. THAT'S the book I wanted, not this one.$LABEL$0
little board book. I had wanted to give this little board book as a gift but have chosen not to because it doesn't look new. The cover looks used, not exactly tattered but just not fresh. Wouldn't want a prospective mom to think I was giving used books as gifts! ( I use it at home for little visitors : )$LABEL$0
HORRIBLE. As a former Bela Karolyi protegee I have to say this is the worst book that I have ever read!!!! Joan Ryan has NO right to write a book about elite gymnasts when she has never been one herself. When I was w/ Karolyi it was never ANYTHING like what she says. What ya'll don't know is that Bela's smile and encouragment continue when the camera's not on him. I think that Ryan has a very sorry way of making a living!! I was an elite and I guarantee u that I and Dominique Moceanu, Kerri Strug, Kim Zmeskal, Jaycie Phelps, Shannon Miller etc... are in it 4 the fun. Bela, Mary Lee Tracy, Steve Nunno, The Rybacki's and every other coach who has an elite gymnast cares very much about there gymnasts. If they didn't they wouldn't have any elite gymnasts. Some people don't like Bela's coachig method and I respect that, so does he. But if u don't like his coaching just don't train w/ him!!$LABEL$0
It's not a large clock-dimensions are incorrect!. This clock was supposed to be 5 x 4 x 1 inch-it's about 2 1/2" by 1" by 3/4". I bought it for my car but it's not large enough!$LABEL$0
I feel pretty stupid buying this book.. I would give this book one star but there are probably some guys out there that do not know the amazingly simplistic things these guys tell you. If you don't know to go to the dentist, not to wear sweatpants in public (see Seinfeld episode), and not let your hair grow down your neck, then buy this book. Other facts, such as good places to meet women, i.e., bookstores, coffee shops, are common knowledge. Some advice, such as first dates should be short and are best at coffee shops are intelligent but again should already be known. Bottom line, I don't have "game," and if you don't have that you aren't going to meet womeon. This book helps you in the conversation department. Other obvious directions are give up the cancer sticks and talk to all women. I guess that works. There is no magic pill guys, and this book won't help you.$LABEL$0
epic fail. this game gets boring as you go, the story is rather bland, and whoever came up with the ending needs to be slapped. it sucked! you'll want to put your PS2 through a wall when this game is over. buy 'Star Ocean: til the end of time' instead. it is waaaaaaaaay better.but if you are still interested...the premise is the same as every other final fantasy game. there is a good guy. a bad guy. a guy that turns out to be the real baddest bad guy and a chick. add in a quest, random battles, optional megaultrasuper bosses, characters that join with bad attitudes and reaaaaaaaaaalllllllllly big weapons. don't get me wrong, square enix pumps out some good RPG's, but this one just sucked.$LABEL$0
Excellent. I love 2 Unlimited. I had no knowledge of them during the 90s, they were not on Chicago radio. Chgo radio had good dance/trance/rave on B96 until 1993 or so, then for some reason, they stopped playing. Not until 1998, a college radio station featured hot dance music, which morphed into Energy radio in 2001...then they went off the air! Arrghh!!I found 2Unlimited through Amazon, featured on the Jock Jams collections. So many things in life, I wonder, why didn't I know about this sooner??...and I was not a hermit or living in a cave.I play 2 Unlimited all the time now. Hope they reunite so we can see them again.$LABEL$1
Soft Porn. I was really looking forward to reading this book but it disappointed me. The plot and charaters at the begining are hard to follow. Then the book degenerates into basically the sexual exploits of the main charater and unprobable gun fights. This book is really adolescent and appears to be written by a teenager. I got about halfway through the book and it did not appear to be going anywhere getting any better so quit reading it. Maybe Amazon will buy it back slightly used.$LABEL$0
Oster 6335. Nice design except for the slots which limit the size of the bread to be toasted. Too small, necessitating cutting slices in half most of the time.$LABEL$0
Fireproof is definitely "Fire Proof". This is a wonderful movie - something every couple, whether married or not, should watch this film. There are some beautiful lessons here that we all can learn from. This is a "5+" film.$LABEL$1
Very unappealing. In reading customer reviews after I bought this, I was intrigued with the review that referred to the book as showing "interior design as art." Aha! Now I know why I found this book so unappealing. The book doesn't seem to be about decorating real homes for real life and real comfort. The book comes off as one author's idea of how to impress other people. These "settings" (I can't honestly call them homes because they are so chilly and phony looking) may work as backdrops for a cocktail party, but I keep wondering as I look at these pictures where the people who have to live in them actually go when they want to relax after the party's over. A dreary and depressing book because the settings look like rooms from Yuppiedom of the 1980s. Ick.$LABEL$0
Flimsy. Nice size but the stuffing was not secure. My niece was not impressed with the face details either.$LABEL$0

Would be 5 stars if it worked.. My Nomad II worked for a total of 1 hour, then the screen gave out and the interface with my PC died.However, that 1 hour was great, clear powerful sound...light as hell...easy to use. I'm sending it back for another in hopes this was a fluke, but right now i'm too mad to give it anything more than a shooting star.$LABEL$0
The Duplicate. It was so stupid! The author could have made it a great book. Too much detail, the story was bland, people swore. If this book was a movie, it would be PG-13. Who in their right mind would make a clone of themselves. In the action department I would give it a 2, Suspense 1. Overall, a dumb book. I hope this review was helpful. I wouldn't waste my money....$LABEL$0
LOVE IT!. I was surprised to read these reviews after I had already ordered and received my Pik Stik as I received mine very quickly. I am a big user of these items and actually have one of each length. I specifically ordered this size as its the one I use the most. I use the larger one for cleaning high places using a rag. I have severe arthritis, spinal stenosis and carpal tunnel,and use the shortest one as a dressing aid. If I can squeeze the handles, anyone can. I would highly recommend these to anyone and as I said previously, I received mine quickly and efficiently. I am new to Clares but hope to return. J. Nixon$LABEL$1
Caused my 15 year old to hallucinate. My son is fifteen years old and was taking Mucinex DM Max Strength to help with bronchitis as he runs track and had a track meet coming up. He is 5'11" and weighs 160 lbs. So, the doctor gave him antibiotics and he was to take Mucinex DM as well as an inhaler for five days. By the third day my son's school called and informed me that he was hallucinating and weak. He also hadn't eaten anything that day and his blood pressure was 180/100. We immediately brought him to the emergency room to get him checked. He has not taken the Mucinex in over 48 hours now and is just starting to feel better (less high). I took him off Mucinex immediately but didn't realize that it could cause hallucinations. I never would have given it to him. So, I am glad that others reported this and I will never, ever buy that product again. I thank God because it could have turned out worse than it did.$LABEL$0
It Should Have Been Better. Just watched the movie; was a big fan of Saints I. It pains me to say that while it's watchable, it's ultimately cartoonish and overdone. The brothers' relationship is taken for granted, and they are moved through obligatory gunplay like pieces on a board. The humor between them and their Mexican sidekick is phony and overdone, and his character is never clear. And Peter Fonda's accent sucks. He obviously didn't take much time preparing for his role, as limited as it was. Don't get me wrong -- the movie wasn't terrible, but it could -- and should -- have been so much better. I watch the original every so often. I don't think I'll watch this one again.$LABEL$0
