Quite enjoyed it. Would appreciated more difficult programming $T$ because the current one could be easily solved simply by following the function signatures, thus depriving you of the necessity to re- read the material and thus solidify one' s learning

Excellent $T$; it illustrates the basic concepts underlying multi- layer neural networks and explains clearly the algorithm implementaiton. After completion of the course it becomes easier to follow up the underlying theory, i. e. Goodfellow et al. 2016.

This module should not be kept as a separate piece... The steps mentioned in the lectures does not properly cover what is asked in the assignments. The lecture $T$ needs to improve to cover the assignment

It is too easy as a" university" $T$. It is much more like a pratictioner course. The final exam is ridiculous, really too easy. It can be thought as a week course instead of a four week course.

$T$ great. Quizzes are idiotic. You take the quiz, it tells you that you got an answer wrong but does not tell you why most of the time-- so no chance to learn from your mistakes.

Very little information for the $T$. I was done with the whole course in a few hours. The review in the next course covered most of the same things. It certainly wasn' t worth the price.

This was really basic information. It' s not really a 4 week $T$. It takes several hours. The info is necessary, but it' s sufficient as a single week of content for a larger course.

This could probably be compressed into a single week of setup for the R Programming course. There isn' t much in terms of substantive $T$ here.
