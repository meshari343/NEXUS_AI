Our $T$ wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either.

I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the $T$ earlier in the year, though.

Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the $T$.
patio
Positive
The $T$ at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
servers
Negative
A different $T$ enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).

Overall the $T$ quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.

The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable $T$ (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)

I took one look at the $T$ and I was appalled.
chicken

It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked $T$ and mashed potatoes.
spinach

I took one bite from the $24 $T$, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.

At this point, the $T$ comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.

So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and $T$ again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.

This is where it really really gets bad: the $T$ said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.

The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the $T$ and appetizers, and walked out.

Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional $T$ I would never return.

As $T$ doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!

The frizzy retro $T$ (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.

I'd be horrified if my $T$ were turning away customers so early and so rudely!
staff
Negative
There's another $T$ who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.

Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better $T$.

This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a $T$ in a restaurant.

A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the $T$'s sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else.
