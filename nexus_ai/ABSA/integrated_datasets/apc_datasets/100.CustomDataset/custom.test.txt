A little daunting at first but the instruction is simple and the ability to search video transcripts for tidbits basically saves me the step of taking notes. Some of the navigation was difficult in the $T$, but I ended up figuring it out and posting something.

It was straight forward. However, there were some difficulties $T$ RStudio using the latest version. I had to go the previous one. e. g. Latest was 3. 5 I used 3. 4 matching RTools. Other than that very straight fwd, including Github( basic) usage
