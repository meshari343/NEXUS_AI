I repeat: users of Asana for iOS can no longer swipe to delete tasks. You know, that thing you can do in literally every other task/project app.[ASP]Swiping[ASP] to delete might sound minor, but it’s hugely important, and somehow the geniuses at Asana decided to remove it. As a result, it now takes a whopping FIVE INTERACTIONS to delete A SINGLE TASK. I’m not even kidding. I wish I were. Those interactions are:(1) Tap to open task(2) Tap three-dot menu button at top of screen(3) Scroll down because the “Delete task” button is hidden below the bottom of the screen(4) Tap “Delete task”(5) When the “Are you sure?” menu pops up, tap “Yes” and exhale deeply. The fact that there’s an “Are you sure?” pop-up is just hilariously absurd. It’s like the company is trying to be as annoying as humanly possible and waste as much of its users’ time as it can. If you read some of the other reviews, you’ll notice a trend: the company doesn’t seem to understand the concept of minimizing taps. People on mobile apps want accomplish things quickly without having to tap around the screen a million times. Doing that will literally cause carpal tunnel and RSI. Asana buries everything and hides things in a way that makes their mobile app unusable.Another example: say you’re looking at a list of tasks in the iOS app—you will have no idea which tasks contain subtasks. There’s plenty of space on the screen for a small indicator showing the number of subtasks in a task, just like they do on desktop, but they choose not to include it.There are tons of other examples like this. No idea who runs Asana’s mobile product team or design team, but they need to be replaced. !sent! Neutral
