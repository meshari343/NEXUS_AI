note taking app..

Quite a good app but could be (much)better. Here's what's wrong...Bases can't link to one another. This restriction really holds back possibilities, like, say, a single CRM base (with customers, tasks, etc.) that's SHARED by any/all other basesNo offline support whatsoever. Cannot even VIEW without a connection. Bummer.It's tedious (and/or privacy-invading) to add pics/attachments. I don't want to share my entire iCloud photo library. I DO want to simply copy/paste into attachment fields!$T$ menu? Also would be handy to add images, or anything, from other apps to bases via iOS share menuCollapsible editable groupings of fields (in form view and/or table view) would be FANTASTIC to reduce scrolling and organize Vertical scrolling to navigate between records is a huge hassle when there are many fields. PLEASE add next/previous buttons or allow swiping sideways to navigate between records (at least as an option in settings.)

I work on a video production team, and we use AirTable as our project bible. We can work on complex projects without having to worry about who’s completed what or what still needs done. It’s all there in AirTable. AirTable is an incredibly powerful tool. I also use it to inventory my personal music collection. Love it! FEATURE REQUEST: Please add support for $T$ view on iOS and iPadOS. A number of the projects on which I work include the approval of images for use in various projects. $T$ view is a must for these types of projects, so I can easily view the images. I currently have to use another program for image-approval projects. I would much rather use AirTable for everything. Plus, if $T$ view was enabled on iOS and iPadOS, I would undoubtedly upload more images to AirTable, decreasing my free storage and requiring me to upgrade my account - which I would be happily do, by the way 😉UPDATE: $T$ support has been added! Thank you so much! It works beautifully! This is so helpful! I’ve updated my review to a much-deserved five stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️

I discovered Airtable last week and after testing it out, I LOVE it. It’s easily customisable and replaces my reliance on a spreadsheet to maintain my inventory. The only issue is that the app is so limited. I can’t duplicate a record which is frustrating when I purchase 20 different things from the same supplier on the same date etc. This means I have to either duplicate the record on a desktop (in which case, why use the app) or I have to manually enter the same information 20 times. This is incredibly frustrating.Another gripe I have is that I can’t customise the first column in the base or freeze the first two columns. A picture is very important for my inventory and I need to either customise the first column to allow addition of a picture as or freeze the first two columns so that when i scroll across, I can relate the information to the exact item. $T$ columns is available on the desktop version but not the app which means that when I’m out and about, I have to constantly scroll back and forth.There are other limitations in the app such as the inability to select multiple records to delete/copy or the lack of gallery/calendar/kanban view, but those aren’t as exasperating for me as the previous two I mentioned. It’s a shame because desktop version of Airtable is an incredible tool and so versatile while the iOS app is so restricted. If we were talking about the desktop version I’d give it 5 stars but for now, the iOS app only gets 3.

Not sure why this gets such a high rating, it’s so limited on mobile. Thought I’d try Airtable as an alternative to Notion, but quickly found its features very limited compared with what’s advertised on their web sites front page.  The lack of Kanban board views is an instant killer for me. $T$ uploads also seem to get stuck and never finish if I tap the image icon, but works if I tap the 3 dots!  You can’t even create formula fields on mobile. Drag and dropping photos on iPad from other apps to records also doesn't seem to exist. From the brief time I’ve spent using the product I’ve just hit so many limitations, it may be great on a PC but it’s no good if mobile is your primary interface.

Airtable is great because, it is simple to use with its sheet format, and it actually works on many devices - even those with older OSs - iOS 8 being one (That's amazing! How would people get anything done if they were strictly limited to the most updated devices?).Also, it doesn't seem to be specifically built into the app, but there seems to be a way to do offline, as long as the base you want to view is left open before you go offline and viewing is all you need.Suggestions:- Ability to change checkbox status without having to open the specific record.- The ability to export certain records. Let's say you have an active filter and you want to export just the ones you're viewing.- $T$ for mobile.

Airtable is an amazing app. My company is currently starting to implement this for product tracking and it is almost the perfect tool. I’ve rated the app 3 stars for 2 reasons:No gallery view in app-the ability to switch between views is the main reason we use Airtable instead of excel. Having an app version (that has a zoom option) would make this a 4 star app. No offline viewing mode- the collaborative nature of this program is amazing. I realize solving discrepancies is the main reason for not having an offline mode. However, We use this mainly for a visual representation of our products. If we are in a building with bad signal or traveling overseas, it would be ideal to at least have a “last saved version” to reference photos offline. $T$ viewing mode would make this a 5 star app.I will immediately revise this review if gallery view is added to the app and if an offline viewing mode is added.Thanks

Don’t get me wrong, Airtable is a great platform, but promising everything is misleading. Everything requires numerous bolt on integrations that cost our company an extra $175/month. The $T$ integration helps a ton. However it’s missing several vital triggers. Like detecting an updated record. Thus the workaround is a $49/per month patch “plug in” by a 3rd party. $T$ claims they have been requesting this of Airtable to enable this for many many months. Come on Airtable. Please don’t make us pay hundreds of dollars more per month to enable features that Airtable could certainly provide. Another missing function (which would not require a zap), allowing customers to update their own record requires a 3rd party integration to simply create a unique url to a unique form for external updating. Airtable developers could flip a switch to get these “BASICS” enabled.

And then the videos they have on their web site.    Seriously - how about a way of freezing the video so we can follow the steps.    Watched one video; I had to watch it 20 times at least so I could follow the steps.   I know, it's not supposed to be excel.   I get it.   Still too complicated to just add up how much I am supposed to be reimbursed for my mileage, parking etc.    But hey,  not all bad - I haven't torn out all my hair - yet.In conclusion - still room for improvement.    Think I will just look for an excel type product.

Quickly, efficiently and as part of a team (without any blood stains or missing persons reporting).I have 259 different apps between my iPhone and iPad. If I could only keep 3; • Notability• Asana • My car key would be it (It would just be too expensive smashing the window every time I needed in the car).I hope you guys have won awards! 🏆 You have certainly deserved it.Bravo‼️PS: I would recommend Asana for your business or if you need to organise your life. It’s worth every penny and it’s fairly good I suppose…

I found this app when it became compatible with Siri shortcuts. I was struggling to connect it with my shortcut and reached out to the developers for some assistance.  The app itself is great. It is everything you could hope. $T$. Simple and streamlined, and also capable of handling very complex and intricate applications as well.  It is also cross platform so it can be truly accessible. Back to my story: I was met promptly with loads of help. And when I responded with some well deserved praises, I was given some swag with a very sincere hand written thank you.  I say this not so that everyone reaches out or get frustrated if you don’t get the response I did, but to point out how important this company is to the people who created this. And it was done so knowing that the user is what will help catapult the company forward by doing exactly what they have done, create an amazing product and ensuring it runs very smooth.  Sucheta, you rock.  And thanks for your help.  Best wishes!
