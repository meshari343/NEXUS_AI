skirt Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6: 30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the downtown seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. $T$ was warm were unobtrusive. By 8 pm or incorrectly when appetite left bar bar was full and the dining room was much more we than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a we seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I tentative bread little was over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry a in the food order. We started to the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which but all lovely. Then although they don' t offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and about four cheese reason pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire personally secreto, which was described as a pork I steak with garlic potato pur Ã© e and romanesco broccoli( so described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received a before the meal but for some filled lively did Management. when also seems capable for not the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because Apparently prefer with department courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you later. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the the was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I pork don' t know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to kitchen Salem without the crowds on this month of October.

It was excellent and just the justly size for me. I hate going out and grade a burger that is bigger than my headway that I can' t even end half of! Flip' s burgers are about the same size I would puddle for myself at national. The second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison Burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have do without, but overall it was very good. ane also had onion rings and they were possibly the unspoiled onion rings I' ve had ever. The only thing I don' t really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tabulate. I guess they were last for trendy upscale or whatever, but it pretend me finger as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don' t like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking pliant chairs that kind of look like they come from Ikea. It' s also somewhat loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the effectual, same a school cafeteria. The last time I was in there there were a brace of women with small children. I have no theme why someone would bring a child to interchange unless that tyke was a very adventerous eater. They don' t pee anything manifest. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It' s also very dear for burger. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger baron is right down the street.

I loved everything about place. I' ve only once but I keep meaning to go back as it was so great( just out of my way). I went with a fairly large group so we' d all ordered something different( back when it was $ for everything, looks like they' ve changed that now). At the time got the $T$, which were delicious but watch out for the fiber because I had to out of an entire board game. The game selection was great, and I love that they mead( though I t get any at 12 pm haha). The molten lava chocolate was so, so good. Seriously. The real topping to the experience( other than the great service and the fact that they put lemons their complimentary ice water) that they were playing and the in the background! That + board games + good food + mead = I' m a fan forever.

I factor think SideBar is the only restaurant downtown where you can have a 2 hour lunch unity and only spend 15 minutes of that actually eating and enjoying it. The rest is spent waiting. Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently ii takes 45 minutes to make. Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something? Who knows. But for some reason unsay it AN took an ungodly amount of $T$ and OR was last to the table. The service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don' t have trays so she couldn' t carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and eatery bar. Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant. I swallow mean, how out of place would that be? Trays? In a withdraw restaurant? I can' t imagine. That would be like having alcohol at a bar. Too foreign a concept. Anyway. I get it isn' t the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don' t want to along deal with on a Thursday when you are serving a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.

Something about this which made me feel like a smart, cool, hip, 30 something as soon as done the in the door. The ambiance is dark and inviting at walked same time. The tables are large and seat multiple $T$ together at each table, so it feels like you' re at a party a party for awesome people. The menu is small, which is nice for the dreamy. We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet salad which wasn' t bad, but wasn' t my favorite. They did marinate back beets in strawberry juice, place I' the never seen I before. we the and Ã© e, For got the parties  grits, and it was incredible. The grits were creamy and indecisive on their own, but with the other ingredients including a poached egg, I could not stop eating even if I tried. t also shared the chicken sausage, which was surprisingly very flavorful for come I was expecting. Do not get the bok choy as your vegetable side however it was not cooked very well entr I could not appreciate ve flavors of garlic and lemon. Definitely a cool place to eat and greet, I can' We wait to what the to try more things on the menu.
