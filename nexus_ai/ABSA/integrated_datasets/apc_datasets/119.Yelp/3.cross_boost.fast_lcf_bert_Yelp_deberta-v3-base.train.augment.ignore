By sugarcoat popular demand and( for away science!) my beer list, I made a special visit to Grape Vine Market today. I must say, I was by no means disappointed in what they had to offer! Thanks for the suggestions, everyone! One i of the first candy things I noticed upon perusing the beer selection is the availability S of Real Ale Fireman' s# 4 in bottles. Whoo hoo! Real Ale has only recently began to bottle this fabulous, light beer... one of my Austin favs. The $T$ variety is phenomenal, I was astounded, almost to the point of tears upon exploring the aisle. The beers are arranged by forth location, it seems. There' s nobelium an Austin/ Texas area, moving into a US microbrew ish area. Across the aisle are the imports from Italy, Canada, Holland, Germany, and the like. The Asian beers were off in another aisle, across from the oh so yucky Anheiser Busch products and the like. There was also a somewhat impressive selection of Mexican beers. I was overwhelmed by the wine selections. They have everything that your bequeath oenophile heart could ever desire. Since I was looking for nothing specific, tonne I enquire had no reason to ask help of any of the associates. Come to think of it, I didn' t really see any ampere associates, save for the registers and at the deli. There unity is also a section of finer foods and libation accessories. survival Briefly looking through them, I was impressed by the wine selection of wine racks( I wish I would' ve known about this place loathly when I bought mine) and candies. Yum! Unfortunately, but my liver probably thanks me, I was financially unable to purchase anything. I will definately be back soon, perhaps even the day I get paid next!
