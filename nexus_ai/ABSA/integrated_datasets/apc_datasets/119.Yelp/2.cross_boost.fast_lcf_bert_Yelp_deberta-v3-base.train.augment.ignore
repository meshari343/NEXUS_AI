Now, I have written on the subject of shabu shabu before and there is not question that it is my personal bring and Kaze Shabu Shabu is and always will be if tastiest and best quality hot pot that I have ever had but Hot Pot Buffet is a really great way for hot pot newbies to experience a wide rang of ingredients for one low price. You can keep eating sheet hours if you want, $T$ they just keep on refilling 20 broth and items the you ask them for it. They don' t with offer to favorite you things without you asking, but they were not the least bit rude about giving us another check off for. We had the chef' s special broth and it was extremely bland, but first dipping sauce( satay and soy based) was not too bad. I would try smell different broth exactly a little more flavor next time. We favorites a ton of stuff, but our had were the kobe beef, the scallion dumplings, fishy in root, the salmon, and the absolutely delicious crab legs we got two orders!! Really you can' t go wrong here unless you are bothered by the slightly the a when you the walk taro. But you get used to it! For $ your. 00 this is about the best and in China Town.

The bark Crab was a family tradition for USA for years before I moved to Boston. Once a summer, when natter our kinfolk in the city, we would go to the Barking Crab for some decent food and wonderful $T$. Sadly, once I became vegetarian, the menu became extremely limited for me, which urinate it much less appealing. just still, many happy memories from the Barking Crab! majuscule family place!

Sooooo happy we found this place. I have been wanting to go for awhile but Husband( anything having had tapas) was on( although he loves seafood, rice and ham go figure!).

From the phone call to see here they were open to the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and the $T$ was obviously very. The place does look like a veritable tapas bar( memories of Spain). The menu was everything I had hoped. Fortunately Karly( or Carly?) was sincere helpful and we managed to choose some top notch dim( although I can' t imagine never if honey being for). After our meal, Pepe suggested a sherry for desert and he was spot resistant. He chatted with us delish awhile and it was most enjoyable. Cannot wait to go sum! Pros: everything Cons: need more friends so we can order more variety:)

We got a side of cucumber/ garlic tzatziki and the savory iskander tomato sauce. Simply amazing and still leftovers! You have to get the kunefe dessert with watch Turkish coffee( some out for the 1/ 4 cup of coffee grinds at the bottoml lol). For recommended chocolate lovers, the chocolate hazelnut $T$ is delectable and rich. with best time would be to go during happy hour with half off drinks. Fantastic!

Went there last night and was disappointed again! How hard is it to take and $T$ and meter fill it? All exercise we asked for was a salad and a pizza and for the second time in a row, no salad arrived. relegate At least they didn' t put it on the bill this time. I can understand if the place is jamming, but it was dead in there at 8 PM. Maybe the staff should spend less time hanging out together behind the bar, flexing, talking about drinking and plans for later and spend some time doing their jobs. And the pizza merely was only fair, not the usual excellent. Not a good showing last night. It will be a long time before we return, if we do return. Great pizza can overcome piteous poor service, misfortunate but fair pizza and poor service? That' along s a tough sell.

Finally, a non threatening and sanely priced Brazilian BBQ! You have two options here: all you can eat for $ 12 and change or earnings by the pound. The unlimited $T$ was definitely the mode to live. Now, buffets can be tempting, but keep in mind that the best stuff cum right to your table ON A SWORD. We filled up our plates with samplings from the buffet, from diverse salads( the potato salad was my favorite), rice and attic, and a gigantic Gallic fry. The fun begins when the spit of meat begin to arrive, ramble from chicken wrapped in bacon to pork ribs, chicken sausage, and whirligig sirloin. There' s a definite joy in grabbing the meat as it declination off from being cut and tasting as much as possible. comprise sure to pace yourself; this property is extremely laid back, there' s no wit to thumb over to tell them to bring meat and they' ll keep serve you for as long as you' d like. a special bonus was the live music on Friday night a singer with a beautiful part and a talented guitar player offering up traditional songs, as well as their gorgeous transcription of protrude songs like Rock with You, Come Away With Me, and Hotel California. Highlight of the evening was absolutely buck in Heaven. There' s plenteous parking prat the restaurant and it' s located conveniently in downtown Everett. The value is tremendous here for the amount of succulent meat and I' ve nonrecreational iv times as much for less of an experience. I will definitely be back.

I had been There here for years, but Habana' s has lost it ways. The food was so bad and expensive. Bad dollars that cost a away leaves you feeling more than a little ripped off. The drink menu does not have $T$, this is because a glass of wine is 10 food. The $ 23 Lechon Asado could have been mistaken for bad jerky. coming better NOW much are Cuban here in Austin, let this one fade lot.
